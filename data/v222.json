            "Catherine O&quot;Hara is a movie treasure. I went to this movie mostly for her and she did not disappoint. It&#39;s kind of ironic that the movie is about an agressive campaign to finally get an overlooked actress an Oscar nomination and then Ms. O&quot;Hara really did deserve one. That isn&#39;t surprising, though, since Catherine has been turning in skillful comedic performances for years. Most people probably know her as the mother in the Home Alone movies and she was wonderful in those, but she&#39;s done so much more and definitely should have award nominations. The sad thing is that she didn&#39;t get a nomination for this in real life. That was for the year 2006 and no offence to Miss Abigail Breslin but her spot should have gone to Catherine. Abigail was nominated for the overrated Little Miss Sunshine and she was fine but Catherine&#39;s performance was priceless and stayed in my mind a lot longer than anything in LMS. She should have been one of the 5 nominees for Best Supporting Actress. It would be a treat to have her at The Oscars someday. She did get an Emmy nomination in 2010 for her warm and strong performance as the independent aunt in Temple Grandin. The Emmy voters are often more perceptive about outstanding actors."

The fact that the film never shows DW being contacted by the secret surveillance team at the end - leaves the viewer wondering. <br><br>A film shouldn&#39;t end like this w/o good reason. Obviously the incarnated DW is unaware of what happened, but the surveillance team SHOULD know something. There had to have been a log. And someone there might have been asked to eval to final explosion. I found it hard to believe it occurred wo cross references. And it was a filming error NOT to include the autos area security personnel in the ending - bc they saw DW &amp; the girl go in the water &amp; explode. She should have been in their custody in the final scene. And this would have left the script open to a secquel. <br><br>I wish there were more movies like this today.

It may not be impossible but it&#39;s not possible now. Look it is much easier for the powers to be to enter your mind replace or ad false memory. Or even some simple thing someone said to you in the past or something your  experienced in the past that was perseved to ypur conscious mind  to be &quot; insignificant&quot; thus your mind move that experience to your subconscious mind. This can be used to plant per say &quot; a seed&quot;. Then after that &quot; insignifacant experience ( seed) that is planted in your mind is later watered with more seemingly &quot; insignificant&quot;  counsionse experiences once again ypur mind stores them in your unconscious mind. Then later in life a more significant experience happens  when what ever it might be, nature or what some like to call humans( sorry everything is Nature is my pov) causes that seed to sprout thus entering your consciousness in a way that seems like it always existed a hard wired memory. Humans must begin to understand your body but a vessel for your mind. You hit your toe you mind tells your toe it got hit not the other way around because nerves don&#39;t &quot;think&quot; your mind thinks. Understand this Neuroscientist will tell you your mind is broken up into different parts and each part does different things. This is true I believe it. But what they dont tell you is that you subconscious mind encompasses all of those parts into a whole. One thing I will give the movie. Time stamp <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxdS8TP37I4&amp;t=1984\">33:04</a> on Hulu streaming. Denzel Washinghtons character says &quot; which one of the 7 drorfs is giving the audio&quot;. The audio coming from the minds of the people who are walking around. Understand people. I am not veiwed through cameras nor heard through microphones. I am heard through my mind. My eyes see a light bulbs but they don&#39;t see a light bulb like I see it because it is the mind procces my personal mind proccessing the light bulb so &quot; they&quot; see through their mind what they see as a the same lightbulb. But don&#39;t worry I&#39;m getting better at thinking multiple thoughts at the same time when looking at something or hearing something and everyday my conscience mind creates new pathways into my subconscious when I&#39;m conscious or sleeping and I will be able to scramble the signal they extract from mind to the point it will begin to travel through their minds and any mind they have ever entered to the point the actual thought my subconscious wanted to send reaches another mind like mine. One that is truely free from the chains of the idea that &quot; humanity&quot; exists it will reach a mind that is being held hostage like mine but that thought that was not understandable by the previous minds it past through because those minds are so far from their nature, their mind. I will wake the minds of the ones in the world that have been walking like zombies not knowing their minds are being heard to. Only problem  for every One who believes humanity does not include nature( nature not mother earth not a single thing nature as a whole a singularity of all exsistamce in the universe known and unknown) will not ever know the thought was sent because they are blind to their nature and only can see humanity and plants and molecules as individual and not as a whole.",

Since then, I&#39;ve worn out my DVD copy of the film.<br><br>In the trailer and in the movie Denzel&#39;s character (Doug CarLinn) may have been trapped in a <b>time loop.</b>   Hence, the title of the movie &quot;Deja Vu&quot; (literally &quot;Already Seen&quot;).<br><br>In the movie, Erika Alexander&#39;s character (Shanti) points out that <b>old timelines probably disappear</b> (eventually).  So, at the end of the movie, the horrible traffic accidents that Denzel caused in the old timeline <b>might not exist anymore --until Doug causes them again, if he does.  (Alternatively, the traffic accident injuries sustained in the old timeline might show up as *birthmarks or congenital ailments</b> in the new timeline). <br><br>If some events from the old timeline don&#39;t disappear right away, that might explain anomalies like the multicolored writing <b>(&quot;You Can Save Her&quot;)</b> that Denzel discovers on Claire Kuchever&#39;s refrigerator.  Incidentally, in the trailer, Claire&#39;s refrigerator seems to undergo a <b>&quot;Mandela Effect&quot;</b> type of change from brown to white.  Furthermore, in the trailer, there&#39;s a photo of a dog posted on Claire&#39;s refrigerator --but Denzel finds a (Mandela Effect?) pet cat roaming around Claire&#39;s house. <br><br>A concept ike <b>&quot;superposition&quot;</b> might help to explain how Claire Kuchever can be <b>both alive and dead</b> at the same time.  I&#39;m uncertain about the status of <b>Claire&#39;s cat*.  But I&#39;m fascinated by the prospect that the animal may be *both cat and dog</b> at the same time (in different timelines).

            "There was I agree with you - but I think it is good it focused so much on the political unrest of the day, it just made it so much more powerful when it came to the end. And I loved how we got to see the hope RFK offered to the Mexican and African American community. It is Freddy Rodriguez&#39;s body language and facial expression at the end that always get me, he just shows the loss of hope for a whole community of people in that sad little face lol.",

Out of all the characters in this movie probably about 80% of them are real people that were there that night.  Even if you don&#39;t like this movie you can&#39;t deny the fact that RFK was probably one of our best leaders and it&#39;s sad that we don&#39;t have people like him in the government right now:-/",

Jack Black steps out of his &quot;norm&quot; and plays a really good serious/drama roll - I think he&#39;s underrated in this genera and should do more movies like &quot;The Holiday&quot;. All 4 actors/actresses have great chemistry throughout the movie. There are a few tear-jerking parts that seem increasingly hard to come by in romcoms. This movie isn&#39;t just for girls, the guys will like it, too. The plot is unoriginal - was a very good script, which made it very easy on the actors. Filled with some life lessons and feel-good moments. Would recommend to anyone who&#39;s a Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law or Jack Black fan.

With the help of some magic, memory-inducing candy, Celine and Julie get plugged into a bizarre drama in a mysterious, possibly haunted, house. They enter the house in the guise of nurses and encounter two women, who are in love with the same man. The man is a widower who had promised his wife that he would not remarry as long as their invalid daughter was alive. As the competition in the triangle reaches a murderous level, the high- spirited heroines plot a daring rescue of the young victim. One of the seminal films of seventies, CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING is a brilliant meditation on the art of cinema and the nature of fantasy. It is regarded by many as New Wave master Jacques Rivette's (LA BELLE NOISEUSE) most accomplished film.",

The book was based on the Warden's personal experiences; Warner Bros. studio just bought the rights to the title, and created their own fictional story as follows.\n\nTom Connors is a criminal sentenced to Sing Sing. His girlfriend Fay is injured and Warden Long arrainges for Tom to visit her on his honor to return. While there he gets a fight with mobster Joe Finn and Fay shoots Finn. Tom jumps out the window and is blamed for the death.

The rule is: bandit, when he decides to be good, pays the price with his life . 20,000 years in Sing Sing it does not discuss in depth the shortcomings of the prison system. However , to humanize Tommy Connors (Spencer Tracy ) , the story manages to make the audience reflect on the story and to put yourself in someone willing to correct their mistakes of the past.

OSS 117 who in the tradition of Maxwell Smart and Inspector Clouseau somehow succeeds in spite of his ineptitude.\r\n\r\nAfter a fellow agent and close friend is murdered, Hubert is ordered to take his place at the head of a poultry firm in Cairo. This is to be his cover while he investigates Jack's death, monitors the Suez Canal, checks up on the Brits and Soviets, burnishes France's reputation, quells a fundamentalist rebellion and brokers peace in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nA blithe and witty send-up not only of spy films of that era and the suave secret agent figure but also neo-colonialism, ethnocentrism and the very idea of Western covert action in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nSparkling production design, a jubilantly retro score and a genuine flair for using the film and TV vocabulary of the '60s to revisit colonial arrogance put pic in the same conceptual ballpark as Austin Powers or 'The Naked Gun' series. - Variety",

And its bold protagonist, who along with having a herculean body is also a surgeon, linguist and inventor, remains determined to do right to all and wrong to no one. Ron Ely (TV's Tarzan) plays the strapping Savage in this high-camp, big-heroics tale of his trek into the Valley of the Vanished to confront the power-hungry Captain Seas (Paul Wexler). And behind the camera are pros who know how to get the most out of this entertainment bronze mine: veteran fantasy film producer George Pal (The War of the Worlds, The Time Machine) and director Michael Anderson (Around the World in 80 Days, Logan's Run).\n\nDirected By Michael Anderson\nStarring Ron Ely, Paul Gleason, William Lucking\n\nSubscribe to watch more Warner Archive videos: https://www.youtube.com/c/warnerarchive?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFOLLOW WARNER ARCHIVE ON SOCIAL\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/warnerarchive\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/warnerarchive\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/warnerarchive\n\nABOUT WARNER ARCHIVE\nWarner Archive Collection is a branch of Warner Bros home entertainment that releases classic films and TV that were previously unreleased.

But the major networks and some cable channels are doing lots of action/adventure fare (Agents of SHIELD, Walking Dead). A Doc Savage show would not cut it with all the choices we have today.",

            "I&#39;ll grant the film had flaws (notably, casting for the roles of Ham and Monk, who as portrayed were blatant caricatures), but on the whole it was a damn fine movie. I saw it in the theater and enjoyed it immensely. And Ron&#39;s acting limitations were not really an issue, as Doc SHOULD be played low key and understated (much as Peter Weller did a few years later with Buckaroo Banzai, who&#39;s essentially the same character). I&#39;ll concur that a little more Raiders of the Lost Ark approach would have improved it, but there were textual limitations involved (for example, after the first few stories, Doc &amp; Co. stopped using real guns; no more killing allowed. That sort of restriction would have made a real dent in Indy&#39;s adventures too)...",

        "description": "It's Christmas Eve and a huge blizzard has just shut down the airport, threatening to ruin holiday plans for all stranded travelers. Snowed in en route to their father's house, two \"Unaccompanied Minors\"--dubbed UMs--Spencer (Dyllan Christopher) and his little sister, Katherine (Dominique Saldana), are ushered to the airport's Unaccompanied Minors Room, a holding cell for dozens of stranded, parent-free kids from all over the country. Caught in the crossfire of projectile cupcakes and juice boxes and desperate to escape, Spencer makes a run for freedom along with four other UMs, who couldn't be more different if they tried: spoiled rich girl Grace (Gina Mantegna), trailer-park tomboy Donna (Quinn Shephard), academic overachiever Charlie (Tyler James Williams) and comic-book geek Timothy Wellington a.k.a. \"Beef\" (Brett Kelly). With the airport's peevish Passenger Relations Manager Oliver Porter (Lewis Black), his lackey assistant Zach Van Bourke (Wilmer Valderrama) and every airport security guard hot on their trails, this group of UMs from cliques that don't mix learn to ditch their differences and help each other flee the clutches of airport authority. Meanwhile, Katherine and the other UMs have been herded to a nearby hotel to wait out the storm. Determined to reunite with his little sister and fulfill her unspoiled vision of Santa Claus arriving on Christmas morning, Spencer enlists the help of his UM posse. Working together as an unlikely family of their own, they outwit and outrun Oliver and his crew. Plummeting through baggage chutes, rummaging around unclaimed luggage and canoeing down a snow-covered hill, they turn Christmas at the airport into holiday pandemonium and, along the way, prove that the holidays aren't about where you are, but who you're with.

            "Great commentary and a great film. It had just as much heart as the 1st film and made up for Rocky V in a big way. It also shows that Stallone knew what he was doing and defiantly knew what he wanted. \u00a0It was a small movie that felt like a big movie and that was also what made it great because the original was a small movie that felt like a big movie as well.\u00a0",
            "This movie was better than I anticipated. I didn&#39;t like some of the stupid handheld camera shots, but I really enjoyed the movie. And like NostalgiNorden said, the parallel between Rocky and Stallone fighting for their dignity is not coincidental.\u00a0",
            "Interestingly, his late son was going to return to play his son in the film, but when Stallone looked at the script, especially the line where the son complains that he spent his whole life &#39;living in his shadow&#39; Stallone felt this was like a slap in the face to his kid, and could also be seen by outsiders as a Stallone stroking his own ego, which it wasn&#39;t meant to be. So Milo Ventimiglia was cast instead. There was alot of consideration went into this film, which was more than many realised. And I was one of those who thought this film wouldn&#39;t work...and so I didn&#39;t see it cinemas, but watched it on TV...I loved it, it was heartrending and heartbreaking and inspiring, and it managed to drag me into its world. I actually felt bad for doubting Stallone.<br>That same year, Sharon Stone tried a return to her former glory with Basic Instinct 2...unlike Rocky Balboa, it was a razzie winning disaster, earning the nickname Basically It Stinks.",

In desperate need of money to pay for his sister's hospital bills, Jack robs a local fish market (armed with a frozen lobster and an edible balaclava) and mails the cash to himself. When the package goes missing en route, he fears the police may be on to him or that someone in the community has intercepted the loot. So when local beauty Pearl starts parading round in very expensive shoes, Jacks starts to get suspicious. Whilst trying not to fall in love, Jack tries various ploys to flush out the culprit, including kidnapping Pearl's beloved dog. 2004 Film Finance Corporation Australia Ltd, The Third Mezzanine Film Fund LLP, The Premium Movie Partnership, New South Wales Film and Television Office, Anthony  Buckley Films Pty Ltd and Oyster Farmer (UK) Ltd",

It may have helped to add to the contrast of the outside world and Shangri-La. Also, I remembered that Peter O&#39;Toole starred in a musical version of Goodbye, Mr. Chips. The author of Lost Horizon, James Hilton, also wrote Goodbye, Mr. Chips. I checked to see if there was a musical version of Random Harvest, also by the same author. Thankfully, there was not.

A briefcase containing plans for the fake invasion is attached to a body dressed as a British major and given an elaborate false identity. The 'man who never was' is then left at sea for the Germans to find. However, Nazi intelligence believes that the find may be just too good to be true -- and a desperate cat-and-mouse game begins in the heart of war torn London...\n\nStarring:\nRobert Flemyng\nClifton Webb\nGloria Grahame\n\nDirector: Ronald Neame\n\nAvailable on BluRay from http://www.odeonent.co.uk/product/the-man-who-never-was",

At a talent competition, they are discovered by an ambitious manager named Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx), who offers them the opportunity of a lifetime: to become the back-up singers for headliner James \"Thunder\" Early (Eddie Murphy). Curtis gradually takes control of the girls' look and sound, eventually giving them their own shot in the spotlight as The Dreams. That spotlight, however, begins to narrow in on Deena, finally pushing the less attractive Effie out altogether. Though the Dreams become a crossover phenomenon, they soon realize that the cost of fame and fortune may be higher than they ever imagined.\n\nRounding out the main cast are Keith Robinson (\"Fat Albert\"), Sharon Leal (TV's \"Boston Public\"), and three-time Tony Award winner Hinton Battle (\"Miss Saigon,\" \"The Tap Dance Kid,\" \"The Wiz\").\n\n\"Dreamgirls\" is being directed by Bill Condon from a screenplay he adapted from the stage musical's original book by Tom Eyen. An Academy Award\u00ae winner for his screenplay for \"Gods and Monsters,\" which he also directed, Condon received another Oscar\u00ae nomination for his screenplay adaptation of \"Chicago.\" He more recently wrote and directed \"Kinsey.\"\n\nAcademy Award\u00ae-nominated producer Laurence Mark (\"Jerry Maguire,\" \"As Good As It Gets,\" \"I, Robot\") is producing \"Dreamgirls,\" with Patricia Whitcher (\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\" \"The Terminal\") executive producing. The lyrics are by Tom Eyen, with music by Henry Krieger.\n\nCast: Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover, Anika Noni Rose, Jennifer Hudson, Keith Robinson, Bobby Slayton\n\nStudio: DreamWorks Pictures (Paramount)\nDirector: Bill Condon\nScreenwriter: Bill Condon\nGenre: Drama, Musical\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.dreamworks.com/dreamgirls",

Now, I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t kids who do turn around, but some just will never get motivated about education, and I don&#39;t like how they blame the school system for that, and really, would a 9th grade English teacher really be racist?",

Told in flashback as the artist (Nigel Terry - Troy) lies dying in poverty, the film brilliantly recreates the look and colour of Caravaggio's original paintings while exploring the homoerotic subtext of his work. Speculating on the artist's relationship with his model Ranuccio (Sean Bean - Lord of the Rings), the film explores a vicious love triangle also involving the model's wife, played brilliantly by Tilda Swinton (Orlando, Michael Clayton) Jarman's muse and collaborator throughout several films, this was Swinton's first feature role. With luscious production design it was the first major film production for award-winning costume designer Sandy Powell (The Aviator, Skakespeare in Love) the dazzling Caravaggio is arguably the most accessible of Jarman's films.",

Here he plays an innocent abroad, one who is befelled by nothing but misery, bad luck and misfortune. He then decides to turn to the dark side, where he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams.",

Therefore the Imperial Japanese Army is desperate to prevent it from falling into American hands and providing a launching point for an invasion of Japan. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi is given command of the forces on the island and sets out to prepare for the imminent attack. General Kuribayashi, however, does not favor the rigid traditional approach recommended by his subordinates, and resentment and resistance fester among his staff. In the lower echelons, a young soldier, Saigo, a poor baker in civilian life, strives with his friends to survive the harsh regime of the Japanese army itself, all the while knowing that a fierce battle looms. When the American invasion begins, both Kuribayashi and Saigo find strength, honor, courage, and horrors beyond imagination.",

Whether swinging a hot number with Bob Crosby's orchestra or emoting a hilariously hammy version of Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene, Judy is a delight as a stage-struck Hoosier in this charming film based on Booth Tarkington's novel. Lily just knows she has the talent to light up the Great White Way, so when a big Broadway producer (Van Heflin) visits her hometown, she expends all the candlepower of her charisma to impress him. He's not impressed. He heads back to New York and Lily follows, thumbing her way east on what she's sure is a one-way trip to instant stardom. At a mere 20 years old, Judy had already reached stardom. Presenting Lily Mars proves why, showcasing her once-in-a-generation voice, gift for comedy and enduring movie magnetism. Break a leg, Lily! #Trailer #WB",

            "Catherine O&quot;Hara is a movie treasure. I went to this movie mostly for her and she did not disappoint. It&#39;s kind of ironic that the movie is about an agressive campaign to finally get an overlooked actress an Oscar nomination and then Ms. O&quot;Hara really did deserve one. That isn&#39;t surprising, though, since Catherine has been turning in skillful comedic performances for years. Most people probably know her as the mother in the Home Alone movies and she was wonderful in those, but she&#39;s done so much more and definitely should have award nominations. The sad thing is that she didn&#39;t get a nomination for this in real life. That was for the year 2006 and no offence to Miss Abigail Breslin but her spot should have gone to Catherine. Abigail was nominated for the overrated Little Miss Sunshine and she was fine but Catherine&#39;s performance was priceless and stayed in my mind a lot longer than anything in LMS. She should have been one of the 5 nominees for Best Supporting Actress. It would be a treat to have her at The Oscars someday. She did get an Emmy nomination in 2010 for her warm and strong performance as the independent aunt in Temple Grandin. The Emmy voters are often more perceptive about outstanding actors."

There was a number of unauthorized versions, including one on MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, and a film with Warren Beatty.  Then, there was a comedy version, to cash in on the spy craze of the day--forgetable film with a great cast.  Then finally, there was this one, coming the full circle to try to do justice to Ian Fleming&#39;s novel.  Check the biographies.  I think it was inspired by a real event in Ian Fleming&#39;s wartime career.  His plan failed, and the bad guy skinned him for all his money, but then Fleming got the last laugh with a successful novel and a number of film and TV productions.",

The fact that the film never shows DW being contacted by the secret surveillance team at the end - leaves the viewer wondering. <br><br>A film shouldn&#39;t end like this w/o good reason. Obviously the incarnated DW is unaware of what happened, but the surveillance team SHOULD know something. There had to have been a log. And someone there might have been asked to eval to final explosion. I found it hard to believe it occurred wo cross references. And it was a filming error NOT to include the autos area security personnel in the ending - bc they saw DW &amp; the girl go in the water &amp; explode. She should have been in their custody in the final scene. And this would have left the script open to a secquel. <br><br>I wish there were more movies like this today.

It may not be impossible but it&#39;s not possible now. Look it is much easier for the powers to be to enter your mind replace or ad false memory. Or even some simple thing someone said to you in the past or something your  experienced in the past that was perseved to ypur conscious mind  to be &quot; insignificant&quot; thus your mind move that experience to your subconscious mind. This can be used to plant per say &quot; a seed&quot;. Then after that &quot; insignifacant experience ( seed) that is planted in your mind is later watered with more seemingly &quot; insignificant&quot;  counsionse experiences once again ypur mind stores them in your unconscious mind. Then later in life a more significant experience happens  when what ever it might be, nature or what some like to call humans( sorry everything is Nature is my pov) causes that seed to sprout thus entering your consciousness in a way that seems like it always existed a hard wired memory. Humans must begin to understand your body but a vessel for your mind. You hit your toe you mind tells your toe it got hit not the other way around because nerves don&#39;t &quot;think&quot; your mind thinks. Understand this Neuroscientist will tell you your mind is broken up into different parts and each part does different things. This is true I believe it. But what they dont tell you is that you subconscious mind encompasses all of those parts into a whole. One thing I will give the movie. Time stamp <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxdS8TP37I4&amp;t=1984\">33:04</a> on Hulu streaming. Denzel Washinghtons character says &quot; which one of the 7 drorfs is giving the audio&quot;. The audio coming from the minds of the people who are walking around. Understand people. I am not veiwed through cameras nor heard through microphones. I am heard through my mind. My eyes see a light bulbs but they don&#39;t see a light bulb like I see it because it is the mind procces my personal mind proccessing the light bulb so &quot; they&quot; see through their mind what they see as a the same lightbulb. But don&#39;t worry I&#39;m getting better at thinking multiple thoughts at the same time when looking at something or hearing something and everyday my conscience mind creates new pathways into my subconscious when I&#39;m conscious or sleeping and I will be able to scramble the signal they extract from mind to the point it will begin to travel through their minds and any mind they have ever entered to the point the actual thought my subconscious wanted to send reaches another mind like mine. One that is truely free from the chains of the idea that &quot; humanity&quot; exists it will reach a mind that is being held hostage like mine but that thought that was not understandable by the previous minds it past through because those minds are so far from their nature, their mind. I will wake the minds of the ones in the world that have been walking like zombies not knowing their minds are being heard to. Only problem  for every One who believes humanity does not include nature( nature not mother earth not a single thing nature as a whole a singularity of all exsistamce in the universe known and unknown) will not ever know the thought was sent because they are blind to their nature and only can see humanity and plants and molecules as individual and not as a whole.",

Since then, I&#39;ve worn out my DVD copy of the film.<br><br>In the trailer and in the movie Denzel&#39;s character (Doug CarLinn) may have been trapped in a <b>time loop.</b>   Hence, the title of the movie &quot;Deja Vu&quot; (literally &quot;Already Seen&quot;).<br><br>In the movie, Erika Alexander&#39;s character (Shanti) points out that <b>old timelines probably disappear</b> (eventually).  So, at the end of the movie, the horrible traffic accidents that Denzel caused in the old timeline <b>might not exist anymore --until Doug causes them again, if he does.  (Alternatively, the traffic accident injuries sustained in the old timeline might show up as *birthmarks or congenital ailments</b> in the new timeline). <br><br>If some events from the old timeline don&#39;t disappear right away, that might explain anomalies like the multicolored writing <b>(&quot;You Can Save Her&quot;)</b> that Denzel discovers on Claire Kuchever&#39;s refrigerator.  Incidentally, in the trailer, Claire&#39;s refrigerator seems to undergo a <b>&quot;Mandela Effect&quot;</b> type of change from brown to white.  Furthermore, in the trailer, there&#39;s a photo of a dog posted on Claire&#39;s refrigerator --but Denzel finds a (Mandela Effect?) pet cat roaming around Claire&#39;s house. <br><br>A concept ike <b>&quot;superposition&quot;</b> might help to explain how Claire Kuchever can be <b>both alive and dead</b> at the same time.  I&#39;m uncertain about the status of <b>Claire&#39;s cat*.  But I&#39;m fascinated by the prospect that the animal may be *both cat and dog</b> at the same time (in different timelines).

Utterly amazing performance from him and the rest of the cast.",

And I loved how we got to see the hope RFK offered to the Mexican and African American community. It is Freddy Rodriguez&#39;s body language and facial expression at the end that always get me, he just shows the loss of hope for a whole community of people in that sad little face lol.",

Out of all the characters in this movie probably about 80% of them are real people that were there that night.  Even if you don&#39;t like this movie you can&#39;t deny the fact that RFK was probably one of our best leaders and it&#39;s sad that we don&#39;t have people like him in the government right now:-/",

Jack Black steps out of his &quot;norm&quot; and plays a really good serious/drama roll - I think he&#39;s underrated in this genera and should do more movies like &quot;The Holiday&quot;. All 4 actors/actresses have great chemistry throughout the movie. There are a few tear-jerking parts that seem increasingly hard to come by in romcoms. This movie isn&#39;t just for girls, the guys will like it, too. The plot is unoriginal - was a very good script, which made it very easy on the actors. Filled with some life lessons and feel-good moments. Would recommend to anyone who&#39;s a Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law or Jack Black fan.

With the help of some magic, memory-inducing candy, Celine and Julie get plugged into a bizarre drama in a mysterious, possibly haunted, house. They enter the house in the guise of nurses and encounter two women, who are in love with the same man. The man is a widower who had promised his wife that he would not remarry as long as their invalid daughter was alive. As the competition in the triangle reaches a murderous level, the high- spirited heroines plot a daring rescue of the young victim. One of the seminal films of seventies, CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING is a brilliant meditation on the art of cinema and the nature of fantasy. It is regarded by many as New Wave master Jacques Rivette's (LA BELLE NOISEUSE) most accomplished film.",

The book was based on the Warden's personal experiences; Warner Bros. studio just bought the rights to the title, and created their own fictional story as follows.\n\nTom Connors is a criminal sentenced to Sing Sing. His girlfriend Fay is injured and Warden Long arrainges for Tom to visit her on his honor to return. While there he gets a fight with mobster Joe Finn and Fay shoots Finn. Tom jumps out the window and is blamed for the death.

The rule is: bandit, when he decides to be good, pays the price with his life . 20,000 years in Sing Sing it does not discuss in depth the shortcomings of the prison system. However , to humanize Tommy Connors (Spencer Tracy ) , the story manages to make the audience reflect on the story and to put yourself in someone willing to correct their mistakes of the past.

OSS 117 who in the tradition of Maxwell Smart and Inspector Clouseau somehow succeeds in spite of his ineptitude.\r\n\r\nAfter a fellow agent and close friend is murdered, Hubert is ordered to take his place at the head of a poultry firm in Cairo. This is to be his cover while he investigates Jack's death, monitors the Suez Canal, checks up on the Brits and Soviets, burnishes France's reputation, quells a fundamentalist rebellion and brokers peace in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nA blithe and witty send-up not only of spy films of that era and the suave secret agent figure but also neo-colonialism, ethnocentrism and the very idea of Western covert action in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nSparkling production design, a jubilantly retro score and a genuine flair for using the film and TV vocabulary of the '60s to revisit colonial arrogance put pic in the same conceptual ballpark as Austin Powers or 'The Naked Gun' series. - Variety",

And its bold protagonist, who along with having a herculean body is also a surgeon, linguist and inventor, remains determined to do right to all and wrong to no one. Ron Ely (TV's Tarzan) plays the strapping Savage in this high-camp, big-heroics tale of his trek into the Valley of the Vanished to confront the power-hungry Captain Seas (Paul Wexler). And behind the camera are pros who know how to get the most out of this entertainment bronze mine: veteran fantasy film producer George Pal (The War of the Worlds, The Time Machine) and director Michael Anderson (Around the World in 80 Days, Logan's Run).\n\nDirected By Michael Anderson\nStarring Ron Ely, Paul Gleason, William Lucking\n\nSubscribe to watch more Warner Archive videos: https://www.youtube.com/c/warnerarchive?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFOLLOW WARNER ARCHIVE ON SOCIAL\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/warnerarchive\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/warnerarchive\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/warnerarchive\n\nABOUT WARNER ARCHIVE\nWarner Archive Collection is a branch of Warner Bros home entertainment that releases classic films and TV that were previously unreleased.

But the major networks and some cable channels are doing lots of action/adventure fare (Agents of SHIELD, Walking Dead). A Doc Savage show would not cut it with all the choices we have today.",

            "I&#39;ll grant the film had flaws (notably, casting for the roles of Ham and Monk, who as portrayed were blatant caricatures), but on the whole it was a damn fine movie. I saw it in the theater and enjoyed it immensely. And Ron&#39;s acting limitations were not really an issue, as Doc SHOULD be played low key and understated (much as Peter Weller did a few years later with Buckaroo Banzai, who&#39;s essentially the same character). I&#39;ll concur that a little more Raiders of the Lost Ark approach would have improved it, but there were textual limitations involved (for example, after the first few stories, Doc &amp; Co. stopped using real guns; no more killing allowed. That sort of restriction would have made a real dent in Indy&#39;s adventures too)...",

        "description": "It's Christmas Eve and a huge blizzard has just shut down the airport, threatening to ruin holiday plans for all stranded travelers. Snowed in en route to their father's house, two \"Unaccompanied Minors\"--dubbed UMs--Spencer (Dyllan Christopher) and his little sister, Katherine (Dominique Saldana), are ushered to the airport's Unaccompanied Minors Room, a holding cell for dozens of stranded, parent-free kids from all over the country. Caught in the crossfire of projectile cupcakes and juice boxes and desperate to escape, Spencer makes a run for freedom along with four other UMs, who couldn't be more different if they tried: spoiled rich girl Grace (Gina Mantegna), trailer-park tomboy Donna (Quinn Shephard), academic overachiever Charlie (Tyler James Williams) and comic-book geek Timothy Wellington a.k.a. \"Beef\" (Brett Kelly). With the airport's peevish Passenger Relations Manager Oliver Porter (Lewis Black), his lackey assistant Zach Van Bourke (Wilmer Valderrama) and every airport security guard hot on their trails, this group of UMs from cliques that don't mix learn to ditch their differences and help each other flee the clutches of airport authority. Meanwhile, Katherine and the other UMs have been herded to a nearby hotel to wait out the storm. Determined to reunite with his little sister and fulfill her unspoiled vision of Santa Claus arriving on Christmas morning, Spencer enlists the help of his UM posse. Working together as an unlikely family of their own, they outwit and outrun Oliver and his crew. Plummeting through baggage chutes, rummaging around unclaimed luggage and canoeing down a snow-covered hill, they turn Christmas at the airport into holiday pandemonium and, along the way, prove that the holidays aren't about where you are, but who you're with.

            "Great commentary and a great film. It had just as much heart as the 1st film and made up for Rocky V in a big way. It also shows that Stallone knew what he was doing and defiantly knew what he wanted. \u00a0It was a small movie that felt like a big movie and that was also what made it great because the original was a small movie that felt like a big movie as well.\u00a0",
            "This movie was better than I anticipated. I didn&#39;t like some of the stupid handheld camera shots, but I really enjoyed the movie. And like NostalgiNorden said, the parallel between Rocky and Stallone fighting for their dignity is not coincidental.\u00a0",
            "Interestingly, his late son was going to return to play his son in the film, but when Stallone looked at the script, especially the line where the son complains that he spent his whole life &#39;living in his shadow&#39; Stallone felt this was like a slap in the face to his kid, and could also be seen by outsiders as a Stallone stroking his own ego, which it wasn&#39;t meant to be. So Milo Ventimiglia was cast instead. There was alot of consideration went into this film, which was more than many realised. And I was one of those who thought this film wouldn&#39;t work...and so I didn&#39;t see it cinemas, but watched it on TV...I loved it, it was heartrending and heartbreaking and inspiring, and it managed to drag me into its world. I actually felt bad for doubting Stallone.<br>That same year, Sharon Stone tried a return to her former glory with Basic Instinct 2...unlike Rocky Balboa, it was a razzie winning disaster, earning the nickname Basically It Stinks.",

In desperate need of money to pay for his sister's hospital bills, Jack robs a local fish market (armed with a frozen lobster and an edible balaclava) and mails the cash to himself. When the package goes missing en route, he fears the police may be on to him or that someone in the community has intercepted the loot. So when local beauty Pearl starts parading round in very expensive shoes, Jacks starts to get suspicious. Whilst trying not to fall in love, Jack tries various ploys to flush out the culprit, including kidnapping Pearl's beloved dog. 2004 Film Finance Corporation Australia Ltd, The Third Mezzanine Film Fund LLP, The Premium Movie Partnership, New South Wales Film and Television Office, Anthony  Buckley Films Pty Ltd and Oyster Farmer (UK) Ltd",

It may have helped to add to the contrast of the outside world and Shangri-La. Also, I remembered that Peter O&#39;Toole starred in a musical version of Goodbye, Mr. Chips. The author of Lost Horizon, James Hilton, also wrote Goodbye, Mr. Chips. I checked to see if there was a musical version of Random Harvest, also by the same author. Thankfully, there was not.

A briefcase containing plans for the fake invasion is attached to a body dressed as a British major and given an elaborate false identity. The 'man who never was' is then left at sea for the Germans to find. However, Nazi intelligence believes that the find may be just too good to be true -- and a desperate cat-and-mouse game begins in the heart of war torn London...\n\nStarring:\nRobert Flemyng\nClifton Webb\nGloria Grahame\n\nDirector: Ronald Neame\n\nAvailable on BluRay from http://www.odeonent.co.uk/product/the-man-who-never-was",

At a talent competition, they are discovered by an ambitious manager named Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx), who offers them the opportunity of a lifetime: to become the back-up singers for headliner James \"Thunder\" Early (Eddie Murphy). Curtis gradually takes control of the girls' look and sound, eventually giving them their own shot in the spotlight as The Dreams. That spotlight, however, begins to narrow in on Deena, finally pushing the less attractive Effie out altogether. Though the Dreams become a crossover phenomenon, they soon realize that the cost of fame and fortune may be higher than they ever imagined.\n\nRounding out the main cast are Keith Robinson (\"Fat Albert\"), Sharon Leal (TV's \"Boston Public\"), and three-time Tony Award winner Hinton Battle (\"Miss Saigon,\" \"The Tap Dance Kid,\" \"The Wiz\").\n\n\"Dreamgirls\" is being directed by Bill Condon from a screenplay he adapted from the stage musical's original book by Tom Eyen. An Academy Award\u00ae winner for his screenplay for \"Gods and Monsters,\" which he also directed, Condon received another Oscar\u00ae nomination for his screenplay adaptation of \"Chicago.\" He more recently wrote and directed \"Kinsey.\"\n\nAcademy Award\u00ae-nominated producer Laurence Mark (\"Jerry Maguire,\" \"As Good As It Gets,\" \"I, Robot\") is producing \"Dreamgirls,\" with Patricia Whitcher (\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\" \"The Terminal\") executive producing. The lyrics are by Tom Eyen, with music by Henry Krieger.\n\nCast: Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover, Anika Noni Rose, Jennifer Hudson, Keith Robinson, Bobby Slayton\n\nStudio: DreamWorks Pictures (Paramount)\nDirector: Bill Condon\nScreenwriter: Bill Condon\nGenre: Drama, Musical\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.dreamworks.com/dreamgirls",

Now, I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t kids who do turn around, but some just will never get motivated about education, and I don&#39;t like how they blame the school system for that, and really, would a 9th grade English teacher really be racist?",

Told in flashback as the artist (Nigel Terry - Troy) lies dying in poverty, the film brilliantly recreates the look and colour of Caravaggio's original paintings while exploring the homoerotic subtext of his work. Speculating on the artist's relationship with his model Ranuccio (Sean Bean - Lord of the Rings), the film explores a vicious love triangle also involving the model's wife, played brilliantly by Tilda Swinton (Orlando, Michael Clayton) Jarman's muse and collaborator throughout several films, this was Swinton's first feature role. With luscious production design it was the first major film production for award-winning costume designer Sandy Powell (The Aviator, Skakespeare in Love) the dazzling Caravaggio is arguably the most accessible of Jarman's films.",

Here he plays an innocent abroad, one who is befelled by nothing but misery, bad luck and misfortune. He then decides to turn to the dark side, where he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams.",

Therefore the Imperial Japanese Army is desperate to prevent it from falling into American hands and providing a launching point for an invasion of Japan. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi is given command of the forces on the island and sets out to prepare for the imminent attack. General Kuribayashi, however, does not favor the rigid traditional approach recommended by his subordinates, and resentment and resistance fester among his staff. In the lower echelons, a young soldier, Saigo, a poor baker in civilian life, strives with his friends to survive the harsh regime of the Japanese army itself, all the while knowing that a fierce battle looms. When the American invasion begins, both Kuribayashi and Saigo find strength, honor, courage, and horrors beyond imagination.",

Whether swinging a hot number with Bob Crosby's orchestra or emoting a hilariously hammy version of Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene, Judy is a delight as a stage-struck Hoosier in this charming film based on Booth Tarkington's novel. Lily just knows she has the talent to light up the Great White Way, so when a big Broadway producer (Van Heflin) visits her hometown, she expends all the candlepower of her charisma to impress him. He's not impressed. He heads back to New York and Lily follows, thumbing her way east on what she's sure is a one-way trip to instant stardom. At a mere 20 years old, Judy had already reached stardom. Presenting Lily Mars proves why, showcasing her once-in-a-generation voice, gift for comedy and enduring movie magnetism. Break a leg, Lily! #Trailer #WB",

Dismembered corpses are being found in garbage bags around Seoul. However, the surgically amputated arms, legs and heads are mismatched, rendering the victims nearly impossibly to identify. When Cho discovers that all the victims were once romantically involved with the same woman, Suyeon Chae (Shim Eun-ha) becomes the focal point of the investigation. Growing more suspicious of Suyeon, even as he becomes more entranced by her icy charm, Cho realizes that the secret to the horrifying murders lies in the carefully guarded memories of her past.",

Last night was my 4th viewing at home, so next time I&#39;ll cut off the English subtitles as I know the story so well.

            "Is anyone reading this afraid of Death? Well it\u2019s a pretty scary thing huh. Do you know what death is? According to the Bible, death is wages. \u201cThe Wages of Sin is death...\u201d (Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrsby9nAIVg&amp;t=383\">6:23</a>). So death is wages, We earn it by sinning. The Bible says that \u201cAll have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God.\u201d (Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrsby9nAIVg&amp;t=203\">3:23</a>). So if you have sinned, you\u2019ve earned your wages, death. You may think your a good person, so if you died you would go to heaven because you are good, well... The Bible says that God alone is good. Look, if you have told a lie, or many lies, you are technically a liar. If you have stolen anything, you are a thief. If you have ever blasphemed God, by saying his name in vain (omg) than you are a blasphemer. And Jesus said if you look at a woman to lust after her you commit adultery with her in your heart, (Pornography, or just looking at someone with sexual intentions, and wanting them). If you have done all 4 of these things, you are a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart. So when God judges you when you die, which he will, would you go to heaven or hell according to your works? Because of your sin, you would go to hell. We deserve it, and God is a just judge, and he will judge according to our works. That\u2019s bad news huh... But, I have some VERY good news! God did something for guilty sinners, deserving of hell, do you know what he did? He came down from heaven, in the form of a man, named Jesus of Nazareth. And Jesus lived the perfect life that you and I never could, he fulfilled the Law, and was perfect and blameless, and he went and laid down his life for you and me. He went and died on a cross and shed his innocent blood so that you and I, sinners, could be forgiven. And after he died, he rose from the dead, 3 days later. Jesus Christ paid the debt that you and I couldn\u2019t pay. He was the perfect sacrifice, he is the Lamb of God, who was slaughtered for us! He laid down his life for us, So we could have eternal life through him! So please I beg you, the only way to go to heaven is through Jesus! \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever Believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrsby9nAIVg&amp;t=196\">3:16</a>). The Bible says that If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and Believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved.  (Romans 10:9, ESV Version)So please, acknowledge that you are a sinner, and that you deserve Hell, and please turn to Jesus and cry out to God for forgiveness! Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and Thou Shalt be Saved! Trust in Jesus\u2019s work on the cross, and what he did for you ALONE and you will Go to heaven! Don\u2019t trust in your goodness, because as I said, no one is good but God. Salvation is the Gift of God! Please recieve it today, you never know when it will be too late! And please read your bible to strengthen your walk with Christ, and to get to know him better. If u haven\u2019t read the Bible, maybe start in John, or Genesis, or wherever. Christ is coming back, be ready. God bless, have a good day, and please anyone who\u2019s reading this think about this, your eternity is at stake! God bless. \u2764\ufe0f \u201cVerily verily I say unto you, He that beliveth on me hath everlasting life.\u201d Please read your bible, if you don\u2019t have one, get the You-Version app. Ask God to reveal himself to you, if he hasn\u2019t already! Also Have a good day, God loves you, and if you haven\u2019t already in your life, he is waiting for you to turn to him and recieve the Gift he has for you, which is Everlasting life through Christ Jesus our Lord. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude01\u271d\ufe0f",

There isn&#39;t really any depth to these characters though some of them might be entertaining to watch too bad those ones die pretty early on.  okay so the ending is a little twist here after one person wins the money they apparently have to walk into another house with other people who have won the money and by my guess kill each other again, kinda neat but Honestly not worth your time. <br><br><br>Characters<br>police guy: he is a policeman and is trying to keep everyone alive may be a bit prejudice towards black people but not overtly<br>Main girl: she cries, she yells, she stares, she occasionally speaks and she wins<br>pretty british girl: she is pretty and british and is very high maintenance <br>irish bad girl: she is the bad girl, been to jail, don&#39;t like pretty british girl<br>french dude: shady frenchman, don&#39;t trust him, treats wife like shit<br>other guy: he just tries to survive and also speaks french(honestly kinda funny)<br>french dudes wife: is treated like shit, seduced by BBC<br>priest: holy man, don&#39;t like violence, Prays <br>Token Black guy: He&#39;s angry, he&#39;s a rapper, he tries to fuck, he dislikes white people especially police officers",

I do enjoy these trapped in house or small places horror films. this one was similar to the rest but still was very entertaining. I loved Dennis Hopper&#39;s character he did a great job playing the priest and so did Kelly Brook who played Lea, and Hippolyte Girardot who played Francis and Raffaello Degrutolla who played Jay, everyone was great. Spoiler:  I kind of knew that Francis was the one to go nuts. the movie was very enjoyable. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do, P.S.

In 1984, German filmmaker Philip Gr\u00f6ning wrote to the Carthusian order for permission to make a documentary about them. They said they would get back to him. Sixteen years later, they were ready. Gr\u00f6ning, sans crew or artificial lighting, lived in the monks' quarters for six months\u2014filming their daily prayers, tasks, rituals and rare outdoor excursions. This transcendent, closely observed film seeks to embody a monastery, rather than simply depict one\u2014it has no score, no voiceover and no archival footage. What remains is stunningly elemental: time, space and light. One of the most mesmerizing and poetic chronicles of spirituality ever created, INTO GREAT SILENCE dissolves the border between screen and audience with a total immersion into the hush of monastic life. More meditation than documentary, it's a rare, transformative theatrical experience for all.\r\n\r\nOPENS FEBRUARY 28",

I considered myself rather religious when i first saw this a few years back.  I found it boring, tedious and couldn&#39;t even finish it. It is not the life you live that determines  what you will do for God, but what God does in your life that determines what you decide to do. You have atheists on here who enjoyed the film.....

And of a woman, Empress Carlota (Bette Davis), driven to madness. John Garfield and Gale Sondergaard join the illustrious cast of this epic, directed by William Dieterle (A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Life of Emile Zola) and set against a backdrop of revolution and royal ambition, with Mexico as the prize. All the leads earned critical plaudits, but many reviewers singled out Davis for one bravura sequence in which, as the mentally fragile Empress, she confronts Napoleon, demanding he save her husband's life. \"Her final flitting away into the darkness of madness is the most unforgettable moment in the picture\" (James Shelley Hamilton, National Board of Review). #Trailer #WB",

            "Aww. This is the saddest movie I&#39;ve ever seen, but no one else seems to see it like I do... I bawled last time I saw it. I see it as various aspects of a girl&#39;s psyche burning away through grief, until only Gorgeous (the driving force of John B. Calhoun&#39;s &quot;beautiful ones&quot;) remains, as she resigns herself to a life alone like her aunt&#39;s. It is a perfect elaboration of the coming-of-age of a hikikomori, told so symbolically everyone seems to miss it and just see it as hilarious. Well, let me give you one more secret: when the &quot;knight in shining armor&quot; character and the other man disappear and are replaced by bananas (phallic fruit [a double symbol for homosexuality]) it represents the girl (whose 7 aspects of personality are represented by 7 girls [Hausu is ultimately most similar to Pixar&#39;s 2015 film Inside Out!]) blaming her fantasy man for not scooping her up because he&#39;s turned gay.",

That Korean Squad Leader is very smart. He knew what he was dealing with is not from this world. He don&#39;t get panic he just thinks as dealing with an unknown entity (hostile). I really love that. This Korean movie also tells about parrel space like that area appeared to have non-euclidean geometry that extends the building to an unknown degree. They just met US army force. And a few moments later they found as dead for years old. It explains a lot.  This movie is about ghost and parrel space and timely intervention. I had a look at the Korean website that there was actually note found written by a dead French soldier in that area. That really shocked me. This movie story might be based on what really happened?

Love interest could have been so much more and just wasn&#39;t, nice, cute guy, and that&#39;s it.<br>Even Teen Wolf the series did it better ideally, and their main character is a shallow boy who wouldn&#39;t be able to see other people besides his girlfriend if they were two inches from his nose.

Then again, Thomas Harris probably intended to murder the franchise, since he didn&#39;t write this book nor the movie voluntarily; he felt obliged and forced by a threat, &quot;If you don&#39;t write this story, we&#39;ll find someone else to do it.&quot; Look it up, it&#39;s all true.

Despite his round head, Oblio has many friends. But an evil count, jealous that Oblio is more popular than his own son, says that without a pointed head, Oblio is an outlaw. Along with his faithful dog Arrow, Oblio is exiled to the Pointless Forest. There, he has many fantastic experiences (including encounters with a 3-headed man, giant bees, a tree in the leaf-selling business, and a good-humored old rock). From his adventures, Oblio learns that it is not at all necessary to be pointed to have a point in life. Music composed and performed by Harry Nilsson (\"Me and My Arrow\"), who also wrote the story. Ringo Starr narrates.",

After years of dedicated service, veteran detective Chan (Simon Yam) finally puts him behind bars. However, on the eve of his trial, Po orchestrates the execution of the prosecuting attorney from his jail-cell, and walks away as a free man.\r\n\r\nHaving been diagnosed with terminal cancer, Chan persuades his men to take the law into their own hands in a last desperate attempt to bring their arch-nemesis to justice. Ma Kwun (Donnie Yen), a detective inspector with a hard-as-nails reputation, begins to uncover their illegal methods and a bloody confrontation ensues. However, when Po's most deadly assassin (Wu Jing) begins to dispatch Chan's team with lethal efficiency, he is compelled to join forces with Ma to take down the greatest criminal empire of their generation.\r\n\r\nCulminating in the long-awaited showdown between action legends Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen, Kill Zone combines knife-edge suspense and electrifying full-contact fight sequences to deliver a thrill-a-minute spectacular that's in a class of its own!",

(He included Rex Reed&#39;s pan, which didn&#39;t make things easier for Reed...)<br>Gore Vidal made two attempts to adapt his own book, but producer Richard Zanuck rejected both scripts as not outrageous enough!",

            "The real reason for its utter failure is that half the book never makes it to the film,  no it was not cut, it just never made it to the script.  There were copyright issues, and a very reasonable refusal by all of the studios to assist in making this by allowing ANY of their film segments to be included in this film.  Sarne was powerless with so many big names on the cast each with their own major peculiarities<br><br><br>The making of this film failed from the very beginning and never had the slightest chance.  As a book it works fine and Gore Vidal got his humorous bite on Hollywood full scale.  But Hollywood would/could never accept this plot line and action since it is so incredibly anti-Hollywood.<br><br><br>When you compare the raw talent of those who participated, and the internationally recognized author  you might think it was a sure thing.  But the resulting film belied that potential.  When comparing this film to others with 10% of this film&#39;s budget which ultimately had little chance versus the potential this film squandered it makes this  a natural for worst film ever.",

For real ,no horror movie on this planet,  that at least I ever saw has ever reached this type of atmosphere of pure evil and fear. When Jack Palance walks through this old dark alley\u00b4s you think he walks through pure hell and everything evil can happen at any time. LOL As a child I thought to myself that if I had lived in this old England on one of those side streets in the 18th century I would never have opened the door for fear of being killed if I walked out for a second in the dark.

It was scary and a bit edgy for tv back then - the bleeding and the brutal beatings and stabbings. It was referred to as, &quot;Ornate Horror,&quot; by a film critic, likely because of the atmospheric sets and curious camera work. <br>And, it was shot on some high-quality tape that gives it a, &quot;Live,&quot; appearance.<br>Put these features together, place a dynamic and powerful actor like Jack Palance in the middle of it, and add Composer, Cobert&#39;s, eerie, dramatic Dark Shadows music (fuller orchestral sound in this movie, though) and you have an unbeatable piece of work.

Plus it was sooo corny and there wasn&#39;t much actual action for such a dark character. it was cool when i was 12 but now it kinda sucks, and the only part i like now is the 1st transformation that was cool.",

            "This is an enjoyable, good movie, particularly for those who like psychological drama, because by nature it is. It is a credit to Ryan Phillippe, that in spite of his young age, he was an equal to veteran actor Chris Cooper&#39;s rock solid performance.  One of the commenter mentioned already, that at the final count, it was a sad movie, which IMO is correct.  What I mean, that at the end when the final resolution happens,  you don&#39;t feel elated, smirky or in a congratulatory mood. Henry the Fifth timeless words rings in my ear from W. Shakespeare&#39;s drama where the king thus ends his speech to the three uncovered traitors among his noble entourage: <br>&quot; I will weep for thee;<br>  For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like,<br>  Another fall of man.&quot;",

Problem: Alex can say it with music, but he sure can't say it with words. Enter Sophie Fisher (DREW BARRYMORE), his beguiling if quirky plant lady, who has a green thumb for lyrics. Together, they go after songwriting success -- and discover that if you want to write the perfect love song, it helps to fall in love.\r\n\r\nWith Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore at the keyboard and Marc Lawrence (Two Weeks Notice) directing, Music and Lyrics is a witty, wacky romantic comedy that faces the music...and laughs! #Trailer #WB",
