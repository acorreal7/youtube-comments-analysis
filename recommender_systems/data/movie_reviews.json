[["This movie came out when I was three. Now I'm twenty seven and the goddamn thing still holds up.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._", "Decided to revisit this after many years and still holds up so well. Great movie for both kids and adults with wonderful teachable moments. Just a groundbreaking animated movie all around. **4.5/5**", "A stunning feature film entrance from Pixar! <em>'Toy Story'</em> is a true delight, from the first second to the last.\r\n\r\nThe CGI animation is excellent. All the toys look brilliant, as does the world itself - I love the feel of it. The music is very good, Randy Newman does a nice job - \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" is a cracker.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks leads a strong cast. Hanks plays Woody, to fantastic effect. He is the best part of this film. Tim Allen is great, too, as Buzz Lightyear. Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head), Wallace Shawn (Rex) and John Ratzenberger (Hamm) also bring fun.\r\n\r\nEverything else is just as terrific: the humour, the pacing, the plot - I enjoy it all. There are probably some flaws in parts, namely Buzz's supposed unawareness, but nothing impacts the viewing experience. Go watch!", "Every now and again when you watch antiques programmes on television and somebody turns up with a toy in it's original box - that turns out to be worth more than his car - I regret that I no longer possess any from my childhood. I do recall, however, being especially fickle - the favourite one day was never likely to reign long before being supplanted by another. That's the case here for cowboy \"Woody\". He is the favourite of owner \"Andy\" amongst, it has to be said, rather a lot of different ones. Until, that is - one birthday, we meet Space Ranger \"Buzz Lightyear\". He's actually quite an affable chap, but the green eyed monster is now in charge and \"Woody\" tries to relegate his successor down the side of the bed. That goes wrong and, accidentally, out of the window he goes. The other toys are horrified, leaving \"Woody\" with no option but to get over his laser envy, rescue his new rival and repatriate him before the whole family move to a new home! What now ensues are some fun escapades, near misses and they fall into the hands of another young boy who really does want to blast \"Buzz\" into space. The vocal talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are enthusiastic and entertaining, those of Don Rickles (\"Mr. Potato Head\") sometimes a little nearer the bone for the grown ups and they are all helped along by a good soundtrack and a wittily written script offering us plenty of scenarios that draw the viewer (of whatever age) into this simple, pretty timeless story. It's interesting, for 1995, to note the wide variety of toys this young boy has, too - no gender stereotyping, which is quite refreshing. This is quickly paced and enjoyable animation that touches on the values of trust, companionship and team spirt - as well as the demerits of envy and selfishness - and I really enjoyed it."], ["Really solid entry into the series with Brosnan, who is personally my favorite Bond, is great. The plot is on the thin side but is helped having Sean Bean as the sinister villain and of course Famke Janssen makes for an amazingly sexy psychopath with, ahem, incredible thighs. **4.0/5**", "_**The Russia installment, plus Pierce Brosnan\u2019s debut**_\r\n\r\nAgent 007 (Pierce Brosnan) returns to Russia to investigate the theft of a space-based electromagnetic pulse weapon, which destroyed a radar facility in Siberia with only one survivor (Izabella Scorupco). Sean Bean plays an MI6 agent, Famke Janssen a ruthless assassin, Gottfried John a Russian commander, Joe Don Baker a CIA contact in St. Petersburg and Judi Dench the new \u2018M.\u2019\r\n\r\n\"Goldeneye\" (1995) introduces Brosnan for his four-film stint in the series and he does a fine job as James Bond. Some people write him off as a \u201cpretty boy\u201d but, while he\u2019s a handsome man, he\u2019s also masculine and kick-axx. He\u2019s perfect for the role.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot is overly convoluted, the flick delivers the goods. The action highlights include the opening Russian dam sequence, a car chase in Monaco, the theft of an attack helicopter in Monte Carlo, a wild tank chase in St. Petersburg and the action-packed close in the jungles of Cuba with the secret lair thereof. \r\n\r\nIzabella Scorupco is gorgeous in a winsome way and more shoulda been done with her. Meanwhile sharp Famke is perhaps the most sadistic biyatch in the series.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 9 minutes, and was shot in Switzerland (chemical weapons facility); Monte Carlo (casino) & nearby Alpes-Maritimes, France (car chase); England; St. Petersburg, Russia; and Puerto Rico (Goldeneye Satellite Dish & beach scene).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "**Goldeneye is the gold standard of spy movies and Bond films.**\r\n\r\nGoldeneye edges out Casino Royale and Skyfall as my favorite Bond film of all time. After decades of campy James Bond movies like Octopussy and A View to a Kill, Bond felt more like a punchline than a suave master spy. The franchise seemed to have lost its way, but Goldeneye brought gritty action, mind-blowing stunts, beautiful and capable Bind girls, and an outstanding cast back to Bond, returning the spy to his iconic and sterling reputation. Pierce Brosnan's Bond convincingly outwitted criminal masterminds and decisively overcame enemy opposition with precision and brutality while also believably charming and romancing beautiful villains and allies. Goldeneye nails every classic Bond element with more tenacity and realism. 006 betraying his country and becoming the evil mirror to 007 provides a deeper antagonist than Bond typically faces. The Bond girls are not helpless damsels but capable enemies or skilled partners that help him save the day. The action set pieces are astonishing, from driving a tank through the busy city streets of St Petersburg to dangling hundreds of feet above the ground in Costa Rice to the incredible base jump in the opening sequence. Even after all these years, Goldneye's effects and action still hold up. It is also the first movie with Judi Dench as M. Goldeneye is quintessential Bond at its absolute best!", "Well, it was nice to see Bond back on the screen, and just in time for me to get my Drivers License, so this isn't the 1st 007 film I ever saw on the big screen, but it's the first that I got to drive myself to.\r\n\r\nAnd I remember that the media kept asking \"who will be 007's villain now that the USSR has fallen?\" By then I had seen all the Bond films to date, by then I was a 007 fanatic, and that is when I first realized that the media really has the memory of a Goldfish... a lesson that would serve me well later in life and still does to this day.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it was pretty classy fun how you only got glimpses of Brosnan for the first few moments of the introduction... it WOULD have been better if, you know, the entire world didn't know he was 007 already, but I guess it was a happy surprise for the few people that were living under a rock for the year or so leading up to the film's release. The few people that missed all of the nonstop hype.\r\n\r\nTina Turner did one of the better 007 songs, Brosnan had a heck of a showing as 007... Onatop was probably the last of the 007 suggestive name tropes to make an appearance in film (unless you count Christmas who was only named so for a closing joke), and for the most part it was a great showing.\r\n\r\nI mean, the tank chase alone should sell you on it. As should 006.\r\n\r\nBut, at the end, it was just a competent and decent showing that is beloved primarily because of relief. Relief that Brosnan was 007, relief that they were making 007 movies again, relief that some fun was brought back to the world.", "This 007 movie begins with Bond and a fellow agent performing heroics, and the other agent is killed.\r\nHowever, even when this movie was made, it is quite obvious that the other agent wasn't killed, and that he is actually the villain. That isn't even a spoiler. \r\nBond deals with Russians mostly here. Not surprisingly, any good Russian becomes a dead Russian with the immortal godlike villain at work.\r\nOne saving grace is a bit of dark humor with a computer nerd at the end.\r\nThat's about it. Otherwise, it's just another depressing Hollywood formula movie, the usual \"darkest before the Dawn\" that just goes overboard and gets too self indulgent and too contrived every step of the way.", "This actually starts out quite promisingly with a double-hander between Pierce Brosnan's \"007\" and his colleague \"006/Alec\" (Sean Bean) having a battle royal then a rogue general pinching the controls for a deadly satellites system - and that's pretty much all before Tina Turner gets her lungs around the theme song. Then, sadly it sinks into a really procedural action drama with some really mediocre writing and as B-level a cast as I've seen for ages. You could see the obvious twist in the plot from the satellite in orbit above, Joe Don Baker's megalomaniac arms dealing \"Wade\" is almost as comical as Robbie Coltrane's Russian gangster \"Zukovsky\" who is in turn almost as bad as Alan Cumming's even more thickly accented geek \"Grishenko\". Dame Judi had the sense to say in London for most of this and so out of harm's way as the denouement lurched into view. There's a nod to the Ian Fleming humour, I suppose, with this one's \"Bond\" girl being \"Xenia Onatopp\" (the entirely unconvincing Famke Janssen) but I'm afraid I just lost interest. It's hard to keep reinventing the franchise and to be original - but if it's going to be this hard, then maybe just stop?"], [], ["I know that no movie is perfect but for my money Get Shorty is on my short list of films that come close. As good as the book is, I believe the movie improved upon it.  I have watched it a few times, it being one of those movies we might invite a friend over to watch who hasn\u2019t seen it. Plus it has surfaced a few times when I surf streaming channels and I usually stop to watch for a while, no matter where in the film I am.\r\n\r\nThe ensemble cast (which includes a few lower echelon stars) is excellent and mostly look like they are having fun with it. There is violence, but not with buckets of blood. It almost seems like cartoonish violence. And of course wit and humor run through it, with a bit of satire on Hollywood thrown in.\r\n\r\nI just found out today that a sequel was made called Be Cool and a British tv series based on the book, but I like this one so much I won't even risk disappointment by watching those other entries.", "You know what, I really love Elmore Leonard, and a part of me feels that nearly any movie made from his works is going to come out as fresh, original, and worth watching.\r\n\r\nThis is the rare exception.\r\n\r\nHere they took a classic Elmore Leonard plot and made it too Hollywood for its own good. And then they tried a bit hard to make it too much like a Pulp Fiction film, but with less bleak comedy and more slapstick comedy.\r\n\r\nYou still have Leonard's unique originality...but the story has been raped and what's left is trash.", "Mobster \"Chilli Palmer\" (John Travolta) finds himself a bit exposed when his benefactor boss has an heart attack on his sixty-fifth birthday. Luckily for him, his new nemesis \"Bones\" still has an use for him - go to Hollywood and collect some gambling debts from \"Harry\" (Gene Hackman). This fellow produces the kind of horror films that would have made Roger Corman blush, but he's a bit smarter than the average bear so is soon trying to manoeuvre his new friend into a career in the movies. Not acting in them, but producing them - and suddenly \"Chilli\" realises that he already has quite a few of the skills necessary to coax, cajole and plain old extort from just about everyone to fund a vehicle for \"Karen\" (Rene Russo). They use established star \"Weir\" (Danny DeVito) as a consultant and try to con the dapper drug-peddling \"Catlett\" (Delroy Lindo) out of half a million dollars to pay the bills - well someone's bills. Travolta is on good form here with a tongue in cheek, less-is-more, style of delivery but it's really Hackman who steals the show. His sharp and opportunistic character pokes fun at the film industry from funding to casting to filming in quite an entertaining fashion, and Russo complements well as the high maintenance woman who used to date \"Weir\". Who hasn't dated who in this town? The joke does wear a bit thin after a while, but for the most part it's a charismatic affair with a cast gelling well to deliver this amiable adaptation of the Elmore Leonard send up of the mob and the movies. It's dated a bit, but still worth a watch."], ["Sigourney Weaver is \"Helen\", a psychologist who has a major panic attack if she has to leave her apartment to fetch a newspaper from the corridor outside! She is, however an expert on what drives serial killers - having had a pretty near death experience with one earlier in her career - Harry Connick Jnr, no less. When a copycat starts to kill young women, she is drafted in by police officers \"Monahan\" (Holly Hunter) and her partner \"Goetz\" (Dermot Mulroney) and together they have to track down this masochistic individual before he strikes again. To make things more interesting, the killer starts to get in touch with them, to tease and goad them - he even gives them a name - but can they apprehend him before his spree continues unabated? It's an OK crime drama this, no better really. The cast work well enough, but the plot is riddled with holes that rather rob the thing of much jeopardy and provide for an ending that you can see from space. Sigourney Weaver does enough, and Hunter makes for quite a feisty and determined cop but the pace of this overlong feature is lethargic at best, with too many distractions in the story that render much of this quite tedious at times. Perhaps, had Jon Amiel tightened up the script a bit and cut out some of the unnecessary character development stuff, we might have been left with a more potent catch-me-if-you-can. As it is though, this is all pretty unremarkable."], [], ["Really good sci-fi thriller with wonderful performances by Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe and Brad Pitt. Really well done by director Terry Gilliam that has great pacing through the two hour running time. **4.0/5**", "**_A-man-comes-back-from-the-future Sci-Fi with Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt_**\r\n\r\nIn 2035 survivors are living underground after a viral outbreak has wiped out most of the populace. A prisoner (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to obtain the original virus so scientists can find a cure. Madeleine Stowe, Brad Pitt, Christopher Plummer and David Morse are on hand in key roles.\r\n\r\n\"12 Monkeys\" (1996) has a huge reputation as a sci-fi thriller and is iconic of 90\u2019s cinema. The man coming back from the future plot immediately brings to mind the first two Terminator flicks (from 1984 and 1991), but \u201c12 Monkeys\u201d pales by comparison.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s worth seeing and is entertaining enough with Madeleine Stowe shining, but the story is hampered by a muddled tone of schizophrenia and the unrelenting grunginess of the visual aesthetic (which makes perfect sense for 2035, but not for 1990 and 1996 where most of the events take place). In short, the movie\u2019s just not as compelling as it could be.\r\n\r\nPeople gush over Brad Pitt\u2019s role and he is entertaining, but it\u2019s a glaring rip-off of Dennis Hopper\u2019s photojournalist in \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d (1979), although I suppose you could see it as an homage. In any case, I could see through Pitt\u2019s acting here and there whereas Hopper was the real deal, perhaps because he & crew were literally stuck in the sweltering jungle waiting around for days doing drugs or whatever while Coppola & Brando worked out the kinks in the script for the last act.\r\n\r\nIf I'm in the mood for this kind of fare, the first three Terminator flicks are a superior option and even the remake of \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (2008). This one's decent, but overrated.\r\n   \r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 9 minutes, and was shot primarily in the Philadelphia & Baltimore areas. For instance, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia was used for the rundown asylum.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "**An excellent sci-fi film that deserves our attention.**\r\n\r\nI didn't really know what to expect when this movie was on TV very recently, but I was really glued to the set until the end thanks to a truly absorbing story and a collection of great actors who do a great job. I don't know director Terry Gilliam very well, I've only seen one or two of his films so far (not counting this film), but I'm beginning to understand his aesthetic a bit. However, I recognize that surrealism, of which the director is adept, and the bizarre script can really make it difficult to understand the work.\r\n\r\nThe film begins by immersing us in a profoundly dystopian world, where humanity was almost extinct by a pandemic. As the disease comes from an airborne virus that was deliberately released, the survivors moved into underground shelters. Technology, however, has evolved and allows the sending of chrononauts (that is, time travelers) to the past, in order to obtain pure samples of the virus, which can be used in the manufacture of a vaccine or medicine.\r\n\r\nThis is how James Cole, a criminal, is chosen for time travel in exchange for his crimes being forgiven. His mission is not to alter the past by preventing the release of the virus, even if he seems to want to. The mission is to locate those responsible and pass on all the information to the future, in order to send another agent who will collect the samples. But he only knows that a radicalized environmentalist group, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, was responsible. Sent by accident to 1990 (instead of 1996), he ends up in an insane asylum where he will befriend the manic Jeffrey Goines and endear Dr. Railly.\r\n\r\nThe film deals with very complex themes, such as time travel, temporal paradoxes, the impossibility of changing the past, and even madness, the tenuous difference between reality and imagination, or between sanity and insanity. It has several advances and retreats in time and you have to be attentive, but what intrigues viewers the most is its ending, strangely sudden and confusing. I understood it quite well, and I think you just need to pay attention to the film to understand everything, but I'll leave a clue to help: the eyes of the protagonist and the eyes of the child that we see at the end of the film are exactly the same, and the what she sees coincides perfectly with a recurring dream that torments the protagonist, coming from the future. I say no more.\r\n\r\nI loved Brad Pitt's performance in this movie. The actor, very used to heartthrob roles where he can use and abuse his natural charm, is almost unrecognizable here. Of course, younger and less experienced, but just as impeccable. I don't know to what extent participating in this film had an influence on his learning as an actor, but I believe it was useful for Pitt. Bruce Willis is also an actor who deserves a positive mention for his work here. He really seems confused, and in many scenes he manages to give the character the feeling that she is abandoning herself to the course of events, fighting against it whenever she feels her mission is in danger. Madeleine Stowe's performance was not so happy: while being frankly positive, it is the least interesting and the most conventional.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is flawless. Gilliam cleverly takes advantage of the sets and costumes and makes a truly strange, bizarre future, with those plastic protective suits and that ball in the interrogation scenes. It's an ugly world that we don't want to see one day. I especially liked the cinematography, and the way the director works the footage in a way that makes everything even more surreal and strange. For example, the scene on the staircase of Goines' father's mansion, which is as elegant and majestic as it is labyrinthine and dreamlike. In addition to the good effects, the film also has a very effective soundtrack.", "Bruce Willis is at the height of his game here as his \"Cole\" character is sent back in time to find out just how the world came to suffer from a virus that all but wiped out humanity. He is promised early release from his extended prison sentence if he can glean enough information and get back alive to share it! Thing is, they put him back a bit too early and his harbingering of doom stuff merely serves to find him sectioned and under the care of scientist \"Railly\" (Madeleine Stowe) and friends with the off-his-trolley \"Goines\" (Brad Pitt) who might just have an use when it comes to fulfilling their quest. \"Railly\" doesn't exactly volunteer to help him out, but quickly she and \"Cole\" are onto a group called the \"Army of the Twelve Monkeys\" believing that they might hold some of the clues to this man-made misery in waiting. It's a Terry Gilliam film so the plot is never going to stick to just the one dimension. Accordingly, \"Cole\" starts to lose his grasp on reality - he hallucinates, hears voices and generally begins to wonder if he is going mad. Maybe it's the effects of time travel? Maybe something more sinister is afoot? Willis and Stowe are on good form but it's actually Pitt who plays the role of the bonkers \"Goines\" more memorably. You just know that his character has more to it than the vacillatingly unhinged man presented in the hospital, and as the adventure develops these three characters present us with a quickly paced story that mixes the future with the past whilst peppering the whole thing with questions about the morality of vivisection, scientific experimentation and unfettered technological advances. Why would anyone want to create a virus this potent and irreversible anyway? That's the question."], ["Truly disgusting type of entertainment that inspires vegetarianism! It also has a scene too much to be in a children\u2019s film that reflects on domestic violence (between two dogs). The producers who made this sort of junk were obviously nuts in the head to put such a scene like this into such family oriented film. Please do not watch after seeing this review. You do not especially want to get inspired by such propaganda about using certain animals as food.", "**Absolutely wonderful, and suitable for the whole family.**\r\n\r\nUsually, people look at this movie as just another movie for kids. This is not my opinion. It is true that it is a fantasy film, with animals that talk and have human postures and behavior. However, it was built and developed in a way that turns out to be very pleasing to adults as well. Perfect to be seen with the whole family, it is a regular presence on television, especially during Christmas.\r\n\r\nThe script couldn't be more delicious: Babe is a baby piglet who, on his lucky day, was taken from the slaughterhouse where he would inevitably die (as happened to his parents and siblings). The little pig ends up in the hands of the owner of a sheep farm, who thought of fattening him up with the intention of killing him. However, and through a series of funny adventures, the little pig turns out to reveal a special talent for helping to herd the sheep, which will put the natural position of the animals and the reputation of the sheepdogs in the spotlight. Through this story, the film approaches, with humor and feeling, serious questions such as the meaning of life, death, the place of each one in the world, evil, reward and punishment.\r\n\r\nMaking this film as an animation, traditional or computerized, would have been easy. However, the production made the film with real animals and used technology to perfect the material and file rough edges. At the time, the film received some harsh criticism for making strong insinuations about meat consumption (after all, we are not used to seeing our lunch speak to other animals about the nobility of the food purpose for which it was created), and the truth is that it seems that there were really people to stop eating meat because of this.\r\n\r\nIf animals are the main protagonists of this film, where do humans come in? It's not the protagonism, I believe, that changes things a lot. The main human role in this film goes to James Cromwell, an extremely competent and talented actor who had no difficulty with his character, the owner of the farm where Babe will live, and who understands how special his piggy is. And despite speaking little, the way the actor communicates with his body and face is excellent. Magda Szubanski also does a good job, and it's interesting to see how the actress has aged so that she can play the character, which is a woman much older than the actress.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is exquisite and achieves some feats worthy of mention. To begin with, the number of animals, trainers and handlers that were used in the film is extraordinary. The logistical effort alone must have been enormous, in order to guarantee not only continuity (they could not all be different animals) but the hygiene and health of the animals. The make-up department, with her work, not only aged Szubanski but she humanized some of the animals, which is no small feat. The film has excellent sets and props, recreating well the childhood imagination and the idyllic bucolic rural life, very different from the life of hard work in the countryside. But what delights and surprises us most is the extraordinary cinematography, with vibrant colors, high contrast and radiant beauty. Although I'm not particularly a fan of mice, they serve their purpose. As for the soundtrack, it is solidly based on pieces from the classical repertoire such as the waltz \u201cThe Blue Danube\u201d, by Johann Strauss II, \u201cCantique de Jean Racine\u201d from Gabriel Faur\u00e9's Requiem and, particularly, the adaptation of the most famous chords of the last movement. from Symphony No. 3 Op. 78 for Pipe Organ and Orchestra by Camille Saint-Saenz. It is a piece that seems to have been chosen at random, but that may be explained by the fact that the composer is also the author of the famous work \u201cCarnival of the Animals\u201d, which could very well be here."], ["This is a terrific movie, with dramatic power and a balanced look at the issue of capital punishment. It is based on a true story written and lived by a nun, Sister Helen Prejean though, as usually happens, the story is modified to fit the needs of a dramatic movie. For example, the two inmates she provided spiritual advice to are merged into one for this film. As a side note, Sister Prejean has an uncredited appearance in a scene concerning a vigil.\r\n\r\nThe movie is gritty at times,but always watchable. Susan Surandon received an academy award for her performance.\r\n\r\nIn addition to it being a great movie, there are two soundtrack albums of note. The first is the soundtrack, featuring an array of songs by Springsteen, Johnny Cash and others. Also there is a movie score version, with music of a more atmospheric nature. I use it to read or write fiction to sometimes.", "**A very human film that is solidly based on the performance of the two main actors and on the discussion around the death penalty.**\r\n\r\nThere are certain films that are made to play with our feelings and with what we consider to be divisive themes. Films about the death penalty almost always do so in one way or another: the topic itself is highly controversial, and almost everyone has an opinion (the level of critical information in opinions varies) about it. The debate about capital punishment will never end, not least because there are legal, human, social and religious reasons that reasonably support who is in favor and who is against it. In the end, it is one of those choices that depends a lot on how the legal and correctional system is viewed, that is, whether we value more, as a society, the exemplary punishment of the criminal or his eventual atonement and correction.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on the memories and experiences of Sister Helen Prejean, a kind-hearted Catholic nun who, over the years, has accompanied and counseled several death row inmates in Louisiana, one of many US states that maintain the active practice. It is a very intimate film, as much of it is focused on the private conversations between the nun and the convict, who in this film is a man who killed a teenage couple, but who claims to be innocent.\r\n\r\nThe script does everything it can to sweeten the story in order to keep our interest: the constant allegations that he may be innocent, the flirtatious atmosphere that sometimes arises between the nun and the prisoner, the passionate (understandable) behavior of the victim's relatives, the various allegations about the promiscuity between the justice system and the conveniences (or inconveniences) of the death sentence for politics and for the image of the Governor. The film makes the most of its theme, shoots in several directions and, for the most part, hits its targets. In addition to being an authentic manifesto against the death penalty, the film is a poignant drama where a clearly evil and vicious man regrets the things he has done, even though it is too late for him. My only negative criticism of the script turns out to be, precisely, the flirtatious atmosphere felt in some parts, and which I think is left in the film, and was not necessary nor particularly positive.\r\n\r\nSusan Sarandon, one of the great actresses of the late 20th century, gives us a remarkable job in which she ended up winning a deserved Oscar for Best Actress. She demonstrates sensitivity and a heightened sense of humanity as she plays the character, and never gives in to the temptation to become overly melodramatic (except, perhaps, for a few sugary, less-than-accomplished moments, near the end). Moreover, this is one of the great works of the actress's career. Sean Penn, on the other hand, still looks young, and is making the most of the opportunity to open doors to grow as an actor. As we know, he's going to do it, and he's going to get great achievements and important awards a few years later. Here, he is responsible for a good performance, in which he balances between resentment, regret, despair and the need for redemption and forgiveness. He never allows his character to appear to be one-dimensional, or too dark, or even too sugary, giving it complexity and various psychological undertones that are worthy of being appreciated.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film is understated, functional and pragmatic. It makes no glaring mistakes, makes good use of source material and the collaboration of the real Sister Helen, who was engaged in this project, and tries to give the actors all the space they need for their work. This is the work of a sensitive and methodical direction by Tim Robbins, who knew how to understand that the film would depend heavily on the work of the two main actors, and he concentrated on extracting from them what he needed without adding anything that would hinder them or distract us. However, I don't think I'm being unfair or flattering if I briefly call attention to the good cinematography, with good framing (the use of bars and other effects to enhance the feeling of confinement) and an excellent setting. The film even has an original song, which was composed by Bruce Springsteen."], ["Co-writers Ian McKellen and Richard Loncraine (who also directs) set their Richard III in 1930s Britain, and make the infamous hunchback a fascist warmonger plotting to usurp the throne. Today's English monarchy is, at best, nominal, but even way back in the 1930s there wasn't much to be gained by usurping it.\r\n\r\nThen again, the film takes place in an alternate reality where the War of the Roses occurs 450 years after the true historical conflict did. I don\u2019t mind so much that royalty has endured those four centuries and a half; what does bother me is that language has not evolved in the interim at the same rate as, say, warfare. Why on Earth would Richard (McKellen), who is neither dumb nor crazy, use the expression \u201cmy kingdom for a horse\u201d when he could be asking for a tank instead?\r\n\r\nThis line is only in the movie because it\u2019s in the play \u2013 but then, a great many things that are in the play aren\u2019t in the film, and viceversa, so why keep this particular bit? I mean, it couldn\u2019t be because the audience is expecting it, even though it makes zero sense given the circumstances, could it? Did they think diehard Shakespeare fans would riot otherwise? Well, if there were such a thing as hardcore Shake-heads, I assure you they would have rioted long before this point.\r\n\r\nSimilarly outdated is a scene in which several characters who have been at each other\u2019s throats are compelled to swear mutual oaths of loyalty. As Al Pacino\u2019s superb documentary Looking for Richard rightly points out, at the time that the original play is set this would be serious business, because only people who want to go to hell would swear an oath and not keep it. Ditto the scene where Richard blames his deformity on Queen Elizabeth's witchcraft; this is an accusation that would have been given credence in the 1470s, but not so much in the 1930s.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, it\u2019s somewhat ironic that McKellen had a hand in the script, because his performance is worthy of much better material.

It stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.\r\n\r\nAn unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.\r\n\r\nHaving been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it's an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it's psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don't want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.\r\n\r\n\"But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever\"\r\n\r\nSeven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman's weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It's going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that's when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there's the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!\r\n\r\nFaultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to \"light\" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10", "Se7en put David Fincher on the map with this uber-creepy mystery thriller. The crime scenes are so grisly Seven is often ranked with top horror movies. And the ending -- hoo boy. One of the best twists in modern movie history.", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI've never written or even thought about my favorite movies of all-time. I don't believe in having a definite Top10 or Top20 of every film I've ever seen. However, if I had to write this special list, I have no doubts that Se7en would be there. Obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched David Fincher's remarkable career (I also ignore the fact that Alien 3 is connected to Fincher due to the known production issues). With his next film, Mank, coming up on Netflix in a few weeks, I decided to go through part of his filmography. Se7en will be the first out of five Fincher's movies that I will be able to revisit throughout this week.\r\n\r\nI've seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, I haven't seen it in so long that I didn't remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. This helped me experience Se7en in a fascinating way once again. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives I've ever witnessed, still to this day. From the very beginning to the last second, I'm constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. Biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions\u2026 it's so mesmerizing that I'm only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after I watched it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive aspects is how Fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. This is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. With just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, Fincher lets the viewer's imagination do the work, and it's undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. As the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the \"seven deadly sins\", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner.\r\n\r\nThe gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. The latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. In 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn't be well-received, and Se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. Over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it's now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. From the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time.\r\n\r\nI'm keeping this review spoiler-free because I don't want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. That's why I'm also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (I'll get there). Fincher's third act is simply flawless. Everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. From the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, Se7en's conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema.\r\n\r\nMorgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn't be more different than one another. Somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. Freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. Pitt portrays Mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. Despite its apparent lack of work ethics, Mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. Pitt, just like Freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation.\r\n\r\nTechnically, where should I begin? From the haunting score of Howard Shore to the documentary-like cinematography (Darius Khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it's the phenomenal production design that stands out. Fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. The first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. Fincher's filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning.\r\n\r\nMovies like Se7en are impossible to be made today, period. It would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. We live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. Nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn't news to anyone. The ending was forced by Pitt and Fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. Today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director's will and/or permission. Se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. Fortunately, it was.\r\n\r\nSe7en might be the best director's sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. David Fincher's classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I've ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer's mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher's trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie's incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it's the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it's a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made\u2026. I can't recommend it more.\r\n\r\nRating: A+", "Some creative kills and a decent atmosphere fail to obscure a vapid nihilism, rather meandering plot with a twist that makes little sense, and some quite nasty misogyny. Basically two or three admittedly masterful performances away from being nothing more than a padded ultra-violent bad Law and Order episode. The Brakhage-inspired title sequence is orders of magnitude better than the film itself. The hodgepodge of contextless references to classic literature doesn't make this any cleverer, either. This is basically everything that people who don't watch \"film bro movies\" unfairly think all modern thrillers are like. Has aged horribly as well.", "Morgan Freeman is the veteran detective \"Somerset\" who is saddled with the newly married rookie \"Mills\" (Brad Pitt) and sent to investigate quite possibly the most ghastly murder scene cinema has ever produced. A man has been force-fed beans until he, quite literally, burst! A missing slither of kitchen floor lino suggests the fridge had recently been moved and behind that they find a clue - one that suggests this man had committed one of the deadly sins (gluttony) and therefore it's reasonable to assume that six more, equally heinous, killings may follow. Indeed when they start to doc just that, both detectives must hastily learn to work together - despite their contrasting approaches to police work - if they are to piece together the evidence. What makes matters worse for the pair, is that they begin to suspect that they are the metaphorical ball of wool for the killer's cat. They get closer and closer, but are always just that little bit late as this self-appointed weapon of god seems to be being wielded with every more horrific killing. David Fincher allows both actors here to develop this mystery compellingly, with a sparing but potent dialogue and an almost perfectly paced and scored progress as we all know what must come last - but never will we anticipate just how the coup de gras will be delivered. This is one of these superior crime dramas that leaves a little more to think about each time I watch it. Really good."], ["Great movie with superb performance from Kevin Spacey, well accompanied with the rest of the cast.", "Keaton always said, \"I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.\" Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze. \r\n\r\nThe Usual Suspects is directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie. It stars Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedaya. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.\r\n\r\nHeld in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint (Spacey) attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor \u2013 leaving few survivors. \r\n\r\nIt sort of sidled into movie theatres in 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices. Yet it wasn't long before word of mouth got around that The Usual Suspects might actually be the must see film of the year. Fledgeling director and writer - Singer and McQuarrie - produce a masterclass of crime/mystery/noir plotting in a whirl of intricate plot shifts and deft sleights of hand.\r\n\r\nThe core essence of the story is simple, just who is Keyser Soze? His reputation is one of utter fear, he may even be the devil himself. What transpires throughout the film is a number of scenes told in flashback form and narrated by Kint as the cops put the heat on him. \r\n\r\nWe are introduced to the five criminals who make up the suspects of the title, where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour. The addition of Postlethwaite's Kobayashi character, one of Soze's harbinger's of doom, further ups the ante of the story's deliciously corkscrew intrigue.\r\n\r\nIt all builds to a climax that - has you pondering just what you have watched previously. Yet here's the key as to why the pic still holds up on repeat viewings, we have been outsmarted, for as we dive in and enjoy the across the board great perfs, we have been privy to something that will stand the test of time for the genre it sits in. The repeat viewings factor still, some decades later, is as strong as ever.\r\n\r\nThe advent of time and home format releases etc have only improved the pic's own mythical status. Behind the scenes egos and dislikes on set only add further strength to the characterisations, as does one main man thinking he himself must be Soze when in fact he was way off. There's a trail of clues in the film that will reveal who Soze is - who knew!? - and on it goes. The Usual Suspects is the filmic gift that keeps on giving. 10/10", "**A clever twist and heavy fan support are the only stand-out aspects of this average heist film.**\r\n\r\nBloggers, reviews, and friends hyped The Usual Suspects for years before I finally watched it, and it was ok. The movie had a pretty clever plot twist that the entire film was building towards from the beginning. Unfortunately, without the twist, the film is pretty mediocre. Brute force characterized the heists over clever planning. Keyser S\u00f6ze's brilliant manipulation of the characters around him seems less mastermind and more taking advantage of criminals that aren't the sharpest tools in the shed. Many people would disagree with me, but The Usual Suspects rates average at best for me.", "**A film that deserves to be revisited and remembered.**\r\n\r\nI think it's unfair that this movie seems to be so forgotten nowadays, but maybe that's because of the intricate plot, loaded with flashbacks. I can understand that, but I think there are even more confusing films out there that have never gone out of style. Anyway, it's a quality film, with good actors and a story, to say the least, intriguing. A small note: the film took home both Oscars for which it was nominated (Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor).\r\n\r\nIt all starts when a group of men, apparently random, is taken by the police to participate in a line-up. What seems at first very casual, is not: all of them were criminals well known to the authorities, and most particularly one of them, who was also a policeman and seemed to have retired from crime and to be living an honest life. After this opening scene, the film shows the efforts of the police to capture those responsible for a shooting on a boat, with several dead and a single survivor, who will tell everything that happened. And I say no more because this script is one of those that gets better the less you know in advance.\r\n\r\nThe cast is dominated by two great actors: Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Spacey. Each in their respective character, but both very committed to their work, they steal the public's attention whenever they appear, ending up being, in a way, complementary: Spacey gives life to an apparently fragile and sick man who would be the most unlikely suspect, whereas Byrne is the typical \"tough guy\". I don't know if I can say that this film is Spacey's best so far, maybe that's premature, but it's safe that his work here opened doors for him to fly higher. Four years later, he would go on to win the Oscar for Best Actor with \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d. Byrne, on the other hand, is one of those talented actors who never seem to have had their big moment in cinema. I also want to highlight the good work of Pete Postlethwaite, in yet another secondary character of strong relevance, two years after receiving his (only so far) Oscar nomination.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I think it's worth praising the direction of Bryan Singer, who stayed true to the suspense and managed to resist the temptation to let the film slip into loud and noisy action scenes that weren't really necessary. The best thing about the film is the tense environment it builds, the enigmatic and mysterious way in which it tells its story, and this would have been partly lost if the director filled his film with random shootings and chases. Another point that deserves a note of praise is the soundtrack, and in particular the main theme, used in the opening and end credits, and which is perfectly atmospheric. The rest remains average, but is done without glaring errors. The only points I feel I should criticize negatively are the opening credits graphics, which look very dated now.", "Upon watching The Usual Suspects, I was initially excited to see what all the hype was about however, I found the film to be somewhat of a letdown. That being said, I do think that there were some strong aspects to the movie.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, The Usual Suspects was quite impressive. The camera direction by Bryan Singer was particularly noteworthy, especially given that this was only his second full-length feature film.\r\n\r\nWhere the movie fell short for me was in the writing. While the dialogue and overall story were intriguing, the way they were executed left much to be desired. In particular, the first act of the film was disjointed and difficult to follow. The audience was thrown right into the middle with the suspected criminals, with little information given about their backstories or their connections to one another. As new characters were introduced, the plot became even more complex and convoluted, making it challenging to keep up with all the moving pieces. Once the film starts to conclude the second act, the pieces become a little more streamlined, which makes the back half of the movie much more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nIn terms of acting, the performances were a bit of a mixed bag. Some actors, such as Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne, delivered grounded and impressive performances. However, other characters felt like overacted caricatures of quirky criminals, such as Benicio del Toro's character.\r\n\r\nOne of the main selling points of The Usual Suspects is its \"incredible\" twist ending. However, I personally saw it coming from a mile away, which was a bit disappointing. It's possible that the film's score may improve upon a second viewing, but for now, I can only give it three stars. That rating is primarily due to the strong technical aspects of the movie, as without those, it would likely only receive two-and-a-half stars.\r\n\r\nScore: 56% \u26a0\ufe0f\r\nVerdict: Decent", "SUPERNATURAL THRILLER\r\nDirector Singer and writer McQuarrie won't admit that it's a supernatural thriller, and insist it's just the goofy Hollywood movie it appears to be at first, but a few viewings will let you know that it is indeed a supernatural thriller. \r\nThe story centers around five criminals who think they are gods, and therein lies the first clue to this being a sueprnatural thriller. Also, one of the men, Keaton, played by a Judd Hirsch look alike named Gabriel Byrne, is making a deal, along with his lawyer girlfriend, with some men in a high level restaurant. \r\nUpon a few viewings, you will realize that these men are not what they seem, because the lady lawyer eventually is seen making a \"deal with the devil\".\r\nThe \"devil\" is known to the five men as a character called \"Kaiser\". The allusions to Caesar (which the word \"kaiser\" comes from) is a biblical reference to a supernatural evil. \r\nYou will find out who the devil is when you realize that the biblical devil is incapable of telling the truth, and so everything he says is a lie. The five criminals all believe they can be \"better devils\". One of the five is actually a stand in for the female lawyer, for reasons you will know if you watch the film.", "A true masterpiece of the crime genre! Five usual suspects are rounded up by the police to take part in an identity parade following a New York heist. It's clear that they had nothing to do with it, but when pitched together decide that they will avenge themselves on the NYPD. Their scheme progresses well until the intervention of international super-criminal \"Keyser S\u00f6ze\" via his debonaire but menacing agent \"Mr. Kobayashi\" (a superb Pete Posthlethwaite) and soon it becomes clear that the police are not the only people who are the targets here. It's told in a clever, retrospective, narrative style with some great performances from Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne that leaves us pondering just who is \"S\u00f6ze\" and to deal with an ending that you\"ll never forget!"], ["**_An older man befriends a kindhearted prostitute_**\r\n\r\nA Manhattan scriptwriter (Woody Allen) meets the young mother of his adopted boy, a hooker (Mira Sorvino), and tries to help her situation. Meanwhile, his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) is caught up in her ambitious work as a curator of art galleries, not to mention the serious flirting of a colleague (Peter Weller).  A Greek chorus occasionally chimes in (F. Murray Abraham, etc.), linking the story to that of Oedipus.\r\n\r\n\u201cMighty Aphrodite\u201d (1995) is a quirky comedy set in Manhattan, which is unsurprising with Woody at the helm. The heart of the plot, described in my title blurb above, is reminiscent of \u201cHardcore\u201d (1979) minus the gravity. \r\n\r\nBoth Helena and Mira were in their prime and look great in totally opposite ways. The flick is amusing, touching and ironic. I enjoyed the audacious Greek chorus element, something few filmmakers could pull off, but Woody does so effortlessly.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan with the Greek chorus scenes done at Teatro Greco on Sicily, Italy.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"], ["**A beautiful Italian production.**\r\n\r\nIf there is something that manages to cause serious expression problems in the most flirtatious and fluent of men, it is the ardent gaze of the girl he loves. I know this from experience, and any man who has been in love, at least once, knows that it is not easy to choose the right moment and the right words to express the greatness and beauty of feelings. Things get worse, of course, if the man is shy or less experienced in Cupid's dealings. Then, yes, things get really complicated!\r\n\r\nContrary to what the film might make us think, it is not necessary to be a poet to tell a beautiful woman that we love her. Well, from the little that has happened to me, what often happens is that love itself transforms us into incidental, fortuitous poets. And if the first verses are given to us by the gods, the muse of our affection easily inspires the rest. And that's how poetry is made: through the adventures and misfortunes of the heart of those who write it!\r\n\r\nThis Italian production tackles these questions by facing two characters who, otherwise, might never meet: one is Mario Ruoppolo, a former fisherman who became a postman because he doesn't get along with seasickness, and who feels not being able to express how he feels about the girl he is in love with; the other is the famous Chilean communist poet Pablo Neruda, famous for his socialist verbiage and for the romantic sonnets that earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature. The contrast could not be greater: the simplicity and natural shyness of the popular man and the expressiveness and charisma of a consecrated public figure. And if one has ascendancy over the other, I cannot say that the popular man seems to have had great importance for the public figure, despite the fact that the film tries to instill it.\r\n\r\nMassimo Troisi, in addition to assisting director Michael Redford, brilliantly secures the lead role, giving Ruoppolo a balanced dose of modesty, shyness and curiosity. The only negative criticism I can make of him is the way he fades and darkens whenever he has to play with Neruda, well played by Philippe Noiret. However, it cannot be denied that the best parts of the film are the dialogues and scenes in which both are together. And in fact, the dialogues deserve a special note, for the quality and the way they were done. Renato Scarpa is irritating due to the excessive politicization of his character, which is as tiresome and repetitive as the political discourse of most communist and socialist politicians. If we listen to one in a single speech, we listen to them all in everything they might want to say. Despite not appearing much and not really having much to do, Maria Grazia Cucinotta is a welcome addition to the plot, as well as being magnificent and so beautiful that any man in the street would turn his head to admire her for longer (something that happens much to the ragazze of Italy, on account of the great merit of their beauty).\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has some merits: if the cinematography is not particularly remarkable and looks misty and aged, the scenic beauty of the filming locations and the film's sets compensates for them, with plenty of room and with an abundance of light, sun, sea, magnificent outdoor scenes and truly breathtaking landscapes. The melody also deserves a frankly positive note: in addition to fitting harmoniously with the film and each scene, it is beautiful, very well conceived and stays in the ear.", "With things unstable in his native Chile, renowned poet \"Neruda\" (Philippe Noiret) takes refuge on a small Italian island where his arrival is greeted with little more than a realisation that they are going to need to hire an extra postman! Step forward \"Mario\" (Massimo Troisi). He can barely read or write but is determined to engage the visitor in conversation and to learn from him. Initially indifferent, \"Neruda\" begins to converse with him as he delivers the daily post and when he declares he needs some help to woo the charming \"Beatrice\" (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), he finds himself with a new mentor. Now it's fair to say that his first attempts are maybe just a little too rough and ready. Too many references to the shapeliness of her breasts and such like, but gradually \"Mario\" learns how to express himself more fully, more characterfully, and less earthily too. This education also opens his eyes to what has been going on around him for years. His island doesn't even have running water and with elections looming, he finds himself drawn to a communist cause as he watches the visiting politicians make promises he knows will never be delivered. His new found political awareness doesn't always go down so well with his compatriots who just want to get on with their simple, maritime, lives. This adaptation of Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta's book really does imbue the characters with a generous spirit and loads of charisma. It's all understated, and the evolution of \"Mario\" is really well handled by Troisi who sort of co-directed with Michael Radford and with a delicately honest effort from Noiret too. The cinematography benefits hugely from the natural island scenario which at times seems to mirror the emotions being played out by the people. This is also quite an effective analysis of what constitutes poetry itself. The subtlety of the structure of the words that don't rely on the all-too-familiar rhymes is used to good effect. Another film that befits hugely from a cinema screen to enjoy the brightness and Luis Bacalov score and is really worth a watch."], ["***Taking a bypass from your dreams and finding your true calling***\r\n\r\nA composer (Richard Dreyfuss) puts his lofty ambitions on hold to become a high school music teacher in Portland, Oregon, from 1965-1995. Glenne Headly plays his wife, Jay Thomas the coach, Olympia Dukakis the principal and William H. Macy the irritating vice principal.     \r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holland\u2019s Opus\" (1995) is a good school-oriented drama that\u2019s episodic in nature since it spans 30 years. The first 40 minutes were decent, but I was wondering if the film would be able to absorb me into its story, especially considering its considerable length. It did, particularly the episodes concerning Terrence Howard (playing Louis Russ) and angelic Jean Louisa Kelly (Rowena).  \r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s kind of a meshing of \u201cDead Poets Society\u201d (1989) crossed with \u201cForrest Gump\u201d (1994), although not great like either of those flicks. But it\u2019s a solid drama. A 19 year-old Alicia Witt is on hand as one of the students in the first act.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 23 minutes and was shot in Portland, Oregon, and nearby Marylhurst.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "**Another good film about an outstanding teacher marking the lives of his students... another one.**\r\n\r\nOne of the things I like most about a film, in addition to telling a good story and positively entertaining us for an hour or two, is to reflect on different subjects and themes. This exercise of critical questioning, free and reachable to the public, much more attractive than a six-hundred-page book, is one of the most important qualities of cinema. And this film has lots of themes and topics worthy of our reflection.\r\n\r\nFirst, I should say that the film is very good! It is very forgotten today and deserves to be revisited. It is, I think, the best film of Stephen Herek, an average director, more focused on TV, actually. The merit of the film falls, largely, on the great quality of the script by Patrick Sheane Duncan, who created the story of a composer who becomes a music teacher at a high school to earn some income and ends up marking several generations of students, teaching them to love music while trying to protect and support their own son, who was born deaf.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a deep and moving story, we have good actors working in a very committed way: Richard Dreyfuss may be an actor who is a little far from the spotlight, but he gives us an extraordinary performance in this film and was nominated for the Oscar (he lost to Nick Cage, who shone in \u201cLeaving Las Vegas\u201d in a more psychologically challenging role). Glenne Headly and a young Terrence Howard gave him welcome and very solid support.\r\n\r\nThe film moves us with its story, highlighting the importance of music and the relevance of artistic education. In a society where, more and more, we are appreciated for the money we earn to our employers (or companies, or countries), the arts and human sciences (history and philosophy, for example) are underappreciated because they are considered to have very few professional opportunities and practical applicability. The situation could not be more unfair: the human sciences teach us to think, to have a critical conscience and a vast general culture, while the arts transmit us an aesthetic sense and a capacity for self-expression that, unlike writing, tends to be universally intelligible. It's a shame that human resources directors often turn out to be such obtuse people, with such short horizons. The film addresses deafness in an interesting way, showing us that even a deaf person can appreciate music and that deafness is no impediment to an active and happy life.\r\n\r\nThe film has only two major problems: the first problem, and for me the most serious, is falling back on the older clich\u00e9s about school films involving teachers, and all the impact they have. This was done, much more effectively, in \u201cDead Poets Society\u201d and \u201cMona Lisa Smile\u201d. At this point, the most essential of the plot, there is nothing original. The second problem is that unreasonable romantic tension between Holland and one of his young and seductive students. We all know that the relationship between a student and her teacher is one of the most appealing erotic fantasies among middle-aged men, and I can understand why they included that sub-plot, but it's beside the point and should never have been included in the final cut."], [], ["This movie is directed by Robert Rodriquez and has a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino who also has a role in the film. This is actually one of the first movies by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino that I watched and from then on I pretty much became a fan of them both. So, when it came out on Blu-ray a while ago I had to get it for the collection of course.\r\n\r\nWhen I and my dear wife first watched this movie we did not really know what it was all about. We thought it was just another robbery/criminal story and the first half of the movie it is indeed \u201cjust\u201d a robbery/criminal story. It is a fairly violent one at that which should be no surprise given who it is that have their fingers in the movie.\r\n\r\nThen half way into the movie everything goes wild when the vampires enter the scene.

Needless to say this is one of my favourite cult/bizarre movies.", "Outrageous!\r\n\r\nIt was probably the most fun I had at the cinema back in 1996. I absolutely love \"From Dusk Till Dawn\", very much one of those films that you either buy into or you don't. There's no surprise element with the film, you get everything that director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino said you would get - a hard buttocked road movie that turns into a raging \"B\" horror movie gore fest.\r\n\r\nThe plot, for what's it's worth, sees two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) & Richie Gecko (Tarantino) on the lam after Richie breaks Seth out of prison. They are heading for the haven of Mexico with wads of cash garnered from a robbery. After overcoming a couple of fatal (for others) hiccups, the brothers, in need of a vehicle, kidnap faithless minister Jacob (Harvey Keitel), his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu). From here they must make it to a rendezvous point in Mexico - a bar called \"The Titty Twister\", where they will exchange cash with a friend of Seth's and start their new lives as Mexican civilians. Trouble is, is that \"The Titty Twister\" isn't no ordinary bar, it's a vampire stronghold and the Geko's - and their newly acquired captives, are on the menu. Can they make it till dawn and let the daylight be their saviour?.\r\n\r\nSwearing, blood, limbs severed, nudity, violence, sexual references, guns, more violence, more blood, other weapons, lots of teeth, bats, a snake, more violence. On it goes really, yet as Rodriguez and Tarantino start thrusting a blunt blade into your stomach, you really should be feeling them also caressing the funny bones in both your arms. For it's a key point that \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" is a damn funny film as well, something that bizarrely many critics have failed to understand. Honestly you can go to various sites and read people saying the characters are shallow, or the plot is preposterous!! Dear me, it staggers the mind. Hey don't like the film by all means, but failure to understand its genre leanings and homage persuasion is as funny as Cheech Marin is in the movie (one of many awesome \"B\" cult movie actors in the pic). It's bonkers and silly as hell, but once a fan of \"From Dusk Till Dawn\", you are a fan for life. Well as long as you don't venture out to \"The Titty Twister\" yourself of course..\r\n\r\nWelcome To Slavery. 9/10", "So \"Seth\" (George Clooney) and his nasty brother \"Richard\" (Quentin Tarantino) leave a trail of death and mayhem as they head to the safety of Mexico after robbing a bank then trashing a convenience store and a motel! Close to the border, they abduct a pastor \"Jacob\" (Harvey Keitel) and his family and use them to slip un-noticed across the border before heading to a lively brothel \"Titty Twister\". Once there, and suitably tanked up with booze, they discover that there is something distinctly fishy (and it's not just with the stockings) as darkness descends and the clientele, well let's just say they get hungry... What now ensues is a bloodbath worth of any Hammer film - and frankly, it's of about the same standard. Tarantino may well be formidable behind the camera, but in from of it he is hopeless. Clooney fares a little better but it's really only Keitel who manages to keep this increasingly farcical film moving along for what seems like an age. I found what passed for humour to be pretty vulgar and tawdry and to be honest, I was rather bored with the relentlessness and repetition of the whole thing one we had got past the obligatory violent stages of the plot development. Was it supposed to be a comedy?

Horror ensues. \r\n\r\n\"From Dusk Till Dawn\" (1996) is a crime thriller/horror directed by Robert Rodriguez from Tarantino's script. Mixing \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) with the basic plot of \"Vamp\" (1986) and bits of \"The Lost Boys\" (1987) and \"The Evil Dead\" (1981), it pulsates with hip energy and flair. \r\n\r\nClooney shines in his first feature film as the antagonist-turned-protagonist. Salma Hayek's dance routine is jaw-dropping and iconic. The movie blends weighty spirituality with extreme irreverence, violence, gore and comic booky evil for a entertaining flick, if you can stomach the nasty elements. It's not scary at all; but it's fun and thrilling in an increasingly farcical context, with thoughtful dialog and black humor.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in Barstow, Lancaster, Calico Dry Lake and Los Angeles, California; as well as Chihuahua, Mexico.

The story line of this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through the movie. Mel Gibson does a really good job with the accent and plays a great role as William Wallace in the movie.\r\n\r\nI cant help by want to stand up and shout FREEDOM! once the movie is finished. Could watched this movie another 1000 times and not get board of watching it. It's a must watch for any one who has not see it yet.", "Historical flaws aside, Braveheart is a rousing spectacle.\r\n\r\nSo it comes to pass in the year of 1995 (not a year of our lord I think) that Mel Gibson would craft the award winning epic that is Braveheart, a film that is historically bent in the extreme, that is directed by a man who would go on to have a less than favourable character reputation, and a film that has a heavy handed approach at times. It's also as choppy as a boat ride during a tidal wave, so yes, Braveheart is far from flawless folks. Yet the structure, the epic emotional swirls and sheer spectacle of it all marks it out as a rousing treat.\r\n\r\nIt's a lavish gargantuan epic that somehow seems out of place for the year it was made, perhaps the secret of the films' success is because the 90s were crying out for an epic to get us hankering back to those halcyon days of Spartacus et al. Or just maybe the film punched the buttons of the public psyche because it is a great and grand thing to see the little people rise up and kick some ass? The oppressed and the bullied strike back as it were, surely that theme works for the normal human being? It's a sweeping tale that involves love, loyalty, honour, dishonour, treachery, death & heroes and villains. In short it ticks all the boxes for the genre it sits in (clinical bloody battles superbly full on). Gibson is William Wallace, and although he may struggle to nail the Scottish accent to fully convince at times, he more than makes up for it with his verve and vigour when delivering his lines - with the Sons Of Scotland speech at Stirling a particular iconic highlight.\r\n\r\nPatrick McGoohan is pure egotistical villainy as Longshanks, King Edward I, and the supporting cast also do sterling work (or should that be Stirling?). Brendan Gleeson, Tommy Flanagan, Catherine McCormack, Angus Macfadyen, and the wonderful James Cosmo all add flavour to the delightful scotch broth on the screen. The score by James Horner is appropriately tight to the themes at work in the piece, and the cinematography by John Toll was rightly awarded at Oscar time since he captured the essence of the film. Be it the lush rolling hills or the blood stained field in the aftermath of battle, Toll's work is critically in sync with the unfolding mood of the picture.\r\n\r\nSo yes, damn straight, flaws and all, pic has the ability to lift and inspire many a discerning viewer. It does kick you at times, but as it does so, it also emotionally engages you from start to finish - to which the film deserves every accolade and award that it won. Because the grandiose epic had seemed long gone, but Gibson and his army brought it back to the modern era and made a genre piece fit to hold it's head up high with the greats of years gone by. 10/10", "When i saw this I was 15 and it was one of the greatest movies I had ever seen. Fast forward to today, I'm 41, and degrees and history and... the battle of Sterling Bridge is like fingernails on a chalkboard whenever I see it.\r\n\r\nI watched it with my wife and, \"no, she was like 3 and living in France.\"\r\n\r\nSo I don't know. It was dramatic and moody and stylistically beautiful. It was a typical Gibson gore fest and that is always fun. It was well acted, the score added to the drama, and it spawned a movement in Scotland that they are still dealing with today...\r\n\r\n... so it is still a really good film.\r\n\r\nIt just, well... where the heck is the bridge?", "I am afraid that as a Scotsman, I had way more problem with the factual elements of this than perhaps I ought to have had. We have this history drummed into us as bairns, and so when a grand-scale depiction like this comes along, I excitedly expected more. It doesn't matter a jot that the eponymous Mel Gibson isn't a Scot - that is the acting equivalent of a red herring. What matters is that the story is largely a work of fiction. Gory, beautiful, authentic looking, certainly - but fiction nonetheless. Taken on that basis, then, it is still an entertaining mediaeval drama depicting the struggle of the king-less Scots against the oppression of England's King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Using a panoply of familiar faces, it gradually demonstrates the brutality of the English over these vassals, and introduces us to \"William Wallace\" (Gibson) who is one of the few who wishes to fight back. The killing of his wife at the hands of his local magistrate (Malcolm Tierney) is the last straw, and soon he is working with his kinsman Argyle (Brian Cox) to formulate a plan. What now ensues is a well produced, stylishly filmed drama offering us plenty of scheming and plotting and some seriously gory battle scenes before it all culminates in the unavoidable denouement. It takes it's time to get underway, but once it is up and running it is well paced, there is a minimum of romance, plenty of swordplay and lots of unadulterated freedom-fighter jingoism. Why not? It is a film about a man who fought for the freedom of his people against the tyranny of an interloper, and is effective at that. The historical timelines are a bit all over the place, as are many of the characterisations, but again that's another matter of fact that we have had to ditch at the opening titles. \"Braveheart\" is exciting, fast-moving and bloody - just what it is meant to be, and for that Gibson ought to be commended. Just a shame it couldn't be just bit more rooted in fact."], ["**Social outcast with a mohawk goes nutzoid**\r\n\r\nPorn obsessed loner, Travis Bickle, is a cabbie in New York.

Walton's self imposed isolation preferable to getting along with the scum around him. One day he decides to change all of that and become _a somebody_ by murdering a politician.\r\n\r\nThis _nobody_ with the superiority complex has gone off the rails, for certain and it can only lead to bloodshed. A lot of it will be his own.", "Taxi Driver has had many things said about it, and I don't wish to add to all that but it is the yardstick I measure all other films by, it is by far my favourite of all the films I have ever watched.\r\n\r\nIt's brutal honesty and use of themes such as paranoia, mental health issues, and society degradation make it a film that has been imitated, and referenced since its opening in cinemas back in 1976.\r\n\r\nRobert De Niro puts in a tour-de-force performance as Travis Bickle, a Vietnam War veteran with symptoms of PTSD and paranoia, who becomes a New York City taxi driver because of his inability to sleep. Travis is one who is at odds with society, fed up with pimps, prostitutes, drug dealers, and all the other scum of the earth, he slowly works himself in his sleep deprived and drugged state to become a one man army ready to kill anyone he believes to be part of the problem.\r\n\r\nHis interactions with other cabbies, Betsy (Shepherd) a Presidential Candidate campaign worker, Iris a teenage prostitute (Foster), and her Pimp \u201cSport\u201d (Keitel) fuels his destructive mission to rid New York City of its problems. His attempt at normalcy with Betsy, by taking her on date to a movie that disagrees with her sensibilities ends in disaster, mostly due to Travis\u2019 supposed naivety about what is considered appropriate and tasteful entertainment.\r\n\r\nWhile plying his nightly trade as a NYC cabbie, he has some unusual encounters, including a fare from a fairly psychotically jealous man showing Travis the place where the man\u2019s wife is cheating on him, and then a short encounter with Iris who gets in his cab, and then forced out by Sport, who throws Travis a dirty crumpled up twenty dollar note for the trouble, Travis then makes it his mission to rescue Iris from her situation while also making a menace of himself to the visiting Presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nThis film is still relevant in these times, as social media, and other such technological & society advancements have brought about a new degradation of values, with many wanting their fifteen minutes of fame by any means necessary, which now brings with it many who sell their souls to attain notoriety.\r\n\r\nI love De Niro's performance as Travis, its one that has many facets to it, in it is a man who is angry, naive, sleep deprived, lonely, a sociopath, and a killer.\r\n\r\nA scene in the Presidential campaign office where he is rebuffed by Betsy due to the terrible date experience, and ushered, and menaced by the opportunistic & snotty campaign co-worker Tom (Brooks), shows the range of De Niro's performance as he goes from apologetic, and sheepish to angry, and ready to fight. De Niro was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for this role.\r\n\r\nThe presentation on blu-ray is a solid one, PQ is nice, skin tones not waxy, and the AQ allowing the score, and surrounding noise subtleties to really shine through, it's very well handled for a source filmed in the mid 70's", "Robert De Niro is outstanding in this dark and gritty depiction of former marine \"Travis Bickle\". He spends his time, alone, driving his cab at night then watching seedy movies during the day. This relentless cycle is broken when he takes a shine to \"Betsy\" (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign worker for a would be US Presidential candidate. There is a glimmer of hope for him, as she agrees to go out with him for a movie - but when he takes her to his usual haunt for a Swedish film that perhaps wasn't quite Ingmar Bergman, he ends up back at square one. Simultaneously, he takes a more protective interest in the young \"iris\" (Jodie Foster) - a teenage hooker who is being used abused by her pimp, and to that end he acquires some firearms with which he is perfectly proficient, and so finally starts to see a purpose for his hitherto rather rudderness existence. Director Martin Scorsese and veteran scorer Bernard Hermann have created a wonderfully convincing and evocative scenario emphasising the seediness of a night time New York in which De Niro is able to thrive as few other actors could. He exudes a sense of helplessness but also of decency; he has integrity almost in spite of the indifference of his city, his peers - and by the end, I was firmly in his corner. If you can see it up on a big screen, then do so - it lends a great deal to this wonderfully atmospheric and potent piece of cinema."], ["**Sympathetic humor and impressive beatings in a very poorly made film, which entertains its audience.**\r\n\r\nAlthough I know the actor from other movies, this was the first Jackie Chan movie I saw. He brings to life a friendly young man from Hong Kong who comes to the USA for his uncle's wedding, who has lived in the Bronx, New York, for many years. During his stay, he will see his uncle sell his shop in order to retire and spend his old age on a ranch, and he will also have to face a biker gang and a mafia organization that has lost a bag of diamonds that end up in the power of the character played by Chan. Of course, it's all going to end up in a beating.\r\n\r\nThe film is quite good at its simple and direct task of entertaining the audience. There's a nice, well-measured mix of humor and action. The jokes are quite naive, but they work and give the film a familiar and friendly touch that is pleasant without turning it into a tear-jerking comedy. The fight scenes are the strong point, and it is worth seeing the highly choreographed fights that Chan fights with ten or twenty opponents simultaneously, and in which he uses all his knowledge of martial arts. However, let's not have any illusions: the film shows the fight scenes a little faster than in reality, which amplifies the effect, but takes away the verisimilitude of what we are seeing.\r\n\r\nChan is likeable and perhaps one of the most palatable actors in the vast universe of stars whose careers were based on thuggish films (Van Damme, Chuck Norris and others). He deserves a good grade, both for his acting and for his fight scenes. Unfortunately, he's the only actor worth mentioning because the others are all pretty amateurish. But let no one think that Chan gives us a lesson in acting! He does what he's supposed to do: be funny and kick ass. It's Jackie Chan, not Lawrence Olivier. Anita Mui and Fran\u00e7oise Yip are here simply because the film needed some pretty faces.\r\n\r\nThe script is quite weak, a mere excuse for high doses of comedy and beatings for all tastes. The poverty of the script is such that, halfway through the film, we already forget the names of the characters and why Chan came to the US. These are questions that we soon feel are irrelevant (or rather, that were considered irrelevant in this film). The villains are really weak - the mobsters look scared, and the biker gang is ridiculous. However, all of this is relatively forgivable when we think of the poor editing work that went into this film. The cuts couldn't be more obvious and misplaced. There are scenes that seem to be inserted with a hammer, others appear suddenly, or end suddenly, just like the film itself, which ends so suddenly that it feels like an episode of a TV series and not a film for the cinema."], ["I remember thinking that Dan Futterman was quite attractive in this film as the young \"Val\", but boy does his turn out to be one of the most selfish and thoughtless of characters!

Thing is, he is going to marry the daughter of the rather puritanical senator \"Keeley\" (Gene Hackman) and so they are going to have to play happy, heterosexual, families when the prospective in-laws come to visit. \"Armand\" manages his disappointment rather better than his lover who, inclined to the histrionic at the best of times, takes it as all as a personal slight and a mega-strop ensues.

Suddenly he needs to get away, and so to the \"Birdcage\" he, wife \"Louise\" (Dianne Wiest) and intended bride \"Barbara\" (Calista Flockhart) duly head. The press get wind of this, and of the fact that it's a fairly ostentatious gay club - and so are just praying to get some snaps of this visit. Can the family stay on a even keel long enough for the estranged mother \"Katherine\" (Christine Baranski) to arrive, and can they manage to avoid implicating the holier-than-thou politician in the mother of all scandals? Time hasn't been especially kind to this, but Williams and an excellently hammy Nathan Lane do well keeping the momentum going as we to and fro with tantrums a-plenty. Weist and Hackman work well too, but the starring role has to belong to Hank Azaria's camp \"Agador\" who takes crop-tops to an whole new level.

Ron Howard now presents us with a potently claustrophobic couple of hours and the men - Lovell (Tom Hanks); Haise (Bill Paxton) and Swigert (Kevin Bacon) must work with their ground control colleagues led by Mattingly (Gary Sinese) and Kranz (an excellent Ed Harris) to try to calculate some way of getting them back to safety before their remaining oxygen and fuel runs out. Meantime, we also get a sense of the mortality of these travellers from their partners left on Earth - not least from an on-form Kathleen Quinlan (Marilyn Lovell). The screenplay is based on the book by Lovell, and reeks of authenticity. There is little need to embellish it with special effects; the sets adequately convey the dangers and sense of confinement as the clock ticks down. The dialogue is strong - pithy and lively but also well based in science. That enables Hanks to turn in one of his more convincing, less quirky performances which gels well with his acting co-stars. History tells us the ending, so it is not that the film has jeopardy - it hasn't, really. What is does have is an accumulated sense of peril and it demonstrates well how adaptable and innovative the human brain can be when facing almost certain death. The production is top drawer - understated but effective, and the score from James Horner is one of his lesser known, but none the less effective for that.

Gone is the dark undertone from Tim Burton's visions, and the tight action sequences that marked Burton's debut out as a genuine genre piece of work, in their place comes sexy campery and ropey action set pieces. The casting of both Val Kilmer as Batman and Chris O'Donnell as Robin is a big mistake, Kilmer easily being the most boring actor to don the suit out of all of them, whilst O'Donnell simply can't act outside of Robin's cartoonery bravado. Nicole Kidman looks positively gorgeous as Chase Meridian, but that's all that is brought to the party, it's a waste of the very talented Kidman's ability and a waste of the audience's time.\r\n\r\nIt's not all bad though, a comic book adaptation is only as good as its villains, and here we get a perfectly cast Jim Carrey as The Riddler, and a wildly over the top Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Carrey steals every scene he is in, it's almost too much, but as maniacal and exuberant as it is, it is the film's highlight and actually the film's saving grace (Tommy Lee Jones was reportedly unhappy from having his thunder stolen in the movie by Carrey). The script does work enough to make the story accessible to all ages, and there are enough crash bangs and wallops to entertain in that brain left at the door kind of way.\r\n\r\nThis was the biggest hit of 1995, so the paying public lapped it up and paved the way for another Schumacher film in the franchise, but with all that star power wasted, and nipples on the rubber suits, it's hard to see now why it was so popular back then. 5/10", "There are some great **things** in _Batman Forever_. Val Kilmer I think cops a bit too much flak for his go in the cape & cowl, he's certainly no sort of definitive Batman but I thought he did a fine job.

Increasingly exasperated, she hears of a \"facility\" run by \"Madame Anais\" (Genevi\u00e8ve Page) where some of those kinks might be ironed out!

Deneuve is great here as the classy hooker with fetish tendencies, as is Page as the sagely and businesslike mistress. It's Bu\u00f1uel's clever adaptation of the quirky Joseph Kessel novel that really does allow Deneuve to deliver an engaging, if not always likeable, \"Severine\" character effectively.

The film then twists and turns as the sub is divided into two factions, mutiny is rife, but what will the outcome be? Can the radio be fixed to complete the order? Will it be too late? All these questions are tensely drawn out by Scott to get the maximum impact from what is an admittedly standard global crisis in waiting story.\r\n\r\nNo shortage of machismo here either, brutishly brilliant is how I find Gene Hackman in this, his Captain Ramsey is the quintessential leader of men. Then there is Denzel Washington as Ron Hunter, eloquently spoken and a voice of reason, his ruggedness coming to the fore as the submarine starts to implode. There are few better sights in 90s cinema than watching Hackman & Washington go at each other the way they do here, starting off as just a fractious relationship, it then explodes into a war of belief and wills. It's through these pair that the film's neutral stance shines bright, what would we do in similar circumstances? Who would we follow? Both men ethically right, yet both men accountable for probable disaster.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful picture, a lesson in tough tension building that is perfectly wrung out by a rousing Han Zimmer score, with the only weak point being a multi written script that tries to fuse pop culture references with technical lingo, something which doesn't quite sit right. However, even that can't hurt the excellently unfolding sequence of events that closes quite brilliantly with a written piece that all of us should take note of. 9/10", "Probably my favourite Tony Scott film, amidst stiff competition. The acting of both Hackman and Washington, plus the fine supporting cast, is top-drawer, and Scott keeps the suspense up, the film's as tight as a drum. It's rumoured that there were plenty of script doctors, including Quentin Tarantino, but that's no crime--especially when it works. One of my favourite submarine films--it's up there in my books with 'Destination Tokyo' (I haven't seen my DVD of 'Das Boot' yet). It's a great shame that Scott decided to take his life a few years back. He was a much better director than I used to give him credit for. I guess it's true that we don't realize just how good people are until they're gone. This film's essential for war film enthusiasts or those who enjoy suspense films or thrillers: It wouldn't be out of place in the oeuvres of, say, Sir Alfred Hitchcock or David Fincher, and would make a great double-bill with 'Lifeboat' or 'They Were Expendable'.", "I'm a big fan of submarine thrillers, and on the face of it - this should have been good. Gene Hackman is the experienced Captain of the USS \"Alabama\", sent to sea with a new Executive Officer (Denzel Washington) amidst a crisis in Russia that could result in nuclear warfare. Once on their mission, the two men dance around each other, probing and testing until they get a message to launch their missiles. This is where it ought to have become more interesting. The captain determined to obey orders, the XO keen to verify. Tempers flare and when a rogue Russian sub opens fire on them, things pass a point of no return. Which man is correct, and will they fire or not? Sadly, at this point the drama becomes all to farcical as the tautly directed opening scenarios between the two men become absurdly tribal antics onboard - to the point where the last half hour or so just beggars belief. Hackman and Washington are efficient, but nether really convince before an ending that really let's the whole thing down badly. What could have been quite a thought-provoking drama about just how far people will go to follow orders or protocols when push comes to shove is just wasted. Shame, really."], [], ["This was a solid and highly enjoyable take on the spaghetti western by Rodriguez that rightfully put the director on the map and provided star Antonio Banderas the breakthrough he needed in the American marketplace. Though I love his work on the Sin City films, particularly the first, his incredible earlier trilogy will always hold a special place in my cinephilic heart.\r\n\r\nMy recent project of coming to terms with classic Westerns has only further helped me enjoy these more recent contemporary releases.", "**Action, shots, bullets and\u2026 \u201clatinxploitation\u201d?**\r\n\r\nI confess that I expected something more from this film. I was left with the feeling that it has little to offer us other than two tons of spectacular action scenes, with explosions, hundreds of gunshots and some gratuitous destruction. Even more: it reminded me of those films from the 70s, which we call \u201cblaxploitation\u201d because they reinforced a series of stereotypes about the African-American community: if we pay attention, we have almost all the stereotypes attributed to Latinos and Mexicans-Americans.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'm not a fan of political correctness and I don't care about stereotypes! I deal with this well, being a proud Portuguese who was born and lives in a Latin country, but I am in solidarity with those who, especially in the USA, suffer from prejudices about the Latin community, a vast community that encompasses Castilian and Portuguese speakers, forgetting, interestingly, that Italian Americans are also culturally Latino. Robert Rodr\u00edguez is Latino and makes films that reflect that. I think he must be a man proud of his roots, and I think that's magnificent. We must have this pride. Therefore, I think he made this film in that spirit, but my doubts lie in this: a film with so much violence, with so much to do with drugs and crime, was it good or bad for Latinos?\r\n\r\nAnt\u00f3nio Banderas is one of the greatest Spanish actors of all time and easily transitioned to Hollywood, where his career took on stratospheric proportions. Here, he did an interesting job, mixing a bit of Latin lover with gangster and Zorro. He has the right profile and was a good choice. I also really enjoyed seeing Joaquim de Almeida, my compatriot, in what was the best North American film he has made to date (and I think that productions could really invest more in this actor, I think he has talent and ability). Steve Buscemi adds a friendly touch to the film, and Danny Trejo and Tarantino make brief, innocuous appearances. Salma Hayek, another good actress, unfortunately just has to be sexy and hot in bed. That's not enough.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the production budget was, but it doesn't seem like a cheap film to me because the number of strong names in the industry in this project is considerable and no one, nowadays, works for free. We also have a good special effects department, with great capacity and creativity: the sets are very realistic and the film's action scenes are very well thought out and executed. As an action film, it works impeccably and is a delight for fans. The script, unfortunately, is much less interesting, with too many stereotypes, weaknesses, clich\u00e9s and insipid dialogues."], [], ["**It would be an excellent sequel, every bit as good as the original, if logic issues and plot holes didn't get in the way too much.**\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I can say that I really enjoyed the first film in this trilogy, I can't say the same for any of the sequels. The first film, even with all the flaws, was quite good and was so enjoyable that it became a milestone for many people's childhood and adolescence. This one, in addition to not bringing anything really new, has more flaws and problems than its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe film's biggest problem turns out to be the script: the action takes place some time after the events of the first film, but we continue to see Willy, the released orca, playing a heroic role in saving several other animals after an oil spill resulting from an accident with a tanker that passed too close to the shore. Of course, as it is predictable in a film like this, there is life danger to the orcas, but in the end, everything goes well.\r\n\r\nThe script really ends up depending on each person's ability to turn off their brain and watch the film without asking questions. On the one hand, we are dealing with an orca whose release was amateurish, unforeseen and unprepared, as we saw in the opening film. In addition to this being something that goes against all the basic norms of those who deal with these animals, it increases the chances that a wild animal simply does not want its freedom, preferring the human contact it is already used to. It would help to understand how Jesse and Willy's relationship continues to be strong and important in this film, and the film that would follow.\r\n\r\nHowever, believing that the orca could hear Jesse's harmonica, even if it were far away, is as foolish as believing in Santa Claus, and is simply forgetting that these animals travel thousands of miles, and that the orca is one of the few marine mammals that can be seen in any sea in the world. Willy would never hear the sound of his friend's harmonica if he was that far away. And although the film touches on an important ecological and environmental point \u2013 the damage caused by oil spills \u2013 the way it does so is far from realistic. Oil spills are a serious matter, they mobilize a lot of technicians and there are specific ways to contain and clean them up, as well as to save the affected marine life. A bunch of amateurs just couldn't do much.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the logic problems and holes in the script, the film has some very underwritten characters, although some of the heavy clich\u00e9s of the initial film have been polished. And it is still pleasant to see the most important faces of the initial film return: Jason James Ritcher continues to work well as Jesse and is well supported by Michael Madson and August Schellenberg, who also return to the characters they already know. Francis Capra is doing very well, and Mary Kate Schellhart does what she can with the material she's been given.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film continues to bet heavily on good cinematography and the choice of beautiful filming locations. As with its predecessor, it's a film that doesn't look the age it already is, and if we saw it without knowing when it was released, we wouldn't give it more than ten years. Good sound effects, good special effects, a realistic and effective animatronic whale, are some of the values that this film presents to us and that deserve a positive note. The soundtrack is pleasant, skillfully recycling material from the early film."], [], ["This is what happens when the Greenwich Village crowd tries to remake and rewrite a classic. The B&W adds a nostalgic touch, but even Peter Fonda, or the lesbian love scene, can't save this one from the bottom of the heap. The ONLY redeeming quality the film has, is that it is a Non-Christmas Christmas movie and makes one of my lists, albeit it's now the last place movie of that list."], ["Good enough of a watch, might watch again, but can't honestly recommend.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem is just that the movie is dated.  The entire movie is based off a fear mongering joke/concept that our lives are controlled by computers, which in 1995 wasn't really the case, but in 2020 is much more true in the way that the movie wants to say.\r\n\r\nWhat actually makes the movie is that the movie isn't centered on manipulating the information, but uses it as adversity that the protagonist can overcome.\r\n\r\nEssentially this comes down to a \"average person\" in a \"spy movie\" trope.  I think puzzle fans will like this one as it is a lot of \"If X and Y, then what do you do?\".  And we know Sandra Bullock doesn't shy away from a little action."], ["**A sci-fi dystopia with a good political conspiracy plot in a film that cinema preferred to forget.**\r\n\r\nI think I've seen at least twenty films about the Millennium where times are shown with great pessimism. In this specific case, the end of the millennium is a time of social and political chaos, in which society moves without a clear direction, given over to fleeting pleasures and criminal acts. And in the midst of all the dissolution of morals and values, a mechanism emerges that allows the recording of the memories and sensations of the person who uses it, leading to a black market in illicit recordings of crimes, sex and controversial acts: thus, a man who never stole, killed or cheated on his wife can experience all of this without necessarily having to do so. But what happens when a recording keeps evidence of a murder?\r\n\r\nThe film has qualities, and presents a story that mixes sci-fi, political thriller and a little romance, in a mix that has aged very well, even though we are now firmly into the millennium. The project began around 1985, and is one of the few results of the partnership (professional and loving) between Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron. He had the ideas for the script, and she assures us of the elegant direction, the impactful and suitably dark cinematography, effective visual and special effects and a costume and set design strongly influenced by punk and metal aesthetics. The film was named after a song by the \u201cDoors\u201d, and was a huge critical and commercial failure. Therefore, everyone involved preferred to forget it.\r\n\r\nI can't help but consider the oblivion as unfair: it's not a perfect film, the story is too complex, it seems too stilted, like a hot air balloon, and it's excessively long (less than thirty minutes of dead scenes would have made things more dynamic). However, it is an immersive film that addresses, in some depth, people's appreciation for superficial pleasures and ways to escape a cruel and oppressive reality. This is still a very topical issue, as is the whole plot surrounding excessive police violence. And finally, I need to highlight the quality of the \u201cfirst person\u201d footage, when the mechanism is used, and we see things through the character's eyes.\r\n\r\nRalph Fiennes gives us one of the most complex and interesting dramatic works of his career, making the most of his character's multiplicity of contradictory feelings and emotions. Angela Bassett also shone in this film, in an intense and action-packed role. Juliette Lewis does a pretty decent job, especially when she sings, but I can't help but consider that the actress's nudity is somewhat gratuitous and exaggerated, perhaps to sexualize the character. Michael Wincott is an effective villain."], ["Although it often crosses over into stereotype and sentimentality, this film is made likeable by its fabulous cast. Vida (Patrick Swayze) and Noxeema (Wesley Snipes) are co-winners in a New York drag queen contest. They win a trip to Hollywood to compete in a national pageant. Taking pity on drag queen in training Chi-Chi (John Leguizamo), they sell the two plane tickets and buy a Cadillac convertible and drive cross country. They have a run-in with hick sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn), and Vita thinks she has killed him after he discovers her male identity. The car breaks down somewhere in the Midwest, and the trio must wait a weekend before the part can be ordered. In the meantime, they integrate themselves into the small town, solving everyone's problems, and giving the place a little pizzazz.\r\n\r\nThere are points in this film where my eyes rolled. No one in the town knows these three are men dressed in women's clothing. The dumb hick routine has been done before, and this film does not add anything. Vita, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi all have a heightened sense of fashion, have been rejected by their families, and can only rely on each other. Dollard is an insensitive bigot hunting the three down after being laughed at by other law enforcement officers. He is also a cliche, although Penn's scene in the bar talking about a man getting it on with another man is the highlight of the film. Despite all the stock characters, I am still recommending the film. Sure, the characters have been done before, but I still liked them all, even the villainous Dollard. The small town is populated by extremely good acting talent like Stockard Channing, Blythe Danner, Melinda Dillon, and Jeremy London, and that adds to the film. The writers never degenerate into the visiting trio trying to cover up the fact that they are men through weak slapstick or goofball chase scenes. After a while, I forgot Snipes, Swayze, and Leguizamo were actors dressed like women. There are no instances where the three \"slip up\" and reveal they are men, like \"Tootsie\" or \"Some Like It Hot,\" and I am not faulting those films for that. Those films had straight men forced to dress like women. Here, Vita, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi make no secret of their love for men, and don't care what others believe of them- unless they could get physically hurt in the process. The title of the film refers to an autographed photograph the trio takes with them, turning it into their shrine and reason for going on. With cameos by Robin Williams, RuPaul, and the actual Julie Newmar, I found I enjoyed \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar\" more than I probably should have. But like the three ladies, I just did not care."], ["This is the very 1st Adam Sandler movie I ever seen. I was dying with laughter throughout this movie. Now I'm a hugh Adam Sandler fan. Stop looking at me swan."], ["Over the years, I have really enjoyed Smith's comic book writing, but this is the only film so far I have seen him direct. My cinephilic friends tend to dismiss his recent works, but this was very enjoyable. I like the influence he has had on independent cinema. 1994 certainly proved to be an important year for it, with the smash successes that independent studios had with 'Clerks' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I hope he sticks to directing films that he himself writes. I have the feeling he wants to expand his horizons but isn't quite sure how to go about it without alienating his huge fanbase. I have great confidence in him, and feel that if he puts his heart into it, he can be a great filmmaker, instead of a good one. I think for him to do so, he could do himself a great service and read a few less comic books and watch a lot more movies, particularly by the Hollywood greats from the Golden Age, such as Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Raoul Walsh and John Ford. It would be quite exciting to see what he comes up with, once his creative juices are recharged.", "Quite a controversial movie, I would say, yet the very one from all by Kevin Smith I actually like. Not for those below-the-belt jokes but this lowlife vibe most of us lost on the halfway to adult life.

The times when the bare minimum seemed to be a freedom and the only thing one needs to be satisfied with their life.", "**A rude but understandable film.**\r\n\r\nI just saw this film, and honestly I was hoping for a slightly different comedy, with a more elaborate, more conventional structure and not based so much on endless dialogues. It is, however, an independent film, made a little outside of what traditional circuits and big studios are, and the budget is limited. If we consider all this, I think we can understand the film better.\r\n\r\nThe film basically accompanies a day in the life of two commercial employees who hate their jobs but need them, like any mortal. They work closely together and are friends, but the day promises not to be easy for either of them. The film is based on jokes of a very rude nature, sometimes also on the inelegant manners of the characters. There are a lot of allusions to pop culture throughout the movie as well, and I didn't always get that. It's not the kind of humor I really enjoy, though the film has its moments. Perhaps this style of humor works better with young people and teenagers than with someone more adult...\r\n\r\nThe cast features a number of actors that I don't really know. Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson had their most relevant work in this film, from what I've seen. The film is quite restrained in terms of costumes and scenery, and I believe that real stores were used for the production. What can be considered a weakness, the low budget, was to some extent an advantage, taking into account the type of film they preferred to make here. The cinematography is very good and well used, and is perhaps the film's most artistic feature."], [], ["Welcome to Maine; where alcoholism, smoking, and all sorts of behavior the aforementioned are trying to cover up creep up on you like bad filling of gravy. At least, in Stephen King\u2019s universe. True to his (excessive) words, a lot gets stirred up, not all of it gets answered, and characters  get knee high in lots of details. Nothing wrong about that, except in this movie the details, and the melodrama that comes with them, tend to bog down what should be bonding of two women over the men that hurt them. What a depressingly masculine mess.\r\n\r\nI love a good pulpy environment (hello film noir, which often has a mystery element to it like this movie) but someone how the pacing was just off. I think Kathy Bates does a pretty fantastic job as the the title character. Her daughter Selena though.. I don\u2019t know if it meant more in the book but her talks about the story in Arizona she wants to cover doesn\u2019t really anything interesting to the mix. Maybe it\u2019s to show what bad decisions she\u2019s made after having no family to turn to, but it\u2019s belaboured. We get she\u2019s a emotional mess without it. I also don\u2019t think Jennifer Jason Leigh is all that great in the role, but then again she mostly just sits there to reveal plot points and be something Dolores scarified for. She\u2019s a talking macguffin.\r\nMuch more interesting is the relationship between Dolores and Det. Mackey, played gravely by Christopher Plummer. Oh, and that odd looking John C. Riley as his deputy. His face always livens everything up. There\u2019s a bit of destructive perfectionist streak in Mackey, wanting to close the book on the case he never solves to his satisfaction. At some points this runs into cop drama play by play (including  a[albeit mercifully short] courtroom scene. Were 90\u2019s Hollywood films required to have those in at least one scene?), but it helped by little details, like throwing a full piss pan at the other.\r\n\r\nBut whose piss was that? Why the fermenting yellow liquid of Vera, a women we seem to think Dolores killed. We know that\u2019s not true though, any two who exchange such old fashioned zingers (\u201cDolores, I insist that all women who have hysterics in my drawing room call me by my Christian name.\u201d)  and share body fluids can\u2019t hate each other. Maybe with only one, but both? Nay. Besides, it\u2019s much more fun to tag team to doom a alcoholic sexual predator. Her husband; Am I spoiling anything by saying she did kill him? Then it would only be 95% special victims unit, not totally. Might as well cook up all that gravy, a full crock.\r\nThis does lead to two defining  moments for Dolores. The log back rub to milk cranium massage is pretty good vicious, but mere flower play before the eclipse.  After finding Joe has been stealing from her (by proxy of having a penis and the bank therefore believing his bullshit) and abusing a young Selena she plays to stuff him down a well, when everyone is watching the sun black out. This scene is certainly memorable, if not only for the almost baroque visual style (lot of key light) but where she seems to set an olympic record for long jumping, right over the hole. Frankly, this should have been the ending, it\u2019s Dolores best movement, and since she really sets the stage for everyone else to ladle out in, it\u2019s a wonderfully creepy way out. Instead we wait another quarter of a film to pass by.\r\n\r\nAnything not Dolores tends to be too congested to be found appetizing. I wage she was more of  the center of attention originally, and the other parts were attempting to give the actors more to do, or give more speaking time to the men. This is dubious; King material tends to be overripe as it is, but imitation King (as practiced by director Taylor Hackford and writer Tony Gilroy) is even more stagy. Fine, she helped her daughter, who recognizes it nearly twenty years later, and she amused an entertaining old lady. But the real Dolores, and where Bates is at her best, wrapped all the pain she took from an abusive husband, and leaped over to stomp down someone who hurt her young, like a fierce chicken. A little more strut, a little more pecking, and we would have a fine character study between her and her golden egg. Guess you take what you can get, and go on with your day, especially in Maine.", "This one tends to get ignored when people consider the 'classic' Stephen King film adaptations (the first 20 years), but it's very subtle, nuanced, and is basically one of King's finest and more mature works. If it was even possible for Kathy Bates to out-do her Oscar-winning work in 'Misery', she still did so, and nailed it. I'm a huge fan of John C. Reilly, Eric Bogosian (why 'Talk Radio is my favourite Oliver Stone movie and 'Under Siege 2' my favourite Steven Seagal film), David Strathairn, Christopher Plummer and especially, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and the Tony Gilroy script serves them beautifully.\r\n\r\nUnfairly, I tend to joke about director Taylor HACKford, but it just may be that he's a more contemporary model of such versatile directors from the past as Norman Jewison and Robert Wise. That's fairly esteemed company--and here, he abides himself quite nicely in some of his best work.", "Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto.\r\n\r\nDolores Claiborne is directed by Taylor Hackford and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Strathairn, John C. Riley, Christopher Plummer and Judy Parfitt. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain.\r\n\r\nPlot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena's father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present.\r\n\r\nA terrifically well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family's roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly.\r\n\r\nThe structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer's weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward - the latter of which is nearly unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours. However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan whom wants some intelligent emotional heft in the screenplay. 8/10"], [], ["The best psychological drama I've seen in a long time. I can't even remember anything that comes close.", "**Something abstract and disconnected, not worth seeing more than once in our life.**\r\n\r\nThis is one of those films that puts such a huge barrier between the audience and the screen that it seems like we're not even being taken into consideration by the producers. Despite the attempts, there is not a single sympathetic or palatable character, the script does not help and the feeling that hangs in the air is of a lack of connection and solidity in the final product that can only be explained if we think about the way the director wanted to be. abstract by force.\r\n\r\nEverything takes place around a chic striptease club, Exotica, in Toronto. There is a dancer who enchants not only a client who goes to see her every day, but also the presenter, who is her ex-boyfriend and one of the most possessive and unhappy people we can imagine. Add to this an animal trafficker with problems admitting homosexuality who is forced to participate in a revenge plan, and we have a film that we probably won't want to see more than once.\r\n\r\nAtom Egoyan gives us firm direction, but a much less secure and solid script. I like the way it addresses loss, trauma, the feeling of denial of reality and grief. However, to believe that a woman would set up an elegant strip club and her daughter would have the courage to take over the \u201cfamily business\u201d is to completely ignore the realities of these commercial establishments, where legality and illegality sometimes go hand in hand. A real luxury house would never hold private sessions on tables in the main room for a low price, but in separate rooms for a much higher price, and real strippers don't usually dance to the same music and use the same stage number constantly. There are also huge holes that the script never explains and that are left hanging. For example, why did Christina decide to become a stripper if it is clear, from the characters' words, that that is not the place she deserved to be.\r\n\r\nBruce Greenwood is the actor who deserves the most praise for his work here. He is the only one trying to break the ice and reach out to the public in some way, and that deserves an applause from us. Elias Koteas is not that good, but he also does work that can be considered positive. Mia Kirshner, on the other hand, seems to be disinterested and just trying to make some money without much effort. Don McKellar is no better, and Arsin\u00e9e Khanjian has an absolutely ill-conceived and poorly made character.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, it is an uninteresting film, to say the least. It is within the range of what one would expect to find in a film with aspirations to be commercial, but which seems to be more popular with festivals and film cycles than with the mass public. The positive highlight is the design of the strip club scene, something tropical I would say, and the soundtrack, which includes a good song by Leonard Cohen."], ["**A sincere tribute to the man and his work, full of bizarreness, humor, artificial octopuses and angora.**\r\n\r\nI've been wanting to see this for a while now, and the opportunity finally came. Very intelligently directed by Tim Burton, it is a brief biography that honors Ed Wood, reckoned as the worst director Hollywood has ever known (although that title is disputed by other more recent directors).\r\n\r\nI already knew Ed Wood's work, I've seen one or two of his films, and I can guarantee that his fame is justified: the films are the most amateurish imaginable and the number of errors and problems is such that even the general public saw the director's inability and na\u00efvet\u00e9. I won't dwell on this point, just add that this film covers the filming of \u201cGlenn or Glenda\u201d, \u201cBride of the Monster\u201d and \u201cPlan 9 from Outer Space\u201d. As is typical of Burton's films, there is a certain amount of bizarreness which makes the most sincere homage to Ed Wood's work. One notices, implicitly, a certain sympathy or admiration for the director, who never achieved fame (at least, positive) and to whom success has eluded. He is a man with a vision and a dream, but without any ability to achieve it and who, even so, never gave up.\r\n\r\nJohnny Depp was a smart choice for the protagonist. The actor likes unusual roles and portrayed Wood in a very faithful way, emphasizing his incorrigible and absolutely blind optimism, as well as his habit of dressing like a woman and the problems that caused him in being taken seriously. There is, in the character, a certain bizarre fetish about angora fabrics that I don't know if it was real, but it fit very well. I also really liked Martin Landau, a very respectable veteran who fit wonderfully into the role of Bela Lugosi, the mythical horror actor who was forgotten by the industry towards the end of his life and succumbed to morphine addiction and depression, and Lisa Marie, who played Maila Nurmi, Finnish actress famous for her character Vampira. Sarah Jessica Parker also did an impeccable job as Wood's girlfriend. Jeffrey Jones does a good job as Criswell, a fake psychic famous for his TV appearances. Bill Murray appears little, but does a decent job whenever asked.\r\n\r\nThe film was very well shot in black and white, and I believe this fit better with the spirit of the film, and the way it was designed. There is a beautiful limpidity and the cinematography is very crafted and stylistically rich. The film plays a lot with the difficulties that Wood encountered in filming and promoting his films, and the total amateurism with which he did so, and this is funny and, at the same time, moving. The sets and costumes are excellent, convincing, and the reproduction of the films was well done and honors the originals. The soundtrack, written by Howard Shore, does the rest and gives the film a bizarrely delicious tone. Finally, a word about the opening and ending of the film, in a style magnificently suited to cheap horror productions of the time."], ["That all-consuming drive towards being a professional athlete eats away at two inner-city Chicago boys and their families. And yet, they still find time to celebrate the little victories along the way, keeping this film from diving too much into an exploration in futility, and more of a life-affirming exploration of the nature of dreams."], [], ["(As I'm writing this review, Darth Vader's theme music begins to build in my mind...)\r\n\r\nWell, it actually has a title, what the Darth Vader theme. And that title is \"The Imperial March\", composed by the great John Williams, whom, as many of you may already know, also composed the theme music for \"Jaws\" - that legendary score simply titled, \"Main Title (Theme From Jaws)\".\r\n\r\nNow, with that lil' bit of trivia aside, let us procede with the fabled film currently under review: Star Wars. It had been at a drive-in theater in some small Illinois town or other where my mother, my older brother, and I had spent our weekly \"Movie Date Night\" watching this George Lucas directed cult masterpiece from our car in the parking lot. On the huge outdoor screen, the film appeared to be a silent one, but thanks to an old wire-attached speaker, we were able to hear both the character dialogue and soundtrack loud and clear. We even had ourselves a carful of vittles and snacks - walked back to our vehicle, of course, from the wide-opened cinema's briefly distant concession stand. Indeed, it had been a lovely summer evening that July.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the film started, with my brother and I following along as our mother sped-read the opening crawl, I began to feel rather antsy, thinking that this movie, the first in a franchise that would soon be world-renowned, was going to be boring, due to its genre being Science Fiction: A respectably likable, but not a passionately lovable genre of mine DURING THAT TIME. I just didn't believe I was going to like Star Wars all that much ... But I soon found myself intrigued ... And awed.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lucas is a man with a phenomenal, and I do mean phenomenal imagination. Apart from his human characters (Han, Luke, Leia, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, among others), the droids: C-3P0, R2-D2, R2-series, and IG-88, not to mention those unusual characters like Jabba the Hutt, Yoda, and Chewbacca, just to name a few, are all creations of Lucas's phenomenal imagination. And I was completely in awe of each one of these strange beings. Then there was Vader ... And the evil Emperor ... And the Stormtroopers ... And the Spacecraft ... And the galaxies (I'll admit that I am a huge lover of the Universe in all its Celestial glory) ... And the magnificent planets ... The Lightsabers ... And so on. Star Wars is a gorgeously shot space opera; it is truly an epic masterpiece. We enjoyed this film tremendously. And my brother was a die-hard fan from that night onward. He, my brother, had even received for Christmas that year, nearly every Star Wars action figure that my mother could find, including two of the spacecraft: The Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer. The Death Star space station had too been wrapped beneath our Christmas tree - tagged with his name. It was totally crazy, what the new Star Wars era. Frenzied! But it was great ... Even still, to this day.\r\n\r\nI don't personally know anyone whom has yet to see Star Wars, but that certainly doesn't suggest there are still a few people out there who haven't. And if you're one of the latter, then you should know that this classic space opera comes highly recommended. The entire series is told backwards, so you'll definitely want to see Star Wars first, followed by its two sequels: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi ... In that order. I trust that you'll too discover yourself to be a lifelong cult fan in the wake. \ud83d\ude0a", "A long time ago in a childhood not too far away...\r\n\r\nPrincess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben \"Obi-Wan\" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.\r\n\r\nBack in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.\r\n\r\nAs the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.\r\n\r\nIt is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10", "Star Wars (1977) is a true masterpiece of cinema, and is \r\n  definitely one of the best films ever made.\r\n\r\nFor me Star Wars (1977) is the best movie of all time,tied with The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Star Wars (1977) it is for sure the most iconic film of all time everything in it is iconic. The direction, the script, the performances in this film are brilliant, all the characters are captivating and well developed. \r\n\r\nAnyway, this is a totally perfect film, I only have praise for it, it is certainly a masterpiece of cinema, and my grade for it is 10\\10.", "A quality start to the franchise.\r\n\r\nI say start, I guess that depends on the (seemingly) controversial way of watching these films - I've decided on release order, so it's the beginning for me anyway. I've heard a lot about <em>'Star Wars'</em> so I am expecting big things, this didn't disappoint whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI unquestionably enjoyed this! If I didn't know this was released in 1977 I would never have guessed, it still holds up astonishingly well. The special effects are spectacular for the vast, vast majority; even the stuff that perhaps hasn't aged as supremely still looks superb.\r\n\r\nThe cast are a joy. I actually wouldn't say any performance sensationally stood out, but all the actors and all the characters are so much fun to watch together. Mark Hamill is impressive as Luke, Harrison Ford is entertaining as Han and Carrie Fisher is super as Leia. Credit also to James Earl Jones and Alec Guinness, among others. Despite not watching until now, I literally already knew all of the character names - shows how timeless these are.\r\n\r\nThe plot makes for top notch viewing, I found the pacing to be particularly spot on. And how about that score? Stupendous! I really have no negatives for this, I'm sure it isn't perfect but I had a very fun time with it.", "Everyone and their mother is going to write reviews about the Star Wars movies...and this one, this one actually came out before I was born.\r\n\r\nIt breaks the heart. I had to wait until the re-release before I got to see this one on the big screen. This is the one that ruined my Star Wars opening night streak...\r\n\r\n...Well The Force Awakens ALMOST ruined it further. I had to drive out to my parents house just to see it, for the sake of tradition, and when I got there they had already gone without me...twice.\r\n\r\nSome angry words later and I guilted my mom, pointing out the drive, to force her into a third go.\r\n\r\nBut that is neither here nor there.\r\n\r\nThis was the movie that started it all. And the first time I saw it, it was on Beta. Once upon a time my family had the movie in Beta. And then I had the trilogy in VHS. And then I had it on DVD. And it is going to repeat like that as the mediums change.\r\n\r\nIts one of those movies that you have to own, even as technology changes. It is actually one of those movies you want to buy right away when the technology changes, just to see it in better and better quality.\r\n\r\nThat should be saying something right there. But for a lot of you its not.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of you, it is a fairy tale in space, complete with knights and old wizards and a princess. Only its a fairy tale in space made for, well, made for nerds like me.\r\n\r\nIt is a legend and the type of legend that stays with people and makes old Gen-Xers like me, cynical and grumpy, feel like little kids again.\r\n\r\nIt, along with the Godfather, is the type of movie that breeds mental spousal abuse as generations of men force their wives at gunpoint to watch them...and then get confused and a little depressed when most of them don't see the fascination with them.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Godfather, however, its the movie that fathers force their children to watch and, then, their children carry the love for it into the next generation.\r\n\r\nStar Wars is an endless cycle, even the bad ones are good. And the fans create endless theories about them. They buy the t-shirts, the buy the toys, they do everything they can to preserve that love and pass it on.\r\n\r\nA New Hope, this is the film that started all of that, and though there are better installments, this will always be the first.", "Thinking back to the films that define my generation; I recall queuing round the cinema as an excited 10 year old for two hours waiting to see this film. I wonder how many people could say that they have done that in the last 20 years? This film is a truly groundbreaking piece of formative cinema. Leaving aside the magnificent special effects; this is a film about good and evil; empire, freedom and democracy and of their true characterisations. It has a slightly stilted script (particularly from Sir Alec Guinness) but that is more than offset by a fabulous John Williams' score and the hugely engaging performances of Hamill, Fisher and Ford with undoubtedly the best baddie cinema has ever seen in \"Darth Vader\". Truly a wonderful watch."], ["_**Similar to \u201cA River Runs through It\u201d but more heroic and melodramatic**_\r\n\r\nNear the close of the 19th Century, a disillusioned Army Colonel (Anthony Hopkins) sets up a ranch in remote western Montana with his Cree friend, One Stab (Gordon Tootoosis). He nurtures a family of a wife & three boys, plus his loyal personnel. One son is sensible and \u201cfollows the rules (Aidan Quinn) while another is wild and well-versed in Cree traditions (Brad Pitt). After a harrowing involvement in WW1, the two brothers go separate ways during the Prohibition Era of the 20s and early 30s. Julia Ormond and Karina Lombard are on hand in the feminine department.      \r\n\r\n\"Legends of the Fall\" (1994) is similar to \u201cA River Runs through It\u201d from two years prior. Pitt basically plays the same character, just exaggerated here. Where these movies differ is the earlier one was based on Norman Maclean\u2019s memoir and is therefore thoroughly realistic whereas \u201cLegends\u201d was based on James Harrison\u2019s book and has a larger-than-life vibe. Like that earlier film, \u201cLegends\u201d effectively brings to life the era with its Model T's and bootlegging of alcoholic beverages. \r\n\r\nWhile I give the edge to \u201cA River Runs through It,\u201d this one ain\u2019t no slouch. It begins mundane and tedious with AmerIndian mumbo jumbo (I\u2019m talking about the eye-rolling spiritual gobbledygook, e.g. the \u201cwild spirit of the bear\u201d), but picks up when the boys go to Europe to fight. Like \u201cA River Runs through It,\u201d this is a character study of two contrasting souls, both generally likable and noble, but one functions successfully within the box of society whereas the other cannot be contained in this box.\r\n\r\nAlthough neither trips my trigger much, Ormond is very attractive and Lombard is stunning. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, \u201cLegends\u201d is a well-done artistic Western that takes place in the early 20th Century with commentary on the masculine nature, duty, bravery, death, love, rivalry, commitment or lack of commitment, searching for meaning, familial altercations, following the rules, living \u201cfree,\u201d tragedy, acceptance, forgiveness and honor. It\u2019s simply about life and every family will be able to relate, one way or another.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 13 minutes, and was shot in Alberta, Canada (Ghost River, Morley & Calgary), and Vancouver, British Columbia (the Helena scenes), as well as Ocho Rios, St. Ann, Jamaica (the exotic scenes).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"], ["As monarchs go, King George is of the better kind. He's gruff and has annoying quirks, but he cares for people and country. He's neither a cruel tyrant, nor a wasteful peacock - which the prince is.\r\n\r\nTrouble is, King George is not well any more. In his head. What we can diagnose to be likely porphyria today, was simply madness back then.\r\n\r\nThe Madness of King George has its aspects of tragedy, family drama, intrigue, comedy; but always present are the reflections about politics, power, monarchy and what it is, can be, should be (and whether at all).\r\n\r\nIt presents itself as a period piece, but written as a theatre play in 1994, it is at the same time a contemporary deliberation, with some jibes and jokes about things which seem to never change... in the UK, at least.\r\n\r\nViewers in The Colonies might enjoy it as well.\r\n\r\nI sure did, not least because of the great Nigel Hawthorne, who won the Best Leading Actor BAFTA for this, and plays Mr. King in a very touching way. The not-only-supporting cast is both well known, and gives excellent performances throughout.\r\n\r\nVery much recommended, if the genre doesn't put you off.", "A little like Keith Michell in \"Henry VIII and his Six Wives\"; this was a role Nigel Hawthorne had perfected earlier (he won an Olivier award for the stage play) and so he took to the cinematic version like a duck to water. This telling of his \"madness\" is superb - ably reflecting the unpredictable and vacillating behaviour of the King in a plausible and engaging manner. Rupert Everett, Helen Mirren and Ian Holm lead a very capable supporting cast and the incorporation of Handel's wonderful, rousing, Georgian themes adds to this sumptuous, if at times a little overly theatrical, production."], ["**A brutal criticism of our society, in which the film itself takes advantage of what it is criticizing.**\r\n\r\nOliver Stone is not one of my favorite directors. What happens when he teams up with Quentin Tarantino? This. The script written by Tarantino is an authentic carnage that massacred not only a random number of extras but also popular culture.\r\n\r\nEver since the mass media appeared, alarmist and high-sounding voices have occasionally emerged to warn of the enormous dangers they pose. Over the decades, criticism has echoed around the appreciation for what is violent or has sexual connotations. I agree with some, if not most, of the criticisms, although I cannot accept people being considered stupid enough to start carrying out massacres or sexual orgies just because of what they see on certain TV shows. The vast majority of people do not allow themselves to be influenced in this way, and those who allow this already have, a priori, an imperative need for psychological support.\r\n\r\nThe film starts from this premise to create a bizarre story in which a terrible couple of killers, bloodthirsty and sadistic to an extreme point, end up being transformed into authentic \u201cpop\u201d superstars, with legions of fans, interviews and a public frenzy around them. their violent acts, and the heartless hunt that the police carry out against them. I appreciate the satirical tones given to the film, which shows a society where everything that in a normal world only deserves to be execrated is worshiped. However, by taking this path, it is part of the \u201cproblem\u201d and is so extremely violent that it bothers any human being with a minimum of compassion.\r\n\r\nEverything in this film has Tarantino's touch, implicit in a latent hysteria present in almost everything: the direction is raw, rude, the soundtrack is intrusive, and the editing uses brutal, fast cuts and scenes that an epileptic would not be able to handle, including sudden cuts of black-and-white films, TV news and other materials. The visual effects are of excellent quality, but eye-catching. The fast-paced action transforms the film into a race through a world of extreme violence, histrionic and unpleasant characters, and incessant noise. The dialogue is written to be shouted rather than spoken, and the heavy use of swear words may make some people's ears ring.\r\n\r\nThere is a very strong cast in this film that deserves to be highlighted for the superb work it gives to the audience. Woody Harrelson is convincing and appropriately sadistic in his role, which is one of the most brutal and impactful of his career to date, and Juliette Lewis, despite not being particularly \u201csexy\u201d as required by the character, is believable, intelligent and pleasantly naughty. Robert Downey Jr., who was still far from the stardom he achieved in recent years, is truly devastating in the final part of the film and Tommy Lee Jones, an always competent veteran, is suitably crazy, as if he no longer has a sense of reality and had no fear of abusing the powers with which he was invested. Tom Sizemore ends up being the most restrained actor among those that the script most favored.", "I am a little suspect to talk about of this one - was on my bucket list for ages and finally I could see the director's cult version of it. It simply wasn't anything that I was expecting... and it was way more. Normally this would be a 3 star max, but I took in account the movie editing and the 30y gap.\r\n\r\nMaybe if I watched it 30y ago it would be a different sense - it deal with the over glorification of serial killers by (old - and now we have again that trend) media shows and that many serial killers have difficult family backgrounds  with child abuse (but not all turn to killers and ice-versa, I think the main dialog here is about mental disease in the family).\r\n\r\nIf no one said to me that it was Oliver Stone Behind the camera's simply I couldn't tell. It looked simply a Tarantino movie, and guess what? The screenplay was of him, and \"heavily\" (?!) edited by Oliver Stone.\r\n\r\nSorry for the fans but I am not one of the Tarantino Movies, they rely too much in violence and puns to hide little if any talent for screenplays. I expected way more of the screenplay after Oliver Stone revised it.\r\n\r\nSome aspects of the movie can be said positive: the acting of the Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis) as a modern version of Bonnie and Clyde and Robert Downey Jr. as the show presenter.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography by the talentful Robert Richardson (that works constantly with Tarantino, but with other huge names as Scorsese and Oliver Stone himself) is frenetic and psychedelic and so is the editing that is huge in between scenes, done by Hank Corwin and Brian Berdan (Tree of Life, Don't Look Up, Vice, etc) and the music score is perfect by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails (especially Cowboy Junkies \"Sweet Jane\" and Jane's Addiction ones).\r\n\r\nOtherwise even the tone of violence is just comic by today standards - but the visual of the killer couple is very aesthetic and some scenes like the opeding and the wedding ones. \r\n\r\nI would give it a 7.0 out of 10.0 / B"], ["***Scarier than any horror flick \u2014 and ultra-suspenseful***  \r\n\r\nAfter a deadly incurable African virus is brought to a Northern California coastal town via a monkey the military moves in to quarantine the village. While Dustin Hoffman seeks to find an antidote, the two generals in charge of the quarantine (Morgan Freeman & Donald Sutherland) strangely decide to annihilate the town. Can Hoffman find a cure in time? And, even if he does, can he stop the firebombing?\r\n\r\nWolfgang Petersen's \"Outbreak\" (1995) is an outstanding drama/thriller, which I suppose you could designate as a disaster flick. Although viruses are so small they're invisible, they have the potential to be the biggest monsters of all. Certain deadly viruses, if let loose, can wipe out an entire town in a couple days. This is the scenario in \"Outbreak.\" It COULD happen and is therefore realistic, which naturally makes the story more horrifying than most horror flicks or monster movies.\r\n\r\nBut \"Outbreak\" is more than just a scary what-if story, the second half involves a military cover-up and is edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, all the way to the final minutes. It's like an avalanche that slowly builds momentum.\r\n\r\nCuba Gooding Jr. is also on hand in a significant role as Hoffman's partner in the race-against-time. And, for those who care, there's a romantic subplot about Hoffman\u2019s character and his ex-wife, played by Rene Russo. Will they get back together?\r\n\r\nThe locations are magnificent, filmed in the coastal towns Eureka, Arcata and Ferndale, California, all in the extreme Northern part of the state, just south of the Redwoods and West of Bigfoot territory (i.e. Willow Creek). The African sequences were shot in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: This is top-of-the-line cinema \u2014 equal parts scary, dramatic and suspenseful.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-", "I found this a far better disaster-scenario movie then most, as Dustin Hoffman plays a military doctor on the hunt for the source of a lethal virus that could potentially eradicate life in the USA in a matter of days. Hoffman has to convince his boss - Morgan Freeman and his boss Donald Sutherland that he is up to the job and after a few false leads is soon on the trail of an African monkey that may hold the solution. Denied sufficient resource from the Army, he enlists the help of ex-wife (and expert in disease control Rene Russo) to help him grapple with his predicament.The story is tautly delivered with Sutherland rather good as the slightly unhinged general whose almost \"nuke 'em\" strategy leads for an uncomfortably strained relationship with the scientist. There is a smattering of plausible science and plenty of action - Cuba Gooding Jr. is his sort of \"Mr. T\" sidekick and Kevin Spacey and Patrick Dempsey add a bit of collateral too. Given the April 2020 Covid-19 situation, \"Outbreak\" has an added poignancy as to just how simply these things could occur!"], ["HOW TO MAKE A FEMALE ASSASSIN. TRAUMA, TRAINING THEN GET HER EXTRA ANGRY.  NATILIE PORTMANS FIRST ASSASSIN ROLE AND HOPEFULLY NOT HER LAST.  WE NEED A PART 2 TO THIS MOVIE.", "This films stars a 12-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda, a girl living with her abusive stepfather, a step-sister, mother, and four-year old brother. She doesn\u2019t care for any of these people except her brother. One day, she returns home from getting the groceries to find corrupt DEA agents have killed her entire family. Key amongst those agents is Stansfield, played by Gary Oldman. Seeking refuge in the flat of a neighbour she had befriended earlier, L\u00e9on (Jean Reno), she learns that he is a hitman. She makes a deal with him: she will look after the flat by doing the domestic chores if he will teach her how to get revenge on the men who killed her brother.\r\n\r\nStrange though the synopsis may be, the relationship between L\u00e9on and Mathilda is kept innocent, and the scenes between the two are believable. Mathilda\u2019s sexual awareness is at a nascent stage and her exposure to the sordid side of life with her recently deceased family (her step-father worked for drug-dealers) means she is perhaps not as innocent as most 12-year old girls; however, L\u00e9on is unwilling to take advantage of the situation. This means the story can focus on the platonic relationship between the two, the bond that develops between them, and how each affects the other\u2019s life.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may seem a little far-fetched that a young girl would accompany a hitman during his work, L\u00e9on ensures that her assistance is required only on fairly routine hits that follow a well-defined pattern. For the more complex hits he leaves her behind.\r\n\r\nThere is a thread of humour running through the film, but you must bear in mind the film is framed in the world of corruption and greed and all is not sweet and light, and graphic violence is depicted.\r\n\r\nJean Reno is wonderful as the extremely good but placid hitman, whose whole outlook on life is changed by the young Mathilda, played wonderfully by Natalie Portman in her first film. I\u2019ve not read it, but I understand that Eppie has a similar effect on Silas Marner, as described in the book of the same name. I found Gary Oldman\u2019s performance histrionic, the only let-down in the film, albeit not something that spoilt the film as a whole.\r\n\r\nRecommended."], ["***The cream of the crop of quirky crime thrillers***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1994 and written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, \"Pulp Fiction\" is a drama/thriller/black comedy about two hit men in Los Angeles (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).\r\n\r\nThe lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it's easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue's witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film's stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90's films and beyond.\r\n\r\nI put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with 'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let \u2019em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film's worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it's a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God\u2019s grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn\u2019t and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout.\r\n\r\nBoth Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can't go wrong with \"Pulp Fiction.\" It's top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM WAS SHOT in the Greater Los Angeles area. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Roger Avary.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A", "Insane movie! \r\nOne of the bests(if not the best) Tarantino's movies!", "Ving Rhames (\"Wallace\") is the kingpin who provides the loosest of templates for a couple of inter-twining tales that are amusing, bizarre and sometimes down right dangerous before we get a sort of alignment at the conclusion. \"Winnfield\" (Samuel L. Jackson) and \"Vincent Vega\" (John Travolta) are a pair of dapper enforcers, despatched to retrieve a stolen briefcase. Though their manner may be precise, the execution of their tasks are usually more hit and miss, definitely messy - and frequently requiring of the specialist clean-up services of \"Mr. Wolf\" (Harvey Keitel). \"Vega\" is also charged by his boss with looking after his cocaine-loving wife \"Mia\" (Uma Thurman) and that flirts with dancing and disaster too. Meantime, ageing boxer \"Butch\" (Bruce Willis) is supposed to help the boss by taking an early dive in a fight. Instead he manages to kill his opponent! Soon he is intent on fleeing town, well at least he tries before he and \"Wallace\" end up being the playthings of some interesting characters who keep their own leather-clad gimp locked in a box... It's really difficult to make sense of the narrative in writing. It flows really well, but at differing speeds and in several different directions at once. The stories are violent but delivered in an almost tongue-in cheek way. The dance between \"Mia\" and \"Vega\" has become the stuff of cinema legend; there is loads of chemistry - especially between Travolta and an on form Jackson who really does deliver his biblical verses with a puritanical - an lethal - zeal; Willis is as good here as he ever was and you cannot but feel sorry for poor old \"Pumpkin\" (Tim Roth) and his pal \"Honey Bunny\" (Amanda Plummer) whose habit of committing petty robberies when they realise that nobody ever thinks to hit a restaurant, all goes awry. The dialogue is cleverly targeted, with wit and pith but also used sparingly when the first rate soundtrack is allowed to let everyone come up for air. Tarantino himself features towards the end as just about everybody gets their just desserts. This is a classy and sharp piece of enigmatic and enjoyable cinema held together well by a creative and visionary director who appreciates how to get the best of a cast that know how to entertain!", "Tarantino is the most overrated director of our times, all his films are silly but people say they are masterpieces, perhaps they are but not for the right way, the only good thing about Tarantino is that he isn't afraid of revenge for the sake of making his characters good.", "really fun to watch and the attention to detail is great", "**One of the unavoidable movies to know Tarantino\u2026 but I think it's not as incredible as it is sometimes said to be.**\r\n\r\nThis was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino's career and made him one of the \"superstar\" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don't think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn't call it regular, a \u201csafe bet\u201d, but we can't deny it, it's original, true to his style and doesn't seem concerned about pleasing anyone.\r\n\r\nThe film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.\r\n\r\nFor many, this film is one of the best of the 90's. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It's reasonably good, it's gained cult status, it has fans, but it's not a masterpiece, not for me. It's not a boring film, it doesn't tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There's a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it's something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn't matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).\r\n\r\nThese are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the \u201cpulp\u201d literary subgenre. I'm not, it's not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn't like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn't\u2026 watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible\u2026 it's the kind of \u201cliterature\u201d that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn't know by heart.\r\n\r\nThe actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn't bad, but he's just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I'm sorry she couldn't go further, but that's life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn't. He's a ham as an actor.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well."], ["A film just in my style. It\u2019s a future/alternate reality kind of apocalyptic action/horror movie. Fairly simple and straightforward plot where the good guys stays pretty much stays as the good guys throughout the move and the hero is really someone that kicks ass throughout the movie. No bloody fussing around with making the hero \u201chuman\u201d or some crap like that.\n\nThe special effects and the apocalyptic sceneries where well done. In general the film was a solid piece of work. The transfer to Blu-ray equally well done. Picture quality was as to be expected and the DTS Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack well balanced with just enough surround effects and LFE to make it very enjoyable.\n\nThe film get a 5.7 rating at IMDB which in my mind is a bit on the low side but then, it\u2019s not really a film for everyone. The so called \u201ccritics\u201d at Rotten Tomatoes gave it 17% which is just pure bullshit but then I have given up on those idiots a long time ago. Most of those \u201ccritics\u201d must come from the American bible belt or something \ud83d\ude26"], [], ["**A very good ending to Kieslowski's trilogy.**\r\n\r\nThis is the last film in Krzysztof Kieslowski's \u201ctrilogy of colors\u201d, and focuses on the unusual friendship between a young and beautiful catwalk model and an elderly retired judge who entertains himself by listening, illegally and without no one knows, the telephone conversations of the neighbors. Why? Out of sheer cynicism. He is a man alone, bitter and unhappy. What follows is a trip in which both characters will go through very similar situations.\r\n\r\nThe film continues to have notable points in terms of cinematography, sets and costumes. As in the previous films, the title color is present in all scenes and is persistently part of the sets and props. Despite being elegant, the music is intense, almost a prop for the scene, and contributes to the overall harmony of the work. As in the previous films, the duo of central actors is responsible for an interpretive tour de force, which is absorbing and impressive: Irene Jacob is an excellent actress, but it turns out to be Jean-Louis Trintignant who stands out the most.\r\n\r\nThe script is quite interesting, for the way it explores the cynicism of the judge's character, and for the way it addresses interpersonal relationships, the honesty and sincerity of love and relationships, the application of the law and the moral and philosophical consequences of judgments. humans. There are some details that are a little unbelievable, like how the judge's character evolves from someone resentful and intractable to a more human person in a short period of time. However, it is a film that is really worth it.", "Aspiring model \"Valentine\" (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob) is driving home one evening when she runs over a dog. Luckily, it's not seriously injured and after a trip to the vet she repatriates it with the \"Judge\" (Jean-Louis Trintignant). A quick look around his home though and she realises that he is a snoop! He listens into all the private conversations of his neighbours, records their chats and their peccadillos - all of which is, of course, illegal. Caught between her disgust at his behaviour and her gradually developing affection for the man (and the dog) she finds herself in a bit of a catch-22 scenario. How will that play out when someone reports him to the gendarmerie and his own court appearance looms? Their's is not the only relationship we see here, and using \"Valentine\" as a conduit, we are exposed to a couple of other people whose issues with loyalty, trust - and fidelity - are there for us to observe and to challenge. Of the three of these entertaining Kieslowski films, I probably preferred \"White\" - but this is a close run thing. This is quickly paced with humour and pith in the writing and featuring a strong and amiable performance from an on-form Jacob. I did not love the conclusion - even if it did serve to pull the threads together with the previous two films, but if you can see all together in one (marathon) go then I think you cannot fail but to be entertained in a thought-provoking fashion by these stand-alone but interconnected themes of humanity and personality."], ["**Pain, tragedy, mourning, mental and psychological anguish, a cathartic journey towards freedom, in a film that is not for all audiences.**\r\n\r\nIt took me three tries to get through this movie in its entirety. As someone who is currently going through a very difficult grieving process, it was particularly hard for me to watch the film.\r\n\r\nIt all starts with a serious car accident where the main character, July, loses her husband and daughter. She, like myself, feels a need to escape, to isolate herself from others, and she almost annuls herself by not bearing the pain and absence of her lost family. As the film is a kind of metaphor around the concept of freedom, to what extent is it liberating to have these attitudes? I sincerely do not know. As much as we run away, our pains don't stop confronting us, we never stop being who we are.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, the film also launches considerations on the hopes and paths of the European Union project through the troubled completion of a symphony, commissioned by the Union and left incomplete upon the death of July's husband, who was its composer.\r\n\r\nI didn't know the director Krzysztof Kieslowski, and I believe that few people will. He is one of the directors who never leaves the festival circuit due to his enormous erudition. I don't believe, in fact, that he made films of a more commercial nature. This film won't please everyone, being relatively indigestible and uncomfortable, cold and depressing like the color that gives it its name. The cinematography is very talented, it is full of artistic resources, frames of great visual value and beauty, cold colors where blue predominates and is omnipresent in almost the entire work.\r\n\r\nWe cannot fail to highlight the excellent interpretive performance given here by Juliette Binoche, in one of the most intense, poignant and strong cinematographic works of her career as an actress. Benoit Regent and Charlotte V\u00e9ry didn't do a bad job either, and each in their own way give a very important support to Binoche's work, but it is the main actress who, due to her enormous merit, sustains the film and really plays.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to stop writing a few lines about the soundtrack of this film: the film is not particularly sound, as the insertion of music is quite punctual, thought out and meticulously articulated with what we are seeing. And instead of using several melodies, or ordering a vast array of incidental pieces, the film uses only one song, which is called \u201cSong for the Unification of Europe\u201d and was composed by Zbigniew Preisner. Made in the period after the Treaty of Maastricht, the film is very \"Europeist\", which is ironic given the prevailing Euroscepticism nowadays, thirty years later.", "Juliette Binoche is on fine form here as \"Julie\". She is driving her composer husband and their daughter along a country road when - next thing they have an encounter with a tree. Now the audience can expect this - we are shown the leaky brake fluid at the start, but we are not necessarily prepared for what is to come as she has to reconcile her own injuries and the difficulties (and opportunities) of her new life. That involves her taking herself deep into the anonymity of Paris - but she is soon to realise that her need for much desired isolation is not reciprocated by her friend who have no intention of letting her disappear under a rock. Things truly come to an head when she re-encounters old flame \"Olivier\" (Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent) and there might just be light at the end of her tunnel? It is quite an observational piece of work, this, and Binoche is well capable of demonstrating just how the trauma and drama of this incident and of her subsequent choices impacts on the character - a reaction that could resonate with many, I suspect. The dialogue is sparing and the pace of this rather potent depiction of grief and it's consequences moves in a measured fashion with no obvious conclusion to draw upon. The supporting cast do exactly that, they provide brief moments for us to recalibrate and adjust as \"Julie\" herself has to adapt, and though I could have been doing with just a little humour to relax the plot at times, it's still a great example of a well considered story and an actor at the top of her game."], ["**I liked it, but the script seems a little too far-fetched.**\r\n\r\nOf the three films in Krzysztof Kieslowski's \u201ccolor trilogy\u201d, this is perhaps the closest to comedy. The plot begins with a couple's divorce: he is Polish and went to France because of her, who is French. Both got married, set up a common life, but the truth is that the couple's sex life is nil, he is not capable of consummating the act. He's not impotent, he's not homosexual, he just seems intimidated by the moment. Not satisfied with that, she keeps the goods, takes everything from her misfortunate ex-husband and threatens him. Living on the street, with no money and no life prospects, he decides to return to Warsaw in his own suitcase. After a while, he is a rich man. He's not an honest man, he didn't make his money in the most innocent way, but the movie ignores the morality around that. It's time to make the little Frenchy pay for what she did to him, and pay dearly.\r\n\r\nLet's go first to the points that I liked the most about this film: on a technical level, it's an impeccable work of art. The director is meticulous, he thinks of the smallest details and wants everything the way he envisioned it. The color white is omnipresent throughout the film, as it was in \u201cBlue\u201d. The cinematography is remarkable, and the construction of the sets and costumes is quite good. Despite being elegant, the music really accentuates the dark comic vein of the film, which works very well. The work of the two main actors, Zbigniew Zamachowski and Julie Delpy, is also very good. He, however, gains more visibility not only for being the protagonist, but for the very ironic and pleasantly funny way in which the character was developed. Delpy's role is not as rich, nor as interesting, but the actress manages herself well.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem I had with this film is the near-absolute unlikelihood of the script. In addition to the protagonist making money very easily without apparently any problems or harmful consequences, he is very much torn between love and revenge. On the one hand, it's obvious that he's never forgotten his ex-wife, that he loves her, despite all the bad things she's done and all the difficult situations he's been through to him because of her actions. He just doesn't seem to be able to hate her. On the other hand, he hates her enough to make her pay for everything, and in a very original way. What are we left with? Revenge without hate?", "This is my favourite of the Kieslowski trilogy - even if it might make you wonder about the efficiency of airport security in future! It all centres around \"Karol Karol\" (Zbigniew Zamachowski) who is facing divorce from his glamorous wife (Julie Delpy) - on the grounds of non-consummation - and that is going to reduce him to poverty. Luckily, on the Metro platform, he encounters \"Mikolaj\" (Janusz Gajos) and the two concoct a plan to smuggle him back to his native Poland where he can make his fortune (maybe) and get some revenge on his wife. His journey doesn't quite go to plan, but he eventually manages to get a job working security and when he overhears the plans of his bosses to buy up some land, he jumps the gun and is soon on the road to riches.... It's funny, this film. Not in a ha-ha sort of fashion, but the writing and the characterisations create an enjoyable series of scenarios - some, admittedly, less plausible than others - as the adaptable and quick-thinking \"Karol\" carefully plots his vengeance. The supporting cast deliver well - his hairdressing cousin \"Jurek\" frequently stealing his scenes but not in a way we might expect. Short and sweet and well worth a watch."], ["I've seen this movie a couple of times over the years and while it's entertaining enough, there was always something holding it back. It's got some creativity, a decent cast with Kurt Russell and James Spader and the premise of a portal to another part of the universe is interesting (and more than enough to spawn a couple DTV movies and a couple TV series), but can't really put my finger on why. **3.25/5**", "Like so many other movies this one has been politicized in some of the more negative reviews because...well, I really can't say,I honestly have no clue what Stargate has to do with international politics...at all.\r\n\r\nOstensibly it's because it is the American Military meets folks still living like its Ancient Egypt and kill their god that critics are objecting to on IMDb...\r\n\r\n...Forgetting, of course, that their god enslaved them all.\r\n\r\nI am further to the left than most people I've met and...I just don't buy that this has ANYTHING to do with politics.\r\n\r\nI think this flick was pitched as \"Indiana Jones meets Star Wars\" and I am 100% certain that it was made to be Indiana Jones Meets Star Wars.\r\n\r\nAnd of course they can't name it that so they called it \"Stargate\" And I am going to review it like it was meant to be reviewed.\r\n\r\nThis film is Indiana Jones meets Star Wars. It was made to be a hit, in fact, it should have been a far bigger hit than it turned out to be.\r\n\r\nI mean, just the concept makes me want to watch it all over again...It's the same concept as \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" except they remembered that Indiana Jones has no place in the world of Aliens.\r\n\r\nIn fact I would have even loved the TV show if, you know, all the Alien worlds they visited didn't look a lot like Canada.\r\n\r\nAll you have here is a really fun action adventure sci-fi movie that doesn't try to make any statements.

This film is worth its salt simply by the virtue of being unique.

It's definitely the weakest entry of the series, yet I still found it entertaining enough.\r\n\r\nMartin Short (Jack Frost) is the star of this second sequel to 1994's <em>'The Santa Clause'</em>, outshining lead Tim Allen; who is still decent, by the way.

It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.\r\n\r\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\r\n\r\nIt's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\r\n\r\nThose in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\r\n\r\nIf you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10", "Make way for the best film ever made people. **Make way.**", "There is a reason why this movie is at the top of any popular list your will find.\r\nVery strong performances from lead actors and a story line from the literary brilliance of Stephen King (and no, its not a horror).\r\nSufficient drama and depth to keep you interested and occupied without stupefying your brain.

The film is set over a period of over ten years, and depicts some of the most brutal aspects of prison life; but also some it's more hopeful.

Meanwhile the two sisters were great characters: they were emotional when the situation called for it, but gave an even and restrained performance. I would have like to have seen more of them.", "**A rather conventional and average family drama, where DiCaprio and Depp's performances turn out to be the only truly worthy note.**\r\n\r\nSometimes, what makes a film remarkable is the extraordinary performance of an actor, and that becomes even more admirable when that actor is extremely young. That's what we have in this film, a conventional family drama, where a young adult tries to live his life as normally as possible while having to take care of everyone around him, particularly his mother, who is morbidly obese and depressed, and his younger brother, who has a mental problem that the movie never really specifies.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I didn't find the script particularly interesting. Cinema is full of family dramas, and this one has nothing really new or fresh to add. And if the script doesn't seem remarkable to me, the production values \u200b\u200band technical aspects deserve even less attention, with the film betting on very conventional and average visuals, and a pace that sometimes slows down and falters, the result of an editing not always well executed.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the film more interesting is the cast, which includes two young actors, then very promising, called Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio. Depp is older than DiCaprio, and his career was relatively established when he agreed to star in this film. DiCaprio, on the other hand, was still an unknown young man and was beginning to emerge. However, the collaboration between them, in this film, is remarkable, and it seems that both knew how to get the best out of each other, to our benefit.\r\n\r\nAlthough today we know Depp through a wide range of peculiar characters, what he did in this film is the complete opposite, and his character is one hundred percent ordinary, responsible, mature and strong. DiCaprio, however, stands out the most, even more than Depp. Playing a mentally disturbed teenager, DiCaprio had a lot of leeway to study and design the character and his mannerisms and tics. The result is truly credible and surprising.\r\n\r\nMary Steenburgen and Darlene Cates provide very effective support and give us the best female performances.

Maybe 18 when they made it?\r\n\r\nI doubt they would give an Oscar to a kid that young, but see that he's CLEARLY not Intellectually Disabled and how believable he was, well, that's probably one of the best performances I've seen. That was Oscar worthy.\r\n\r\nBesides that, it was really a Johnny Depp vehicle... as much as a 90s indy film can be, and he played a calm, low key, and utterly charming role in a film about a man that had to maybe grow up too fast and deal with too much at too young an age.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, a charming little love story.

He has a job in the struggling local grocery store that sees him deliver to the \"Carver\" family. \"Betty\" (Mary Steenburgen) is the bored housewife there with whom \"Gilbert\" has some fun whilst her husband is off selling insurance. It's all a relentless cycle that's going nowhere until \"Becky\" (Juliette Lewis) comes to town and starts to give \"Gilbert\" a sense of a different purpose. She begins to help him see that he must live a bit of his own life too. When a fairly predictable tragedy ensues, everyone has to make some choices - and they're not easy. DiCaprio is pretty outstanding as the soon-to-be eighteen year old lad whose behaviour would test the patience of a saint. His loud and repetitive language and his child-like tantrums are just the tip of the iceberg and his performance - especially his grinning - gives \"Arnie\" an engaging amount of character. He's not going for the sympathy vote, either - his portrayal elicits feelings of affection, sure, but also of cheerfully wanting to strangle him! Depp holds this all together with assurance and there's plenty of humour to keep the melodrama at bay. It starts off strongly and continues for two hours of characterful and thought-provoking drama that can at times come across as just a little contrived, but it is still a good watch."], ["Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis feels like a classic watch, like a movie that started a trope...but I can't think of a single other movie that did what this movie does.  Sure there are movies about comas, amnesia, lying, but they don't do it in the same way, and I honestly believe it's because this movie did it so well that no one wants to risk copying it and do worse.\r\n\r\nThis is also a great example of good situational comedy without bleeding over into abuse humor: at no point is she \"suffering\", she's not attacked, or wronged, but she's in a difficult situation that doesn't lend towards pleasantness in a ridiculous fashion, mostly because the family is insane, in the best of ways.\r\n\r\nEvery single actor in this really brings it too.  There are plenty of notable names, but as much as Sandra Bullock elevates the quiet, reserved character of Lucy, there are so many other good actors and characters throughout the movie, it feels extremely balanced, despite all the different story angles happening.\r\n\r\nThe other thing happening is that this is sort of a reverse mystery.  Instead of information that other characters know being hidden from the audience to be revealed later, the audience is almost the only one to know the truth until aspects are slowly revealed to the rest of the cast.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't see this yet, put it on your list, I promise it still holds up: even if there are no smart phones yet, you'll barely notice.", "Insanely cheesy and overtly sentimental... yet, I kinda like 'While You Were Sleeping'.\r\n\r\nSandra Bullock is probably the main reason for the latter, as she gives a near perfect performance for this sorta role. The rest of the cast are good too, from Bill Pullman to Peter Gallagher to Jason Bernard. The story is paced finely, it's really just the strong cheese that brings the rating down for me. Still: 7/10.\r\n\r\nIt's the sixth Jon Turteltaub film that I've seen: I'd class each one as good. Reliable director!", "**While You Were Sleeping is about more than just romance. It\u2019s about finding family and, in this case, an adorable but crazy and entertaining family.**\r\n\r\nWhile You Were Sleeping is a heartwarming romantic comedy with the lead falling in love with a quirky but sincere family as much as their charming son. The script isn\u2019t perfect, with a couple of cliche and stereotypical rom-com moments, but the cast of goofy but not completely outrageous characters keep you engaged and want to see more of their antics. Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman are a fun couple to watch and laugh with, and the whole premise of the film presents plenty of fun moments of awkwardness to laugh at. While You Were Sleeping is a funny, heartfelt, and wholesome rom-com from the 90s that my parents watched 100 times while I was growing up, which was way too much, but I have to admit\u2026 it\u2019s a good one.", "**A good and really funny romantic comedy.**\r\n\r\nI don't consider myself a fan of romantic comedies, so I feel free to talk about them with complete dismay. And what I want to say about this romantic comedy is that it manages to be much better than we might expect at first glance.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this film manages to associate an excellent lead actress with a good story, full of comic moments. It all starts with a platonic passion that a young woman feels when she sees a man going to work every day. One day, she ends up saving his life, and a succession of misconceptions ends up making his family believe that she was going to marry him without them knowing. The comedy, of a familiar and friendly nature, has a Christmas background and is extremely appealing to watch in the company of the whole family.\r\n\r\nSandra Bullock, however, is what makes the film work. I can't see an actress with more talent to be naive and nice at the same time as being funny. She has the time, space and material to shine, and she never misses an opportunity to dazzle us with her extraordinary creativity and skill. Bill Pullman also does a very nice job, and there are other actors (Peter Boyle, Jack Warden) who add even more talent to the film.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film is much simpler. Cinematography, sets, costumes and effects are quite regular, there is no real investment in these aspects, just an effort is made to keep the film within industry standards. However, this is not a real problem if we allow ourselves to be seduced by the story told and the moments of comedy that the film gives us.", "Sandra Bullock does almost all of the heaving lifting in this engaging, if slightly far-fetched love story. She works in the token booth at her local Chicago train station where every morning she sees that cashmere-coated \"Peter\" (Peter Gallagher). She's got a bit of a crush on him, but after he gets accosted by some muggers on the platform and knocked onto the track she is more concerned that he will end up getting crushed by the 7.45 express! She manages to drag him to safety and next thing we are in the hospital, he has amnesia and she has allowed a scenario to develop where everyone things she's his fianc\u00e9e. It's only really his brother \"Jack\" (Bill Pullman) who's a tad sceptical about this woman about whom none of his family have heard and as the two start to spar, they also start to... The rest of this follows some quite predicable lines but there's a fun chemistry between the always expressive Bullock and Pullman with Jack Warden and the scene stealing Glynis Johns adding some character to the family dynamic. Though it's hardly laugh-out-loud, we do get a sort of feel-good feeling that warms your cockles as it trundles along amiably."], ["One of the funniest movies of all time. Still to this day, every time I watch it, I can't help but laugh. One of my favorite movies of all time.", "**Jim Carrey is the movie.**\r\n\r\nJim Carrey is one of the great comic actors of the 90's, and this film is one of those that opened the doors of stardom for him. He already worked with comedy before, of course, as an actor and stand-up artist, and he took advantage of this background to build Ace, an animal detective with eccentric habits and manners.\r\n\r\nIn general, this type of comedy is not to my liking, but I have to recognize Carrey's enormous qualities and talent. In cooperation with director Tom Shadyac (I don't know if it was the first, but there were several throughout their career), the actor did a truly inspired job that gives the film all its strength and originality. Imagining this movie without Carrey is impossible. Sure, there's a lot of exaggeration, and the rest of the cast is driven to exaggerate, trying to keep up with the protagonist's bizarreness, but that's a minor problem, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe film also has good cinematography, which makes good use of the scenarios and chosen filming locations. The pace of the film is quite fast and the feeling that remains is that the film could have gone on longer and a lot of things would have been cut on the editor's table. For me, the great weakness of this film turns out to be the script, involving the sudden disappearance of the mascot of a baseball club \u2013 a dolphin. The strength of the protagonist actor and the originality of his character end up transforming the whole story into a detail without much force, a mere pretext for Carrey to do all that."], ["The Crow (1994) \r\n\r\nI hadn't seen it for about ten years and as the full moon came beaming through my apartment window late last night, it just felt right to indulge in some Proyas Gothic excellence. \r\n\r\nThe question still taps away at all our doors, namely would the film be the cult classic it became without the Brandon Lee tragedy? That's a tricky one to answer because we all deep down have a morbid curiosity about us, especially with films and their stars. This is why I got a lot more from re-watching the movie after a very long period of time, namely that it may have drew many of us in years ago because of the tragedy and heart aching back story to writer James O'Barr's birthing of Eric Draven the character, but it can now enthral, thrill and shatter emotions of its own accord. \r\n\r\nThe Gothic art design and the soundtrack are emo personified before such a label was invented, Lee is lithe and skilful and serving notice to what a talent we were robbed of that fateful day in March 1993. The villains are a roll call of go to guys for such roles, Kelly, Wincott, Todd, while Ernie Hudson fronts up as good cop personified. And finally Proyas, struggling with the budget even before Brandon's death, that he manages to create this world of perpetual bleakness, but still offer hope and beauty - the latter via tracking shots, pull aways and intricate frame shots of a tormented Draven, shows him to be a purveyor of considerable skills. \r\n\r\nAll told, The Crow (1994) deserves to not be thought of as a cult classic, but just as a classic, period. 9.5/10 ", "**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2011.**\r\n\r\nIn the vein of films like _The Punisher_ and _Mad Max_, _The Crow_ first hit my screen only four years ago, way back when my DVD collection consisted of only about 40 films, (now it is around 500). I had $10 to my name but I was intent on expanding the thing, a girl I'd met only that day, suggested I buy it from Sanity, when there used to be one in Civic. Since that day, when I was well and truly blown away by it, we've always intended to make our tradition of \"Crow and Coffee\" (wherein you watch _The Crow_ and drink several litres of Ice Coffee & Bailey's) a repeated thing.\r\n\r\nI feel as if this one should have been known to me for far longer than it has. It's quite a point of shame in the Goth community to have none been raised on the shit. And I can tell why. The film blends some of the most incredible bands out (The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Violent Femmes, Pantera), is filled with great actors, it's based on one of the best comics I've ever had the good fortune of reading, and it's overshadowed by the death of the actor playing lead protagonist Eric Draven, Brandon Lee, son of martial arts master Bruce Lee.\r\n\r\n_The Crow_ is filled with the dark and ominous. Towards the end, Draven fights using a martial arts move that was performed in honour of Brandon Lee's father, Bruce Lee, when he used an identical style in _Enter the Dragon_, the last film his father ever starred in, before his untimely death. In another scene, Draven can be seen filling a gun-barrel up with metal, and shooting them out into a pawn shop, Brandon Lee was killed on set during filming, when a metal casing became lodged in a gun that was then expelled by a blank, fatally wounding Lee in the torso. Behind the scenes, on the first day of shooting a carpenter suffered sever burns on set after his crane hit power lines. Later, a grip truck caught fire, an angry sculpting employee crashed his car through the set's plaster shop and another member of the crew accidentally impaled his own hand with a screwdriver. According to the biography of Bruce Lee, Brandon's death was predicted by his father after awakening from a coma, he foresaw Brandon's death long before he had even considered taking up acting, supposedly.\r\n\r\nBy no accounts is _The Crow_ unpredictable, it's rather the opposite, but it makes up for this in so many ways! It notches up some of the best quotes in film history, as well as being badass, and yet so utterly convincingly emotional. There is essentially no demographic I can think of that wouldn't enjoy (at least a little) this dark film's gothic atmosphere, gritty hopelessness, world-changing special effects, riveting action, and well-deserved cult status.\r\n\r\n91%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_", "Well if you though it was wet on \"Blade Runner\" (1982) then welcome to a ruined city where the torrential rain never seems to stop. A series of flashbacks tells us that two graves hold the bodies of a young couple about to be married. That's before local kingpin \"Top Dollar\" (Michael Wincott), who had designs on their building, sent his henchmen to \"coax\" them out. A year after this tragedy a crow alights on the grave of \"Eric\" (Brandon Lee) and enlivens his corpse so that he may avenge the brutality visited on his fianc\u00e9e and himself. What now ensues is a dark and menacing revenge thriller that, though fairly predictable, sees this former rock musician develop some astonishingly lethal ninja skills as he identifies and then rather entertainingly despatches a variety of drug dealing undesirables whilst retaining a sense of the decent by befriending local cop \"Albrecht\" (Ernie Hudson) and re-connecting with the young \"Sarah\" (Rochelle Davis) whose mother is another of the addicts in this dismal and hopeless city. It's the enigmatic \"Myca\" (Bai Ling) who spots the Achilles heel of our hero and so sets a scene with her menacing beau as \"Eric\" hones in on the final stage of a challenge that will hopefully allow him to return to his own grave in peace. Lee is really is in his element here and Alex Proyas and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski use the grim, sodden and ruined environment to depict as physical a corruption as the story does a societal one. What dialogue there is is largely left to an engaging contribution from Hudson, who has his own mini axe to grind with his police colleagues who saw him busted from detective for trying to investigate the activities of \"Dollar\" before. When you watch this film, you can't help but think on the number of other characterisations it has spawned, and it shows how revenge horror can work without resorting to endless special effects and jump-scenes. A cinema screening is best - a big dark room that makes you hear that relentless rain fall all around you.", "This is my first viewing of The Crow and it is a great, dark comic book adaptation that at times reminded me of Batman and moments that seemed to later inspire The Dark Knight, in particular with The Joker. It's a shame about Brandon Lee as he is amazing in the lead and this could've led to a great career. There are some poignant scenes and a genuine heart at its core. Just a home run from Alex Poyas. **4.25/5**"], ["Best movie ever.", "This is the best movie ever!"], ["Good, if a little light on actual laughs.\r\n\r\nHugh Grant is the best thing about <em>'Four Weddings and a Funeral'</em>, he gives an amusing performance. The plot is obvious and speaks for itself, it does lead to a few interesting shenanigans. Some of the dialogue is iffy, as is some of the editing though.\r\n\r\nNone of the cast behind Grant stood out to me, with the exception of Rowan Atkinson; but that's only down to how well known he is in general, as here he is underused. I found Andie MacDowell's performance very wooden. I appreciate them not going the obvious route with Kristin Scott Thomas' character, even if it makes her Fiona redundant throughout.\r\n\r\nJust about serviceable, worth watching if only once.", "Whilst this largely centres around the persona of \"Charles\" (Hugh Grant) it's really more the compendium of characters that makes this comedy work well. He is late for the first of the weddings, but that doesn't really matter except it's where he first espies \"Carrie\" (Andi MacDowell). A one night stand ensues and both seem to like the other, but nothing comes of it and we proceed to the next wedding, then the next. It's this third one that turns out to be her's - to a laird a little older than she. \"Charles\" is crestfallen but what to do? Might it be best to settle for someone else - even is she's not the one? Richard Curtis has written a gem of a comedy here, allowing a slew of characterful personalities to slot into the life of \"Charles\". The underused, brightly waist-coated, Simon Callow is probably my favourite. He and boyfriend \"Matthew\" (John Hannah) have an habit of exposing the more preposterous and yukkie sides of the wedding; the twee folk singers and the guests who overdo the free bar or think they are god's gift. Indeed, as much of this takes a swing at the whole symbolism and ceremony of marriage as it plays on the foibles and flaws of \"Charles\" and his friends. Rowan Atkinson's bumbling vicar \"Gerald\" has the pews in hysterics and Charlotte Coleman is great as the maybe a bit too frank \"Scarlett\". It pieces together a bit to serendipitously and I maybe don't need to hear the Wet Wet Wet song again any time soon, but it showcases a range British acting talent in an amiable and enjoyable fashion for two hours."], ["If you enjoy reading my reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is (obviously) a SPOILER review. I mean, who hasn\u2019t seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you\u2019re one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I\u2019m just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don\u2019t really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven\u2019t notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!\r\n\r\nI rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That\u2019s how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can\u2019t simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia\u2019s tears. Mufasa\u2019s tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole \u201cremember who you are\u201d speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer\u2018s score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It\u2019s one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an \u201cokay\u201d scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a \u201cgood\u201d movie turn into a \u201cgreat\u201d one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn\u2019t that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.\r\n\r\nDuring the stampede sequence, the score doesn\u2019t lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It\u2019s that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it\u2019s solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba\u2019s roar \u2026 Damn it, I\u2019m crying again!\r\n\r\nThe animation is some of Disney\u2019s best. It\u2019s not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone\u2019s childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There\u2019s no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they\u2019re feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone\u2019s wallpaper even today.\r\n\r\nThe songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, \u2026 Every single song is someone\u2019s favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career\u2019s biggest role, Darth Vader isn\u2019t the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character\u2019s voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who\u2019s the \u201cbad guy\u201d, and that\u2019s unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It\u2019s true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba\u2019s journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it\u2019s a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can\u2019t just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a masterpiece! It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an animated film. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was \u201cmade for kids\u201d. People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it\u2019s undeniably one of Disney\u2019s best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs \u2026 The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its \u201clive-action\u201d remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.\r\n\r\nRating: A+", "Certainly not one of Disney's better animations from a technical perspective - the artwork lacks the vibrancy and detail of many of their earlier stories; but the combined efforts of Sir Tim Rice, Elton John and Hans Zimmer make this an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It is told in two parts - the first sees a son \"Simba\" born to the king \"Mufasa\"; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend \"Nala\" is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king's major-domo \"Zazu\". One fan the new cub really doesn't have, however, is the king's rather unimpressed brother \"Scar\" who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - \"Nala\" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling. It is an enjoyable film to watch but I wasn't captivated by it."], ["Fun fantasy-comedy that utilizes Jim Carrey's physicality, and comedic timing, to the extreme and while some of the jokes didn't land and the mask himself (both Stanley and Dorian) was a bit ridiculous, even within the confines of this universe, still found it to be entertaining enough, plus it is Cameron Diaz's feature debut... **3.5/5**", "Not as good as I remember, still an amusing watch regardless.\r\n\r\nIt's been many, many years since I last watched <em>'The Mask'</em>, hence why I hadn't had it logged on here before now, and while it isn't as funny or as quotable as I thought it would be (I remember really liking it as a kid), there is still enough in there that I got much entertainment from.\r\n\r\nJim Carrey's performance is superb, without him you'd have a very cringe and ultimately disappointing flick. Interesting to note that he did this, <em>'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'</em> and <em>'Dumb and Dumber'</em> (which I gotta see at some point!) all in 1994 - quite the year! Peter Greene and Peter Riegert are also involved, though it's very much the debuting Cameron Diaz that is the best of the rest behind Carrey.\r\n\r\nApparently this had a sequel released in 2005, <em>'Son of the Mask'</em>.

It's not particularly clever in narrative or themes, but with its blending of action, romance and comedy seamlessly coming together as a whole, Maverick is practically hard to dislike. Even the cast seem to be having a real good time, with Gibson smooth and roguish, Foster dainty yet spunky and Garner (the original Maverick from the TV show) offering up a sort of stoic maturity over proceedings; with all three playing the comedy with ease (how great it is to see Foster in such a role). Donner and Goldman have also shown respect to both the TV show and the Western in general (check out those lovely landscapes), while it's always fun to play spot the numerous stars in the cameos. \r\n\r\nHarmless fluff, then, but always watchable and never once over reaching itself by trying to be something it's not. 7.5/10"], ["_**Awesome 60's go-go women, music and thrills, but childish script and melodramatics**_\r\n\r\nReleased in 1965 and conceived & directed by Russ Meyer, \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" is a campy melodrama/crime thriller starring Tura Satana as a sneering vixen who, along with her two go-go dancing pals (Haji & Lori Williams), entertain themselves in their spare time by hot rodding in the desert. After a mishap wherein the trio apprehend a winsome bikini girl (Susan Bernard) they smell easy money at a remote ranch in the desert, inhabited by a rich old man (Stuart Lancaster) and his two sons (Dennis Busch & Paul Trinka). Ray Barlow plays a \"nice boy\" desert racer while Michael Finn is on hand as a gabby gas station attendant.\r\n\r\nThe movie has a big reputation as a cult flick and Meyer's definitive film, along with 1970's \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,\" so I was very interested in finally viewing it. The first 20 minutes or so are fun and entertaining in a swingin' 60s kind of way, highlighted by the voluptuous female cast in which Meyer takes full advantage in illustrating their beauty (no nudity). The music, cars, apparel and thrills are additional highpoints.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, once the women happen upon the ranch with the mad \"Ben Cartwright\" and \"Hoss\" & \"Adam\" (sorry, no \"Little Joe\") the lousy writing and corresponding eye-rolling histrionics manifest. It's as if Meyer and fellow writer Jackie Moran were attempting to make a mid-60s desert version of one of Tennessee Williams melodramas, but didn't have the writing expertise or professional cast to pull it off. As such, the story loses the viewer's interest and you're left to laughing at the exaggerated antics and trying to enjoy the attractions noted above. Being shot in B&W doesn't help matters.\r\n\r\nFor a better movie that treads similar terrain (albeit with a wholly different plot) I suggest the contemporaneous \"Village of the Giants,\" which was released a mere 2\u00bd months after \"Faster\" and is in glorious color. The women are just as good, if not better, and the music is superior, not to mention it lacks an utterly scornful one-dimensional she-devil (don't get me wrong, Tura's great, but her character is so one-note disdainful it gets old after 25 minutes and you just want someone, ANYONE, male or female, to knock her silly). \"Village\" also doesn't pretentiously try to be a serious 60's tragedy \u00e0 la \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in the desert.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 83 minutes and was shot in the Mojave Desert (Lake Isabella, Lake Cunniback, Johannesburg, Randsburg & Ollie Pesch's Musical Wells Ranch) and Van Nuys (The Pussycat Club), California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+"], [], [], ["When paradise turns into nightmare\r\n\t\r\nRELEASED IN 1993 and directed by Sydney Pollack based on John Grisham\u2019s novel, \"The Firm\u201d is a crime drama/thriller starring Tom Cruise as a top Harvard grad lawyer who desperately wants to leave behind his working-class origins and takes a high-paying job at a firm in Memphis. He and his wife (Jeanne Tripplehorn) are ecstatic in their affluent new world until clues mount up that the firm has a sinister side. Gene Hackman plays his mentor at the firm while Ed Harris appears as an FBI agent. Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn and Gary Busey are also on hand.\r\n\r\nThis has long been one of my favorites from this genre. You really feel for McDeere (Cruise) & his wife as their utopia morphs into an inescapable hell. In the Washington DC scene you grasp how limited their choices are as they\u2019re caught in a crossfire between the Mob and the FBI. McDeere must use his wits, his knowledge and \u201cgolden connections\u201d for them to get out unscathed, if possible. \r\n\r\nI always favored the piano score by Dave Grusin, which some have described as \u201cbouncy.\u201d While you could call it that, it has different tones depending on the sequence. For instance, during the closing city chase it\u2019s driving and portentous. There\u2019s also a melancholic component when suitable. The positive side of the piano score is that it makes the film timeless. Consider quality movies from that general era which were horribly dated by conventional scores, like \u201cNo Way Out\u201d (1987).        \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in Memphis, Tennessee; West Memphis, Arkansas; Cayman Islands; Washington DC; Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A/A-", "**An excellent film, full of tension and suspense.**\r\n\r\nIn my country there is a popular adage that probably also has an equivalent in other countries and that says \u201cthere is no beauty without a flaw\u201d, that is, if something is too good, it must be wrong. And despite the excellent education and academic evaluations, the lawyer of this film seems not to know this simple truth.\r\n\r\nBased on a novel by John Grisham, the script follows Mitch, a young lawyer who has just been hired by a large and important law firm in Memphis, Tennessee. The job is irresistible: a high salary, several perks, a car and paid trips, everything a young yuppie and his wife could want. What he doesn't know is that his new bosses are heavily financed by mafia groups to whom they provide protection and legal advice, and that lawyers who seek to leave the firm end up mysteriously dying. When he finds out, he will have to decide what to do: either maintain his loyalty to the firm or collaborate with the FBI and frame his colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe film has an excellent suspense that works wonderfully, and keeps us hooked until the end. The direction, in charge of the excellent Sydney Pollak, is really good and there is a certain similarity between this film and \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d, another intense suspense film in which Cruise and Pollak work together again. And I have no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork also had its influence on the way Pollak conceived his film. The script has many twists and turns and may demand some attention from the audience, but I guarantee that this will not be a problem if the spectator allows himself to be involved and absorbed by the suspense and tension that are gradually imposed.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of Cruise, but I recognize that he is a solid and sympathetic protagonist, making the character someone for whom we can have a certain empathy, oscillating between naivety and wit. There are a good handful of well done action scenes that the actor was more than cut out for. Gene Hackman, in turn, gives life to a mature, bohemian lawyer who seems to be more interested in traveling and swimming in the Caribbean than in working with his clients. However, he was also a sympathetic presence, and I really hoped that his character would get away with it somehow. Jeanne Tripplehorn doesn't seem to have much to do, and I thought, at first, that she would just be the protagonist's shy and fragile wife. However, the script gives us a twist that refocuses the character and gives her a much more active and intervening role than we could guess in the first half-hour length. One can also mention the good performances of Ed Harris, Steven Hill and Wilford Brimley, in roles that are tougher and closer to an action movie. Holly Hunter also appears here, but in such a minimal character that it seems inconceivable to me that she was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has many qualities that we can point out: the cinematography is good and gives us an elegant look and good colors, so that the film does not look as old and dull as other films of the same year. The settings are excellent, in particular the offices and the paradise hotel in the Cayman Islands, where some beautiful and very colorful underwater scenes were filmed. The film passes through Memphis, Washington and other places, always with a careful eye on the choice of filming locations and the best framing. We don't have a show of visual and special effects, but the little that is done works very well. What definitely deserves a mention is the excellent soundtrack, based massively on the piano, and which is really effective in the task of accentuating the environment, deepening the suspense and gradually making things more exciting."], ["**Despite being predictable and loaded with clich\u00e9s, it is a film that marked a generation, alerted many consciences to very serious issues, and is still very beautiful thirty years later.**\r\n\r\nThis is certainly one of the films that made an impression on people during the 90's, and that maintained its popularity and sympathy for many years. Today I think it has been forgotten, and in part I feel sorry for it. However, I believe that the film has already done its job: not only did it entertain those who saw it and continue to see it, but it also had a certain social role in the way it awakened in younger people (but not only them) a certain awareness of ecology, for the preservation of endangered animals and species. I also believe that the film had a certain responsibility for changing the thinking of zoos and places that keep animals in captivity: instead of being \u201canimal deposits\u201d for public entertainment, they became institutions with ever greater relevance in the preservation of animals: today, they are essential for the survival of species whose natural habitats have been destroyed and which are only perpetuated in captivity. They also take the lead in the assisted reproduction of many animals, such as the Giant Panda Bear, for example, as well as in the rescue, veterinary treatment and preparation of animals that, having been illegally hunted or lived many years in human company, need to return to wildness.\r\n\r\nThus, this film turns out to be more relevant for the effect it had on people than by itself. Analyzing it in a simple way, it is a rather sugary film, loaded with clich\u00e9s and without great artistic quality. A family entertainment film, excellent to watch with the kids and which, for years, was almost institutional on television during the Christmas season. The script is quite simple, and takes a rebellious and angry teenager to regenerate when he begins to have contact with an orca that has lived in captivity for years. The friendship between them is touching and sincere, as well as the boy's efforts, and the friends he makes, to release her to the seas, in a race against time and against the action of the villains, the owners of the park where she is kept, and who don't care about her at all. It is an extremely predictable film, which excessively romanticizes the release of animals kept in captivity, making the public forget that a whole previous preparation is necessary, taking several years, and that we never know if the animal, after years depending on humans, is it really going to adapt. Keiko, the orca that the movie used (and who lived in captivity for years after the movie), would eventually be prepared and released to the sea, but as we know, she never adapted to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe film has a good cast, but a terrible conception of characters. None of the characters are really good and all are clich\u00e9s: the heroic teenager, the Native American full of ancestral wisdom who knows animals like no one else, the arrogant capitalists with no respect for anything or anyone... Excluding the orca Keiko, it's Jason James Ritcher who will stand out as an actor, in the role of the teenager who saves the day. He does what it takes, and I think he was relatively credible in his effort. Michael Madsen also deserves praise for his work, in a film that, incidentally, will be one of the most popular of his artistic career. Lori Petty and Jayne Atkinson are pretty good, August Schellenberg does what he can with the clich\u00e9 given to him. The rest simply doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film stands out for its good cinematography. A lot of '90s movies seem ancient when we see them now, but this is one of those laudable exceptions that deserves to be mentioned. The filming locations, as well as the sets, also deserve a positive note for their visual beauty. The sound effects are very good, and the visual and special effects deserve praise, in particular the animatronic whale, which is quite realistic. Finally, a note to praise the quality of the main theme of the soundtrack created for this film, which is one of the most beautiful of its time.", "I guess Free Willy depends on how old you were in 1993.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, I really like Family Friendly, if they are done right they can be entertaining and uplifting. And, the kid in me can still see how people would love it, and still love it, if they saw it as a little kid.\r\n\r\nBut I was 13 when Free Willy came out, and, honestly, it's not E.T., it's not The Goonies, it's not even Radio Flyer let alone Sandlot.\r\n\r\nIt's a little too trite, a little too earnest, a little too childish and it lacks the fun and sense of adventure that films like Flight of the Navigator and The Explorers still hold.\r\n\r\nIn other words, for a family friendly movie, it's more kid friendly and not family enough, and it doesn't age well. I think if you are older than 10 when you see it, you're likely to throw the 1 star out there because it honestly doesn't have that much to offer to people much older. And, if you are under 10 when you saw it, year, it's probably a nostalgia classic to you.\r\n\r\nIt's just one of the family friendly movies that forgot it's supposed to be fun for the whole family, and that makes it age dependent."], ["***Top-of-the-line crime thriller with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones***\r\n\r\nReleased in 1993 and based on the TV show from 30 years earlier, \u201cThe Fugitive\u201d stars Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble, an innocent fugitive framed for murder. As he pursues the one-armed killer & those who pulled his strings, a determined U.S. Marshal (Tommy Lee Jones) hunts Kimble down from wilderness regions to the streets of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe first 40 minutes contain the most action, hooking the viewer with an exhilarating bus wreck/train wreck followed by a phenomenal dam sequence. The rest of the movie is an intelligent and suspenseful cat-and-mouse chase with Kimble zeroing-in on those who framed him and why.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Fugitive\u201d was a deserved box office hit, costing $40 million and raking in $369 million with $184 of that domestically. To realize just how well-done it is, check out the sequel, \u201cU.S. Marshals\u201d (1998), which features the same basic plot, but without most of the magic.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes and was shot in Illinois and North Carolina; the dam sequence, for instance, was filmed at Cheoah Dam, Tapoco, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"], [], [], ["If you somehow missed this movie and have never seen it then watch it immediately. As a young boy of 9 on my way to the cinema I wasn't at all prepared for the on-screen awesomeness I was about to witness, one of the defining movies of my childhood and of the modern age. With special effects that simply blew any and all previous dino movies out of the water, compelling story and the odd comic moment such as the Mr Arnolds arm it really did make that evening something I will remember forever. So successful it went on to spawn 3 sequels, the second was enjoyable, the third not so much. The newest Chris Pratt one, I'll leave that for you but its worth a watch, especially if you want to wash the taste of the 3rd one out of your mouth.

A personal favourite._", "\"Life finds a way\u2026 to let us enjoy dinos in theaters\"\r\n\r\nFilthy rich millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is about to open a dinosaur theme park. He invites a couple of experts to satisfy his investors. During a preview tour things go awfully wrong.\r\n\r\nWhile \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 is too simplistic to be a perfect movie it is blockbuster cinema at its very best. Spielberg grabs you by the throat from the get go and you instantly know you\u2019re in for quite a ride.\r\nThe story is simple but effective. Author Michael Crichton did his very best to make the cloning dinosaurs part plausible. When you have living giant meat-eaters in your amusement park it\u2019s not hard to come up with something which causes things to go south so fast before you can say T-rex.\r\n\r\nThe movie works because it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. The characters are somewhat underdeveloped but their main purpose is to serve as dino treats. The Ian Malcolm character (Jeff Goldblum) is of little use but he\u2019s funny. Grumpy Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) is the perfect counterpart. You can\u2019t help but root for these characters.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the movie stand out are the ground-breaking special effects. Even to this day it\u2019s remarkable what ILM and Stan Winston\u2019s crew achieved. Although a 'Jaws' approach would have perhaps worked better (Love the shot of the T-rex\u2019 leg in the mud) the dinos look so realistic.\r\n\r\nWhat \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 does have in common with 'Jaws' is John Williams\u2019 score. Although not as ominous and iconic as 'Jaws', Williams went for wonderment this time around. Perhaps not regarded as his most famous work it\u2019s amazing. When the experts travel to the island Williams\u2019 score does indeed give you a sense of wonderment. The scene where the visitors first lay eyes on the dinosaurs is movie magic.\r\n\r\nRereleased for its 25th anniversary it\u2019s safe to say we rarely have had more fun in the cinema than while watching 'Jurassic Park'.", "This is my idea of a perfect movie. I mean, it's not perfect, perfect, but it's pretty close. To start off the score is just amazing and iconic and really drives the awe of this film. And these characters are developed so quickly but are also so good. All of the actors give fantastic performances. Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, and Richard Attenborough give classic performances and even the supporting actors like Wayne Knight, Samuel L. Jackson, and especially Bob Peck as Muldoon. What really struck me this time I watched it was how the action really doesn't even start until halfway through the movie, and then from there the action is nonstop.\r\n\r\nI think that since it was paced like this, it allows us to get attached to the characters which makes the action so much more impactful and suspenseful. And even with that first hour that is primarily dialogue, it's still so engaging since the script is tightly written, it has some compelling conversations on the control that humans have, is well shot, and has some humor that feels natural in the dialogue and is in character. The humor is never forced in situations that are tense unless it's expected form that character, like Ian Malcolm. \r\n\r\nAnd then that second half... my God, it's so good. This isn't an action movie to me, it's a suspenseful thriller. There's no humans fighting dinosaurs, exploding cars and planes, and the action is used relatively sparingly. The CGI is also used sparingly and only when it is needed. Both the practical effects and CGI look great still. Speilberg really crafted amazing characters, tense scenes like with the Tyrannosaurus breakout and the Raptors in the kitchen, and iconic shots. This was my favorite movie as a kid because of the cool-looking dinosaurs, and is still one of my favorites because of it's insanely great characters and suspenseful scenes.", "MORE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/\r\n\r\nMany films age quite well, but Jurassic Park (1993) undoubtedly holds up better than most. From its memorable score to the still impressive animatronics, without forgetting its iconic characters, Steven Spielberg truly is a magnificent filmmaker. Remains as suspenseful as ever.\r\n\r\nRating: A+", "This is one of relatively few movies that I have watched more than twice, so obviously I like it. My most recent viewing came because I ran across the remastered version and decided to watch it again after many years.\r\n\r\nI was never one of those kids who was into dinosaurs growing up. I was more into DC comic book heroes and their TV counterparts. But I like how realistic monsters and dinosaurs are looking since I started watching these films as an adult. It was awesome the first time I watched it, and Jurassic Park still seems like the finest example of special effects up until that point.\r\n\r\nAs far as the plot and the story details are concerned, however, it is quite ordinary.  A man who doesn\u2019t like children becomes their caretaker when danger threatens them; an embittered consultant dabbles in corporate theft; a wisecracking chaos theorist who proves to be correct in a few predictions, though it is never explained why he was chosen to evaluate the theme park in the first place. And like the security personnel in the old Star Trek episodes, several characters are earmarked for destruction so the the core of characters we are supposed to care about can all survive.\r\n\r\nBut I am not dissing all of this, just saying that the story is a rather ordinary framework to display the awesome graphics of dinosaurs in motion. But the humor is good, Jeff Goldblum is great (but then I even like him in Apartment.com commercials) and it is all well done. It is just that the film will never make one of my top 10 lists and, finally at this late date, I may have watched it for the last time.", "**Overall : Unparalleled storytelling blends nostalgia and terror, producing one of the most extraordinary adventures ever on screen.**\r\n\r\nJurassic Park's groundbreaking special effects blended practical effects with cutting-edge computer-generated imagery, resulting in such realistic creatures that even many modern-day effects.

He chose Shakespeare's farcical comedy **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING**.  I knew one thing going in... Shakespeare's comedies are rarely that funny.  I knew something better coming out.. I could not have been more wrong. This film is not only funny and sexy, it is a treasure.\r\n\r\nThis is the first Branagh film that he utilizes stunt casting - bringing in Hollywood talent into  roles normally filled by Shakespearian actors.  And while it isn't always perfect, there is no complaint.  In fact Michael Keaton, Keanu Reeves and Denzel Washington shine some bright light toward the American talent pool.  Of course, many of Kenneth's _'Shakespeare'_ friends are still along for the ride - Brian Blessed is amongst my favorites.\r\n\r\nBranagh's first major achievement with this film is on his screenplay treatment.  Like his **HENRY V**, he has cut the screenplay down to a much more manageable Hollywood film length. It is taut and efficient. Nothing is missing for the casual Shakespeare fan. Of course the obsessed will find - or _won't_ find a lot of stuff.\r\n\r\nBranagh's second major achievement is shared by others in the cast, especially Emma Thompson.  Their handle of the language and poetry of Shakespeare shifts what is often muddy and confusing dialogue to crystal clear and modern understanding.  In fact you will find yourself smiling through most of their scenes together as they torture each other until their love takes over.\r\n\r\nIn high school readings of any Shakespeare plays, students often get confused as to the social aspect of the stories... They would question why there is a party and why is everyone in the town celebrating it? Why do battles seem to be fought and won amongst only 10 soldiers? Why does it seem that marriages are performed on the same day that the couple first met?  So many questions confuse students and the adults who grow from them.  Branagh's most masterful achievement here is in answering these questions.\r\n \r\nDuring his **HENRY V**, Branagh used an incredibly impressive tracking shot through the death and destruction on the field of Agincourt.  Just as impressive is the finale of **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING**, including the audience in the celebration moving through the community and finally, up into the sky with a grand view of the love and excitement of all that are alive to experience it.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that Kenneth Branagh is a major fan of Shakespeare.  I would venture to say that he is more than a fan, he is an artistic peer."], ["Donald Sutherland has done some dross in his time, but usually only as a guest star. Here he commits himself to the whole thing and I wonder if now, he regrets it. The mind-numbingly daft plot involves alien creatures that resemble flounders with a proboscis, that ride around on the backs of people, whilst controlling what passes for their minds. \"Nivens\" (DS) is determined to capture one of these beasties and get it back to the lab for examination. It has all the production values of a solid television movie and hasn't an original bone in it's body. It is a sort of \"Alien\" meets \"Doctor Who\" themed enterprise that recycles the rather flawed plot far too often, with little sense of jeopardy and the most obvious solution to the extra-terrestrial invasion plan - just don't wear a shirt with an opaque back! It ends pretty much as expected, with a mediocre supporting cast and some unremarkable dialogue to support the flying jelly special effects. Nothing special, this film."], [], ["This is one of Anthony Hopkins' most nuanced and classy performances, depicting the last of a dying breed of upper servants in the stately home of \"Lord Darlington\" (James Fox). It's told by way of a retrospective as he takes some time off from his work as butler to American millionaire \"Lewis\" (Christopher Reeve) and goes for a drive to meet the former housekeeper \"Miss Kenton\" (Emma Thompson). The theme has two threads. The first concerning the peer for whom he worked for a great period of his career. This is a man who believed in what turned out to be a flawed gentlemen's code of honour and decency when it came to dealing with the rise of the Nazis. The second featured a more personal take on his life, reconciling his duties with the failing health of his now under-butler father (Peter Vaughan) as well as his relationship with a determined and new \"Kenton\". The attention to detail on this production is meticulous; the characterisations are convincing and engaging - the unconditional loyalty of \"Stevens\"; the decent naivety of \"Darlington\" and finally, the strong performance from Thompson that acts nicely as a conduit from the days of old to the more modern times where the deference and service culture that gave \"Stevens\" his purpose (and comfort blanket) are now gone. This story offers a wonderful illustration of the how the consequences of WWI started the now inevitable process of change to a social structure that had endured for centuries, exposing the leadership class - which took such a dim view of their underling \"sheep\" as out of touch and, for all their education, no longer fit for purpose: any purpose! It's a gently paced affair and that helps us to engage with this fine adaptation of the Ishiguro novel that, though applied here to the last days of Imperial Britain, could apply to many a nation in what was still a largely family run Europe.", "**It is an excellent film, even if I disagree with the thesis on which it was made.**\r\n\r\nIn the period between the two world wars, the world tried to make sure that there was never again something as destructive and traumatic as the First World War. However, such decisions, very commendable but chimerical and contrary to human nature, failed, as we know: the Second World War will occur just a few years later, almost as a direct consequence of the mismanagement of peace, so hard achieved. However, the UK (and other countries) sought to avoid the new conflict by choosing to ignore everything that was happening in Germany: price inflation, the brutal economic crisis, popular dissatisfaction, the rise of Nazi radicalism and an increasingly brutal, extreme and violent rhetoric.\r\n\r\nLord Darlington, the central figure of this film, is the archetype of a well-bred and intelligent British political class, deeply traumatized by the First World War and more than determined to avoid another one like it. Stanley Baldwin, Neville Chamberlain and a number of other politicians thought alike and sought, by various means, to appease and reach an agreement with Hitler, after which they were heavily criticized for the way in which they did so. Honestly, I can't criticize them. Only those who have never experienced a war can afford not to try to prevent another one from happening in every way, however justifiable and even laudable the reasons behind it may be. Therefore, here begins the fundamental disagreement between the way I think and the way this film was thought and conceived.\r\n\r\nMany, in fact, would think that the butler of Darlington Hall is the key figure in this film. Indeed, he is the protagonist and the main character, impeccably played by the always secure Sir Anthony Hopkins. However, this character's actions and thoughts are strictly determined by her canine loyalty to her aristocratic lord, and the house where he serves. So if His Lordship thinks a certain way, he must be right. And although the film criticizes this loyalty and lack of moral and intellectual independence, I prefer to refrain from doing so. Like Lord Darlington, I also have people who serve me, and I learned to appreciate and value that devoted loyalty, not least because we cannot, nowadays, put anyone to serve inside our homes. Loyalty, honesty, respect and good understanding between servant and master are, more than any contract or payment, the basis of a good relationship in such a situation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Sir Anthony Hopkins, the film features an excellent work by Dame Emma Thompson, who makes a good counterpoint with the butler: if one is reason and traditionalism, the other is innovation, breaking conventions, emotion. Therefore, they complement each other and create a good friendship, despite being very different and often not agreeing. The film takes a nice approach to this relationship, making the subplot between the two a highly important point in the overall story. The film also features good interpretations by James Fox, Christopher Reeve and Hugh Grant.\r\n\r\nOn a more technical level, we must highlight the choice of filming locations, which built a fictional Darlington Hall from some of the most beautiful and significant English manor houses, which makes the film an authentic tour of these unique pieces of heritage and culture. Inside some of them, you can still feel the British spirit, with its chivalry, sobriety and stoicism. Cinematography is the standard used in 1993 and does not bring any surprises, although the camera work deserves a positive note. The sets, and especially the costumes and props, deserve to be carefully looked for the way they recreate the period. The soundtrack is another point that also deserves to be highlighted, being emotional and striking without imposing itself in a strident way."], ["**The intricate world of chess, in the shadow of one of its most controversial masters.**\r\n\r\nThere is, in the world of sport \u2013 and for all intents and purposes, competitive chess turns out to be like a sport \u2013 a certain obsession with the stars, and their replacement when they go away. This is perhaps most visible in football: Messi has often been described as the new Maradona, to give you an example of what I'm talking about. This film follows a bit of the same logic: after having a chess grand master who won an important world tournament against the unbeatable Russians (and in the middle of the Cold War), the film takes us to the world of junior chess, following the steps of a young prodigy who could eventually be the \u201csuccessor\u201d to that famous player, Bobby Fisher.\r\n\r\nLittle note: being a genius doesn't mean being a good person or a person you'll like. Bobby Fisher is already dead, and he died relatively young, but he guided his public life and his career by unpredictable behavior, enormous eccentricity and statements to journalists that are controversial, to say the least. He held quite radical world views, he was, it seems, anti-Semitic and a Holocaust denier. Fisher's statements about the US, his home country \u2013 which he left many years ago \u2013 are truly incendiary and critical. All it takes is a little internet research to verify this.\r\n\r\nI don't know how popular chess is nowadays, but here in Portugal it is common and very popular at school level, more as a recreational activity, not as a competition. I remember, in my school days, leaving the classroom and spending almost every break playing chess against my friends. And we took the game seriously, with pleasure and enthusiasm. We were aware of the complexity of the game, but we never worried about being ferociously good, just having fun. But I think anyone who knows how to play chess understands how challenging a game it can be.\r\n\r\nThe film has an excellent cast. Max Pomeranc, despite being very young, is a likeable protagonist who seems torn between genius and normality. It makes him approachable and gives him a fascinating weakness for someone so obviously smart, and the young actor had the ability to understand the character in this way, and balance himself in this rich personality. Next to us, we have two great actors \u2013 Ben Kingsley and Joe Mantegna \u2013 who give us very successful jobs. For me, this film is one of Mantegna's best. Joan Allen also does a satisfying but less interesting job, and Laurence Fishburne could have been better used.\r\n\r\nSteven Zaillian had the brains to give us a film filled with intellect, intelligence and good feelings. The script is well written, and the dialogues are quite good. The choice of filming locations, sets and costumes, all help to build a familiar, friendly, very elegant film. There are no great effects, the film doesn't require them, but there is an effective soundtrack, very discreet, and reasonably well done cinematography."], ["**Effective, functional and elegant, it has a script that I didn't like very much, and it has aged a little badly, but it remains an endearing film.**\r\n\r\nThis is surely one of the most famous romantic comedies that came out during the 90's, and one of the films that helped to popularize Tom Hanks, showing the world that he could be a serious actor and do more interesting things besides comedy. The film begins with a man and his young son moving to Seattle to deal with a mourning process. There, the child begins to pressure his father to find a girlfriend, to the point of calling a radio program where the father tells his story, touching a young journalist from Baltimore who is about to marry a man she doesn't love.\r\n\r\nThe script relies heavily on Platonism: the two main characters do not know each other, and only the radio broadcast and the exchange of letters truly connects them. Neither has any real reason to look for the other (Hanks' character sees physical distance as an obstacle, and Ryan's character is already committed). In the end, it is the tenacity and stubbornness of a child that leads them to find each other. Based purely on instinct, which is an illogical and irrational argument for an adult to make his decisions. For that reason, and despite recognizing the film's qualities, I didn't particularly appreciate it. I see and understand the attempt to create a contemporary romantic fable here, but fables don't really seem to work these days. For me, this one didn't work.\r\n\r\nThe film's great strength is in the excellent performances of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The two are still quite young, trying to take advantage of the opportunity to achieve higher flights in more profitable and attractive projects for their careers. Hanks had mostly done comedy up until this point, and was determined to showcase his abilities in other projects. There is no doubt that he knew how to do it and show a deeper, more sensitive and emotional side that was not evident in his work so far. Ryan was also very competent in her role. Ross Malinger was also pretty good.\r\n\r\nThe film is not a great visual spectacle. It's a 90's movie that hasn't aged well and doesn't put much effort into the visuals. Proof of this are the graphics on that US map, which look like an arcade game. The cinematography is dull, and the colors washed out, but that was commonplace and routine in films of this era, and I take that reasonably well. The film tries to compensate us with excellent scenery and cityscapes of Seattle and New York, which is always effective, and with an excellent ending on top of the Empire State Building. The soundtrack makes a smart bet on songs by Sinatra, Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole, Celine Dion, Carly Simon, Roy Rogers and others. Most of the songs are well known and popular.", "I can't say I had a fun time with <em>'Sleepless in Seattle'</em>.\r\n\r\nPost-watching, I was unsure how I felt about it. The whole set-up and how the story is portrayed is weird, the fact that the two characters in what supposed to be a romcom don't even properly meet until the final act is an odd choice, like don't get me wrong I can see it working but here it didn't for me... especially with one side giving stalker vibes, which adds to the weirdness.\r\n\r\nI also wasn't convinced by the two leads, in both their performances and in their suitability - obviously the latter is hampered by the fact we barely seem them together so they cannot show any chemistry. Tom Hanks is the standout but only just, Meg Ryan tries though her character is just a bit mundane; and is in my opinion better suited to Bill Pullman's Walter, even though the film attempts to show us the opposite. No-one else onscreen sticks out, though credit to youngster Ross Malinger.\r\n\r\nIt's a nae from me, both Hanks and Ryan have thankfully done much better."], ["**Planet Noir**\r\n\r\nI declare _Blade Runner_ the best sci-fi movie of all time. Arguments? No? Okay. So long. Please upvote the guest book on your way out.\r\n\r\nWAIT! There's more. At the risk of whistling conspiracies and setting off inappropriate vibrations in your slacks, you see, this Ridley K. Dick concoction is going on right now. While we're all transfixed by the endlessly goofy droppings from the web, forever staring down and swiping things on our smarty-pants phones, retweeting selfies of infinitely mirrored  selfies; proliferating at light speed, every aspect of humanity is being replicated, perfected, mechanized, optimized, upgraded, fortified, robofied, Googlized, quantumized, DNA'd and NSA'd and will soon converge to fall upon and supplant us, and Harrison Ford, despite looking trim for his years, will be too old to stop it! And the irony to end all ironies is that we, as the irresponsibly arrogant, over-infested and narcissistic caretakers and consumers, and the colossal defecators of this broken-down, flea-bag of a planet, are entirely fundamentally responsible. No, the irony of all ironies is that a world exclusively dominated by self-correcting technocratic cyborgs with zettabytes of artificial intelligence will be a vast improvement. The androids are saving the planet! AHHH, run for your life! Blade Runner is both an expired cautionary tale and emerging utopian fantasy.\r\n\r\nOh, you knew this already? Very well. Carry on. Enjoy your self-driving cars and virtual nature tours.", "Retirement - Replicants - Resplendent. \r\n\r\nBlade Runner is one of those glorious films that has gained in popularity the older it has gotten. Ridley Scott's follow up to the critical and commercial darling that was Alien, was by and large considered a flop and damned for not being a science fiction action blockbuster. There was of course some fans who recognised its many many strengths during the initial weeks of its 1982 release, but many who now claim to have loved it back then are surely looking sheepishly in the mirror these days, for the hard-core minority of 82 fans remember it very differently. \r\n\r\nRemember the spider that lived outside your window? Orange body, green legs. Watched her build a web all summer, then one day there's a big egg in it. The egg hatched... \r\n\r\nAnyway, that's by the by, the point being that a film can sometimes be ahead of its time, misunderstood or miss-marketed, Scott's masterpiece is one such case. Story, adapted in fashion from Philip K. Dick's story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Is pretty simple. It's a dystopian Los Angeles, 2019, and there are four genetically engineered Replicants - human in appearance - in the city, which is illegal. They were designed to work on off-world colonies, any Replicant who defies the rules will be retired by special police assassins known as Blade Runners, and Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is on this case. A case that will prove to have many layers... \r\n\r\nA new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies! A chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure! \r\n\r\nRidley Scott gets to have all his cakes to eat here, managing to blend intriguing science fiction with film noir. That the visuals are outstanding is a given, even the film's most hardest critics grudgingly acknowledge this to be an eye popping piece of visual class - the mention of eyes is on purpose since it's forms a key narrative thread. That it is awash with eye orgasms has led to critics calling a charge of beauty over substance, but the deep themes at work here tickle the brain and gnaw away at the senses. \r\n\r\nQuite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave. \r\n\r\nMood is set at perpetually bleak, a classic film noir trait, and paced accordingly. Scott isn't here to perk anyone up, he's here to ask questions whilst filtering his main characters through a prism of techno decay, of humanity questioned to the max, for a film so stunning in visuals, it's surprisingly nightmarish at its core. The emotional spine is ever present, troubled when violence shows its hand, but it's there posing an intriguing question as the Replicants kill because they want to live. And this as our antagonist, Deckard (Ford a brilliantly miserable Marlowe clone), starts to fall for Rachael (a sensually effective femme fatale portrayal), one of his retirement targets. \r\n\r\nTears in the Rain. \r\n\r\nAs Rutger Hauer (never better) saunters more prominently into the story as head Replicant Roy Batty, the pic evolves still more. Haunting lyricism starts pulsing away in conjunction with Vangelis' rib shaking techno score, while Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography brings Scott's masterful visions to life, key characters one and all. Visuals, aural splendour and dark thematics - so just what does it mean to be human? - Indeed, curl as one in a magnificent cinematic achievement. A number of cuts of the film are out there, and all of them have fans, but Scott's Final Cut is the one where he had total artistic control, and the scrub up job across the board is quite literally breath taking. 10/10", "The movie's story didn't do much for me, however I did find parts of it confusing. After watching it I found out that I watched the \"Final Cut\" which has a completely different ending and different implications from the theatrical release. I didn't understand those implications...I needed to look up the ending online. Whether that's because the movie is confusing or I'm dumb, I can't say. But my friend I watched it with didn't understand it either.\r\n\r\nAfter looking up the end's meaning, I did find it a bit more satisfying. But the main reason this movie is worth watching is the visuals. Not sure I'd watch it again any time soon though.", "Some people will say this classic sci-fi \"has nothing to offer other than overrated cult-status\". To that, I would respond, \"it has Rutger Hauer on a rooftop, and that's enough for me\".\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._\r\n\r\n(3.5 for the Theatrical Cut, 4.0 for the Final Cut)", "I have only viewed the Final Cut, and judging by reviews elsewhere this is possibly the most complete and satisfying version of them all.\r\n\r\nI cannot truthfully say I am in awe with this film as I found it quite plodding at times. But having said that the visionary aspects, the bleak surrounds, and the air of hopelessness that permeates throughout most of the film is exceptionally well done. \r\n\r\nI would hazard a guess it wasn't a big success at the box office back in 82/83 chiefly because of the likes of ET, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Return of the Jedi and quite a few other adventure/SF films of the time pushing this film into a dark corner. Another reason could be because it was too slow for those brought up on Star Wars; or just too unengaging for those looking at it from a murder-mystery perspective  (I recall reading that the original version had Ford do a Marlowesque voice over).\r\n\r\nAn impressive film for all that, with some delightful special effects, and a decent performance from Ford. But of course for me the true delight was Roy's \"Time to Die\" speech at the end. If there was an Oscar for best speech in a film, he would have won it with ease!", "This time, it is Ridley Scott's turn to offer us his prognostication of a future wherein corporate America has, ostensibly benignly, introduced the ultimate in labour saving devices - androids called \"replicants\" - which have a look and feel of people about them. These \"Nexus\" creations can turn their hands to just about anything, but when the latest off-world models rebel, all of their cousins become outlawed and it falls to the \"Blade Runners\" to track them down and destroy them. \"Deckard\" (Harrison Ford) is one such operator who is called back out of his retirement to identify four of these highly adaptable and intelligent robots and this perilous task takes him to the heart of their manufacturer run by the fiendishly clever but unscrupulous \"Tyrell\" (Joe Turkel), and into a web of duplicity surrounding their controlling protocols and maybe even a fifth, almost impossible to recognise \"replicant\", whom - unlike it's contemporaries - has no idea that it isn't human. Ford is on cracking form here, as is Rutger Hauer - the android leader \"Batty\" and the dark, frequently rainy imagery contributes wonderfully to this seedily presented story of greed and manipulation set amongst a grittily dank and hostile environment that offers little, visually anyway, by way of hope or relief. It has a film-noir look and feel to it, and Scott keeps it moving well, keeps the dialogue sparse - though impactful, and the whole thing develops cinematographically some of the pretty profound questions brought up in the original Philip Dick novel about just what constitutes humanity. Just shy of two hours - it flies by, especially on a big screen where the visuals and audio still work wonders.", "**A magnificent work, if we consider the time when it was released and the technical resources that existed.**\r\n\r\nHonestly, I didn't expect much from this movie. It was a film that was not successful in theaters and that only took off when it went to VHS, acquiring admirers since then and becoming one of the most respected films of all time. Set in a profoundly dystopian Los Angeles, it raises many philosophical and sociological questions around human nature, the course of humanity, our relationship with technology and our morality in general.\r\n\r\nWatching this film in 2022 was funny because the action of the film, released in 1982, takes place in the year 2019. That is, it was set in a future that, now, is past for me and never materialized (and I'm glad). The film's plot is not easy: humanity colonized other planets while destroying Earth, and created very realistic human androids while destroying itself. However, the androids, called replicants, got out of control, and are now hunted and killed, or used for the most vile purposes. The metaphors are clear, there is a lot of philosophical material, and it leaves us thinking for a long time.\r\n\r\nRidley Scott gives us, with this film, one of his masterpieces. The film is magnificent in every way, and it is worth giving it the time it needs to surprise us. It creates a neo-noir plot where nobody is innocent or angelic, and where danger is everywhere. The lighting, the shutters on the windows, the indispensable \u201cfemme fatale\u201d, all the classic components of noir are here, in a frankly colorful film with sets and landscapes that combine the most grandiose futurism with the decadence and dirt of the world we destroy. The dialogues are memorable and full of deeply symbolic moments. The characters are rich, dense and complex, and it's extraordinary to think that we still don't really understand, after several decades, whether the main character is human or not.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it seems that time has not passed for this film: if we think that it is from the early 80s, it is incredible that it is so visually powerful and that it has such good cinematography. It looks like a movie made ten years ago. The sets and costumes couldn't be better, and the special effects are stunning. The soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, is smooth and hypnotic.\r\n\r\nAdding to all this, we have Harrison Ford, in one of the most underrated works of his career. He does a really good job, and he deserved more recognition for that. Sean Young also deserves a round of applause for the way he brought his character to life, a replicant who really thinks she's human. There are other very good actors, and we can highlight Rutger Hauer in particular, but they do not match this duo of artists.", "Experienced on the big screen in the Everyman Cinema was just about the best way to loose myself in this spectacular SCI FI \u00a0masterpiece. Without Doubt \u201cBlade Runner\u201d has been extremely influential since its original release over 40 years ago and it\u2019s technical wonder and effects are still as inspiring today. Doug Trumble\u2019s effects, Larry Paull\u2019s production design and the downtown L.A. location shots all work so well in creating a retro- fitted future.\r\n\r\nObviously a different cut to the original release , \u201cBlade Runner: The Final cut \u201c removes the voiceover and original ending so criticised by audiences and critics during its theatrical run in 1982. This newer ( 2007 ) ending elevates the movie to something more spectacular and wonderful. A group of rebel replicants , feared dangerous to humans, \u00a0have escaped and landed on earth. Earth is a cyber, neon, futuristic , overpopulated, uncaring environment, with a population that has little time for anything other than existence. \u00a0Unlike these humans of the future, the replicants show far more empathy and humanity towards each other. \u00a0It is in the the dying moments of a replicant that we come to learn of the true nature of the rebel groups attempt to escape to earth. It is simply a quest that most humans try and attain, the desire to extend life.

The animation is wonderfully detailed, dark and enjoyable with plenty of characters including a mad scientist as well as a mummy, the two-faced mayor and plenty of witches and demons. Not for the first time, Tim Burton shows a visionary imagination that I couldn't help but smile at - and coupled with a marvellous score (and lead vocal) from Danny Elfman we are presented with a thoroughly engaging Christmas story with a bit of a twist.

It stars Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Michael Rapaport, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Bronson Pinchot and Saul Rubinek. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Jeffery L.

Marriage is quick but as the whirlwind romance gathers apace, complications quickly follow in the form of psycho drug dealers and the mob! \r\n\r\nIt's still speculated on how True Romance would have panned out had Tarantino directed his own screenplay, but really in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter. For True Romance is a wildly exciting fusion of lovers on the lam premise with violence a go go thrills. \r\n\r\nDirector Scott did a bang up job bringing Tarantino's screenplay to life, even making a couple of narrative changes that suits (QT agrees) the picture no end. People often get hung up on the fact that Scott had previously helmed Top Gun, Beverly hills Cop II and Days of Thunder, citing these as reasons that Scott was wrong for the material, yet the film he did immediately before True Romance was The Last Boy Scout, a thrilling and muscular actioner that pings with sharp savvy dialogue scripted by Shane Black. It was the perfect trial run for True Romance, and Scott proved to be a wise and cohesive choice for the material. He also expertly marshalled a large ensemble cast, garnering career high turns from Slater and Arquette in the process. \r\n\r\nAlmost everything clicks into place on True Romance, it never lacks for kinetic thrills or edge of the seat drama. In turn it likes to grab you around the throat with some wince inducing violence, cunningly drawing you in to root for a couple of lovers who will do anything for each other, while simultaneously causing carnage for all they come into contact with. There's odd ball characters galore (Oldman and Pitt excelling in this area), exquisite set-pieces and dialogue so sharp you could cut a steak with it. From conversations between Clarence and his imaginary Elvis (Kilmer) mentor, to iconography unbound with one of the 90s great sequences that sees Walken's mob boss verbally joust with Hopper as Clarence's stoic father, it's a film as rich in the art of vocal acting as it is in eye splintering gloss. All that and it's a clinically beautiful love story as well! \r\n\r\nA wet dream fantasy of QT for sure, and if you wanna be churlish? Then there should have been more room made for Sizemore and Penn's glorious coppers. Hell we could even complain about the editing being a touch too slam-bang at times\u2026But nah!

Jackson, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, Bronson Pinchotand and Saul Rubinek.\r\n\r\n\"True Romance\" (1993) is a crime drama/thriller/romance and black comedy directed by Tony Scott (younger brother of Ridley) and written by Quentin Tarantino. The latter sold the script to fund his first movie \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d (1992). It contains the ultra-violence/gore that Tarantino is known for, along with his satirical, comic book style that makes it more amusing than shocking. \r\n\r\nWhile the all-star cast is incredible and there are several great scenes, something keeps \u201cTrue Romance\u201d from the top tier of \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d (1994) and \u201cJackie Brown\u201d (1997). I suppose it doesn\u2019t help that the protagonist\u2019s sudden transformation isn\u2019t convincing, not to mention that what he does is unnecessary and perilous (i.e. stupid), which turns him into a bit of a creepy nutzoid. But that\u2019s just me.\r\n\r\nImagine being blown away by the greatest album by a band and then purchasing their previous album, which is good, but not in the same league. You like it, but you\u2019re also a little letdown.

Quentin\u2019s original version would\u2019ve worked better, preferably directed by him.    \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in Detroit and the Los Angeles area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "This is a sort of pre-Tarantino Tarantino movie. The story I read is that he rewrote a script for a co-worker, and he didn\u2019t end up directing it, so it is both his and not completely his work. But it is a violent quirky films like many of his other ones.  I had to smile when i read the brief summary of the plot on this site. Rarely does a movie blurb capture the essence of a movie this well: \u201cClarence marries hooker Alabama, steals cocaine from her pimp, and tries to sell it in Hollywood, while the owners of the coke try to reclaim it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dialogue rings true and there is a chemistry between the romantic leads. It is star studded also, though the actors play secondary roles to make for quite a talented group of character actors/actresses. I highly recommend it.\r\n\r\nOh, and there is one other aspect of the movie that intrigued me and contributed to how much I like it. I haven\u2019t seen it mentioned in other reviews here or elsewhere, and that is the soundtrack. It was composed by Hans Zimmer, who is widely recognized as one of the best movie composers. If you have seen the movie \u201cBadlands\u201d with Martin Sheen and Cissy Spacek, you will hear a startling resemblance (almost identically so) between the opening themes of the two movie. \r\n\r\nThe music for Badlands, also a road movie featuring a killer and his girlfriend, was written by Carl Orff, taken from a study piece he apparently wrote for other composers and performers to use as a learning or development piece. I only know this because back then in pre-Google times I searched for weeks tracking down where the music came from, as Badlands did not release a soundtrack album.  You can also notice the voiceover ending for both movies, recited by the girlfriends, are also very similar. I assume this is done as a tribute to the earlier film.", "**A film where love is unbelievable, the characters are unlikely, and the action scenes are brutal and quite intense.**\r\n\r\nThis is one of those films that you shouldn't watch with your family: it's full of violent scenes, foul dialogue full of profanity, several sex scenes, among other heavy features. The story isn't exactly nice either: during his birthday, a seemingly ordinary man meets a seductive woman and the two get very involved. We learn that she is a prostitute, and was hired to be with him that night. They decide to escape, but are forced to kill her pimp and take with them a suitcase full of pure cocaine.\r\n\r\nFor me, the film's biggest problem wasn't the violence (Tarantino uses it regularly and is considered brilliant), but rather the implausibility of the story: I wouldn't believe in love at first sight with a prostitute, I find the idea implausible, and the same can be said about the idea of a frail boy, with a perfectly ordinary life, becoming in a few hours a brutal murderer and potential drug dealer. These are things that don't fit, but that the film takes advantage of to create a kind of \u201cRomeo and Juliet Bang Bang\u201d.\r\n\r\nThere are several well-known names in the cast. For me, the best performance came from Gary Oldman, who is extraordinarily good in the role of a violent pimp. I wish that his participation was not so brief. Patricia Arquette is sexy when she's almost naked, and that was put to full use. As an actress, she did what she could, but she was given such bad material and such an unbelievable character that she couldn't do much. In turn, Christian Slater is not a good actor. At least, I think that he lost itself a lot after \u201cName of the Rose\u201d. Here, he keeps the same persona he presented in \u201cHeathers\u201d, but without such an intelligent script to base it on. The actor did the job that was possible with bad material and a very bad character. Chris Walken is good in the role of the big villain: he knows how to be cold and appear threatening. Val Kilmer and Brad Pitt make brief appearances, but I doubt they want to remember this work, where they were very far from the shape we are used to.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film stands out for the avalanche of good special effects it used in the action and shooting scenes, which are deeply crafted and stylized. Fans of action films will definitely enjoy this, and the climactic scene is worthy of an anthology. The rest ends up not really interesting and not having much relevance."], [], [], ["If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nAladdin is one of Disney\u2018s most adored classics, being the indisputable favorite of many, many fans. The Lion King will always have that spot in my heart, but I also visited this story set in Agrabah dozens of times. Now, with the 2019\u2019s remake about to premiere, I rewatched it last night and, once again, I fell in love. Honestly, I didn\u2019t remember how funny and entertaining it is! It still holds up incredibly well, even though the film was released almost 30 years ago. The animation still looks stunning and fluid, but it\u2019s the musical numbers and the voice work from the cast that makes this movie one of Disney\u2018s best.\r\n\r\nAs it\u2019s known, Robin Williams shines in a role that stands out from his brilliant filmography, as his career-best interpretation of an animated character. Genie is one of the most versatile figures of Disney and Williams spreads out his wings of creativeness and imagination, delivering a phenomenal voice performance of the hilarious blue entity. From his seamless imitations to the simple yet extremely difficult tone changes, he gives everything. Genie appears every time the film most needs him, which is when the pacing starts to drop and needs something to pump it back up while moving the plot forward. He could merely be a plot device, but thankfully the writers gave him an unique personality with his own motivations, making us not only laugh with him but genuinely care about his destiny.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the other main attribute of this movie: its writing. The dialogues feel realistic, grounded, and there are no real exposition scenes, besides the musical sequences, which are also meant to serve that purpose. Aladdin and Jasmine lived utterly opposite lives, and both wish to change. Each wants the other\u2019s life experiences and adventures, which provides some amazing moments between these characters. I still wish their relationship had more time to develop (something I hope the remake will do), as well as Jafar\u2018s motivations. It\u2019s 1992, and it\u2019s an animated film, but the cliche villain who wants power because \u201cI\u2019m the bad guy\u201d never quite worked. However, the menacing and dark voice of John Freeman sells this character. In addition to these protagonists, Abu and Iago are two comedy sources that perfectly work, all the time.\r\n\r\nMusically, there is no way of denying the cultural impact that the Aladdin songs had. From Arabian Nights to A Whole New World, every song is filled with rich lyrics, great rhythm, and a beautiful tone. Not only are these able to develop the character or move the plot forward, but they also help the story never to break its fast pacing. Almost 30 years later, the animation quality still looks striking, and there are so many memorable backgrounds and visually outstanding settings. Disney\u2018s 90s decade is an absolute treasure in movie history: Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, Tarzan, Aladdin and a few more animated diamonds (in the rough) that went a bit under the radar. \r\n\r\nAll of these will definitely get a live-action remake (some already have), and I welcome all of them. Stop trying to boycott something that will only help the new generations to fall in love with the same characters that we did. Live-action isn\u2019t here to offend our childhood or produce cheap copies of our favorite films! It isn\u2019t here to replace the originals but to honor them instead by delivering modern takes on stories that impacted us on a deep emotional level, and that will try to do the same for our children, grandsons and nephews. Are they going to be better than the source material? Worse? It doesn\u2019t really matter as long as they keep the original\u2019s essence and the traits that made us adore these unforgettable characters. And, please, stop the \u201cthey\u2019re doing these remakes for money\u201d argument. That can literally be said about every movie in the history of cinema. Unfortunately, entertainment is a business, it always was, and it always will be. Move on.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Aladdin is a beautifully passionate story about how two incredibly different people with two completely different lifestyles can come to love each other by who they truly are. Robin Williams is a perfectly polished diamond and his scenes alone superbly elevate this film. One of Disney most impactful classics, filled with memorable songs, well-written characters, and stunning animation, which holds up remarkably still to this day. Despite some nitpicks regarding Jafar and the protagonists\u2019 relationship, Aladdin is undoubtedly an unbelievably precious gem which continues (and will continue) to be loved by newer generations all around the world.\r\n\r\nRating: A", "Certainly one of the better animations from the reinvigorated 1990's Disney Studio. It still has the schmaltzy, over sentimental treatment that seems to torment me every time I watch a Disney film, but the characterisations of the \"Genie\" (Robin Williams\") and the evil \"Jafar\" (Jonathan Freeman) are great as are the rest of the vocal acting talent (rather than using established stars). The script is punchy, well written and has plenty for folks of all ages to engage with. The songs are well paced and amusing and nowhere near as shouty as we have become used to in later animations. All in all this sits well as en enjoyable take on an an enjoyable Arabian Nights style story.", "It's a classic. Grew up watching Aladdin all the time. Great movie still."], ["Terminator 2 is basically one of the greatest films of all time, its an absolute must watch if you like Science Fiction, Action, or even Comedy films. It could have been so bad, but the film somehow pulls it off with crazy stunts, an amazing cast and a great story. \r\n\r\nThe film really tackles the fate of humanity straight on which gets you thinking about our path as a species but also what we can do today to change things. The story takes you on a journey which is one of the most believable time travel movies of all time.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes are fantastic, with wall to wall fighting, car chases and military maneuvers that will keep you on the edge of your seat. That's mixed with a great cast and brilliant story telling from the directory. I would say its even better than the first movie which is also a classic.\r\n\r\nOverall I have probably seen this movie 20 or 30 times over the last 25 years(go is it that long!!) and still don't get bored. Its a timeless classic that I urge everyone to watch.", "While I am in that minority which believes it is actually the first _Terminator_ movie which is the best of the franchise, don't let that for one minute convince you I don't absolutely love _Judgement Day_. It's honestly pretty crazy to me how just bonkers good these first two _Terminator_ movies are. Especially when you consider how completely every single sequel managed to miss the mark.\r\n\r\nI like to imagine that in the Good Timeline, where everything isn't Terrible\u2122, this movie is exactly the same, but the trailer doesn't spoil the twist about Robert Patrick being a Terminator and Arnie being a good guy. I know that they also spoil the twist about who's a Terminator and who's not and who's a bad guy and who's not in the trailers for the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th too, but I'm pretty sure that in the Good Timeline those never got made, so whatever.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it._", "Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is everything the original was turned up one notch.  Now Arnold is a caring unfeeling robot, and we missed a whole movie where Sarah Connor went hard into training.\r\n\r\nThis has twists, escapes, a liquid terminator, better special and practical effects, some big explosions, active discussion of how to change the future, and some really iconic moments.\r\n\r\nThe movie isn't chatty in the traditional sense, once Arnold gets involved, all the dialogue outside the asylum is very much to mechanically move the plot forward.  The terminators don't voluntary \"chat\", they more vomit exposition dialogue.\r\n\r\nWhile I'll always remember this as a great movie, it isn't without its flaws.  Hearing John's pre-pubescent voice cracking almost made me turn it off, and I know I found a couple of (small) problems while I was watching, but I couldn't remember them by the end of the movie, so they're clearly not that important.  I may have been a bad foley sound on a weapon, and probably something that the T-800 that didn't seem robo-talk enough.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't know who isn't going to like this movie:  it even has a low kill count.", "So, it is time to review the last good Terminator movie.\r\n\r\nWhen T3 came out, I swear that people forgot it was even released... but at least it felt like it belonged in the Terminator franchise.\r\n\r\nWhen Salvation dropped, it felt like it fit as well, but it was an MCG film, so it also felt like Terminator meets Mickey Mouse.\r\n\r\nAnd when Terminator Typo was released, it kind of did it's best to completely alienate all the fans that the franchise had developed over the years.\r\n\r\nBut this one, well, this one actually was great. The Robert Patrick T-1000 liquid metal thing looked amazing, Patrick acted ominous and frightening, and seemed like a legit threat despite the size difference between he and Arnold.\r\n\r\nAnd in the process the T-1000 managed to produce some truly creepy visuals.\r\n\r\nAnd this John Connor, Edward Furlong, was absolutely amazing. You really got the sense from him that he could be the man that leads the rebellion in the future.\r\n\r\nAnd, Sarah Connor was buff, and upped her game as the heroine that could do, well, actually do the action she was required to preform. And not only that she was creepy and obsessed as well. She looked and acted like the kind of survivalist that would train the future savior of the world.\r\n\r\nIt all came together as a brilliant move with old Arnold playing the good guy this time, and, though it was an obvious bank on his star power, they pulled it off so no one would care. Right down to the first meeting where John didn't know if he could be trusted or not.\r\n\r\nIt was a fantastic story with fantastic visuals, and it all made of a stellar and entertaining watch.", "Behold what we like to call the Greatest Action Movie Ever Made, and for good reason. For me this sits without a doubt as one of the best movies (and movie sequels) I've ever seen. The action scenes, action set pieces, practical (and visual) effects are truly incredible for their time and still hold up today. Solid 10/10, highly recommend the full 2h 33m extended cut.", "I'm never really a fan of kids in movies, but Edward Furlong turns in some attitude here with his performance as the ten year old \"John Connor\". Turns out that he is the target of the the latest \"Skynet\" plot to destroy the resistance to their impending world domination (in a worryingly close 2029!). They have sent a new, improved, \"T1000\" (Robert Patrick) back in time to throttle him. Luckily, his future self has had the presence of mind to send one of the original models (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back on protection detail. As the devastation mounts and the bodies pile up, the young man convinces his protector to get his mother out of her secure institution - the authorities weren't convinced about her stories of futuristic \"terminator\" robots after last time - and also, to stop routinely killing people! It took James Cameron quite a while to put this sequel together, and it is almost as good as the original. Loads of action, some great visual and pyrotechnic effects as well as some quite engaging comedy moments that allow the story to deliver a surprising amount of characterisation for an action movie. You do feel just the tiniest bit invested in them, and though I did find the denouement dragged out just a little, it's a solidly entertaining piece of big screen cinema that allows a man who really cannot act to own the screen. Great fun."], ["One of my all-time favorite movies.  I can't begin to remember how many times I've seen it.  And I'll watch it again.  Kevin Costner gives a compelling performance, but so does the entire cast.  One gets a great sense of who the Lakota were and are.  Respect.", "I watched the extended version of this film, and I just have to say, any film that can run for FOUR HOURS and not come out the other end as a boring pile of garbage, is worthy of some pretty serious praise. That said, _Dances with Wolves_ is not really in my wheelhouse, and although it held my attention I can't see myself probably ever watching it again. Costner knows what he's about, and that's great, but a four-hour film about American history with strong romance elements is never going to blow me away.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "There are two actor of recent years that I really struggle with. One is Tom Hanks, the other is Kevin Costner. His monotonic narrative as he conveys this story via his journal makes this otherwise breathtakingly beautiful story frequently a real plod. He is \"Lt. Dunbar\" who after a very close shave with the Confederate troops during the US Civil War is posted to a far outpost where he finds himself living a solitary existence with only a wolf (\"Two Socks\") for company. That is until a passing warrior gets a glimpse of him at his bath and runs a mile. What now ensues is a gently paced story depicting his developing relationship with his neighbouring Sioux tribe. This film features a memorable John Barry score to accompany some fine cinematography, and the efforts from Graham Greene (\"Kicking Bird\") and a slew of other native American actors is excellent. It's just Kevin. He was the power being the production, and certainly had some skill directing it - but his acting... It is so soporific. He simply doesn't convey well the senses of loneliness, fear and joy that his character experiences as he gradually becomes subsumed into a new - sometimes rather brutal - identity. The story demonstrates and exposes the prevailing attitudes of both cultures towards the other, of their suspicions and mistrust - and were the \"Dunbar\" role to have been portrayed by a more heavyweight screen presence, then we could have had a memorable movie rather than just a long one. It is still good, though - just could have been doing with more oomph from the star."], ["Unlike a lot of viewers, I first saw _The Silence of the Lambs_ at five years old. So, for me, _The Silence of the Lambs_ is a childhood favorite. Some would say I had an unusual childhood, in this age where some people actually **avoid** R-rated movies like the plague. The fact that I saw _Something Wild_, which Jonathan Demme directed five years before _The Silence of the Lambs_, as well as the original _Alien_ (alone at that), at the same age probably indicates that they were okay with me watching pretty much anything that wasn't rated X, though, honestly, I've **never** had any interest in that stuff. It was probably due to the fact that, like the movie's protagonist, I don't \"spook easily,\" and many so-called \"scary\" movies, including this one, never scared me, but (many of them) definitely thrilled me. Granted, I'd seen _Saving Private Ryan_ a few months before, which probably gave me a strong stomach. Well, enough about my wild, albeit fun, childhood. How does _The Silence of the Lambs_ hold up all these years later? For me personally, _The Silence of the Lambs_ is every bit as good as it was the first time I saw it at five years old.\r\n\r\nOn the off chance you don't already know the plot by now, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a rookie FBI agent with a degree in psychology who is called from training by her boss Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) in the middle of a string of murders by a man nicknamed \"Buffalo Bill\" (Ted Levine) who skins his victims, all of whom happen to be women. Crawford tells her to interview the psychotic Dr. Hannibal \"the Cannibal\" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in prison, hoping he might have an answer of some kind. Lecter brushes her off. After Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of a senator is kidnapped, Lecter agrees to give Starling information about Buffalo Bill on the condition that she tell him personal information about herself.\r\n\r\nIf I had to pick the greatest Best Picture Oscar winner ever, it would most likely be _The Silence of the Lambs_. Well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, it's definitely my favorite.\r\n\r\nLet's look at the acting to start. Jodie Foster, unsurprisingly, won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as Starling. Foster plays Starling as a little scared yet strong at the same time, definitely not a coward as Julianne Moore later played the character in the movie _Hannibal_, and definitely not someone who would turn cannibal as Thomas Harris wrote the character as doing in the novel Hannibal. Movie or novel, in my honest opinion, the Clarice Starling depicted in _Hannibal_ is an insult to what this Clarice Starling stands for. As we find out about what's been nagging Starling since childhood, Foster plays it especially well where another actress may have overdone it.\r\nAnthony Hopkins, like Foster, won an Oscar for his performance as Lecter, and I speak for a lot of people, if not everybody, when I say it was also well-deserved. Hopkins plays Lecter as brilliant yet insane, making him one of the more interesting villains in movie history.\r\nScott Glenn plays Crawford very well for the time he's onscreen.\r\nTed Levine plays \"Buffalo Bill\" as straight up crazy, and does a very good job of making us hate him.\r\nBrooke Smith is only supposed to play Catherine Martin as scared and she does - with dead-on accuracy.\r\n\r\nTed Tally won a well-deserved Oscar for his screenplay, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel of the same name. Tally doesn't feel the need to focus on violence and gore, which is one of the movie's strengths. Instead he focuses on the characters, and I'd be lying if I said he didn't flesh them out very, very, very, well.\r\n\r\nJonathan Demme also won an Oscar for his directing and he does a very good job of it.\r\n\r\n_The Silence of the Lambs_ is relentlessly thrilling and it holds me to my seat until the last frame every time I see it, all without relying on excessive gore.\r\nI've already mentioned that _The Silence of the Lambs_ doesn't scare me, so it may - or may not - scare you, depending on what you're afraid of. Admittedly, there are a few creepy things displayed onscreen so I can see why it would scare some viewers.\r\nEither way, I can't recommend _The Silence of the Lambs_ enough, and everybody should see it at least once.\r\n\r\n_The Silence of the Lambs_ is a childhood favorite of mine, and it holds up very, very well almost 25 years after its release. It's relentlessly thrilling, flawlessly acted, flawlessly written, flawlessly directed, and one of the few movies that actually deserved all the Oscars it won.", "This is one of a few movies I put off reviewing for years, because I honestly don't know what to say about a film this classic. So I'll be brief in my actual review, knowing that it comes from a place where I honestly believe that this is a movie that deserves its praise:\r\n\r\nEven if the A-plot of the story wasn't one of the best crime thrillers put to screen, the Hannibal Lector moments alone would be enough to make _Silence of the Lambs_ a great movie, most especially his run in Memphis.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._", "It kind of reminds me of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, because Frank and Jame are drag queens who kill.", "As a genre fan, there's a certain amount of satisfaction when a film is recognized by mainstream audiences. That's what it was like for me in 1992 when <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> swept the Oscar's (Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress). \r\n\r\nAnd boy did the movie deserve it. Jonathan Demme's fantastic retelling of the classic book by Thomas Harris. Anthony Hopkins' scene-chewing Hannibal Lecter turned him into a pop culture icon (and unfortunately a slew of middling sequels). And Jodie Foster's grim and naive portrayal of Clarice. \r\n\r\nThe final touch is that haunting score. Some of the best movies out there are elevated by a musical score that puts it another league. \r\n\r\nA phenomenal classic.", "**Absolute Classic Film!\r\n I read the book before watching this thriller/horror classic film by Jonathan Demme. The film works on so many levels and at times feels very realistic in how it portraits law enforcers and the perverse criminals they pursue. Outstanding performances by Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster, Scott Glen, Ted Levine, etc.. I feel the director was influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho classic horror film by way of how grounded this film shows the deadly cat and mouse game and the overall arch of themes throughout.\r\n Fear and desire for sex, loathing of the human body, suppression of emotions, hatred for banality and towards women, etc. In this day of cartoon Marvel movies which have little or no connections to human experiences or reality, this classic film will stand the test of time because of how all of the creative artists involve respected the work. This one's on my all time top favorite list of must see films.", "This is a brilliant screen adaptation of the Thomas Harris book with a cast impossible to improve upon. Anthony Hopkins plays \"Hannibal Lecter\", a murderous sophisticate with a penchant for eating the evidence and Jodie Foster as the novice FBI agent sent to try and elicit his help in tracking down a killer with a similar modus operandi to our now incarcerated \"Lecter\". The menace with which Hopkins portrays the role is spine-chilling. Foster conveys the transformation from scared young agent to hard-nosed detective with convincing aplomb and this really does make for a belter of a thriller. A clean sweep of 5 Oscars and the top 2 acting BAFTA awards can't be wrong!"], ["A vain Queen visits her mirror each day to have it confirmed that she is the fairest in the land.

Luckily, she stumbles upon the cottage of the seven dwarves - who depart each day to mine for jewels. They return home, discover her asleep in one of their tiny beds and after a bit of a bumpy start, take her to their hearts. That's basically the theme - the film has \"heart\"; the dwarves reflect seven differing facets of human personality but all are sensitively enveloped in a glue of loyalty and humanity. All of these are tested as the wicked Queen discovers that the girl is still thriving (via her mirror) and sets out, personally, do the job. This Brothers' Grimm story is the stuff of all of our childhoods, as is the ending to this ultimately romantic fairy tale. The animations are beautifully crafted; the dialogue of menace and humour is marvellously engaging and - at times - poignant, too. There are plenty of memorable, catchy songs into the bargain. I always preferred \"Bashful\" myself.."], ["Great watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nIt is very sad that this happened to people, but the way the story is told is so good that I felt like that sadness melted away fairly quickly.\r\n\r\nThis movie holds up after 25 years, and it is dated, but with cellphones the story would change dramatically, and that would be a good alternative history subject for a different movie.\r\n\r\nA great cast, excellent deliveries, an amazing story, and the cinematography is a favorite on this one.  The setting of a snowy Minnesota really allows for some great isolation scenes and highlights the \"coldness\" of the motivations in the story.\r\n\r\nI think they even summarize the events at one point as \"all over a little money\", and it's spot on.\r\n\r\nI can't say that any one thing is spectacular, but everything is done so well, I honestly think this is a great example of how to shoot a movie.", "I didn't enjoy is as much as I thought I would, but <em>'Fargo'</em> is still very good and something I'd obviously recommend.\r\n\r\nI like the cast here, even if it is a bit of a Frances McDormand carryjob to be honest - she is terrific all the way through, absolutely nailing the role. Steve Buscemi is the star away from McDormand, while I've seen a few glimpses of William H. Macy elsewhere but this is his best showing that I've watched thus far. Peter Stormare is good too.\r\n\r\nIt's an entertaining story, that's for certain! Around 98 minutes was a wise run time call, also. I didn't get that extra little something from it, yet it's a film that I'd more than happily rewatch - largely thanks to McDormand, and Buscemi.", "**An excellent film, although the comedy is so watered down and so sarcastic that it's not funny to most people.**\r\n\r\nWhen I saw this movie for the first time, a few years ago, I didn't understand it, and it annoyed me a lot. However, I've always heard good things about it, and after seeing several Cohen films that I liked, I realized the film's potential and decided to rewatch it. I did it at a good time: the film is better than I thought, and I just didn't know how to evaluate it as it deserved.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with a note indicating that it is based on real events. It's a joke, actually, as it's entirely fictional. The story, however, can be based on several crimes, because it's nothing that we haven't seen on some TV news: a man who desperately needs money decides to hire two criminals and fake the kidnapping of his own wife, in order to convince his wealthy father-in-law to pay a fat ransom. It turns out that, as is so often the case in Cohen Brothers movies, things don't go as planned, the criminal duo's control gets out of hand and people start to die, as the local authorities, which practically boil down to a pregnant sheriff and a few colleagues, try to investigate what is going on.\r\n\r\nThe film made a huge sensation among critics and at festivals. It was nominated for several Oscars, but only won two statuettes (Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress). It was also considered by many to be the best film by the Cohen Brothers, a highly relative consideration, which largely depends on the personal taste of the person who claims it. Anyway, it's a good movie, quite tense and dramatic, and where the comedy is in the brutally ironic way in which things happen.\r\n\r\nFrances McDormand is an actress who deserves particular attention in this film. She's not the kind of law enforcement officer we'd expect to see, because she appears to have a friendliness and sweetness that goes hand in hand with uncompromising law enforcement or even the use of firearms. However, her character does that and is actually very good at following her lead. Another actor to be congratulated is Steve Buscemi. He gives a huge performance, perhaps one of the best of his career so far. Next to him, Peter Stormare gives us the image of a cold and few-spoken criminal, who exerts brutal violence when he gets angry. William Macy is convincing in the role of the car salesman, with a slimy overdose of hypocritical politeness and cowardice.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has excellent cinematography, where snow and gray tones are the dominant accent. Interestingly, it seems that a lot of artificial snow was used in the film in order to achieve the icy and inhospitable look that the directors wanted. The sets and costumes are very good, particularly McDormand's costume and her hairstyle. The film uses a lot of very good visual and special effects, particularly in the more violent scenes, like the one where the killer tries to tear his victim apart in a shredder. The soundtrack has one of the most interesting main themes in the Cohens' filmography.", "Saw this again recently for it's anniversary, or 4k conversion, - who cares what the reason was, it was just great to see it up on the bg screen again. In my view, it's easily the best of efforts from both the Coen brothers and from the formidable Frances McDormand. Here, she is a pregnant local cop who must deal with a sudden spate of crimes in her magnificently named town \"Brainerd\". William H. Macy (\"Jerry\") and the usually under-rated Steve Buscemi (\"Carl\") add loads to value to this drama that offers an almost perfect mix of sharp and wittily written dialogue, some clever and poignant performances and a storyline that does border on the surreal at times, but then again we are in Minnesota so is it all that surreal at all? The deliberately staccato nature of the dialogue cannot help raise a smile and a cringe - but that is how it is meant to come across. It takes skill to act like these folks do here, dumbing up and dumbing down to order whilst keeping an eye to a vaguely serious series of underlying plot lines... You won't like all of the characters, indeed some people get their well deserved comeuppance but this is still one of the best films from the 1990s and well worth a watch on a big screen if you can."], ["I know this has an incredible fan base and considered a cult classic but as someone who never watched this I don't have any nostalgia feelings for this. I found some of the animation to be pretty good while others, like for the segment, \"Harry Canyon\", I didn't care very much for (although it was my favorite one of the bunch, reminded me of The Fifth Element). The rest was watchable but not terribly impressive and the last, \"Taarna\" had good visuals but at that point I really was not invested.\r\n\r\nI don't know, maybe if I had watched this at some point in the late 80s or early 90s, it would have a better connection with my, but I was more interested as it is, not sure I have much interest in revisiting. **3.0/5**"], ["When a wealthy Parisian lady summons her lawyer to amend her will, her faithful butler \"Edgar\" assumes it will all be his.

The style of the animation used for this story reminded me a lot of \"101 Dalmatians\" (1961) with some similarly engaging characterisations. It's at it's best in ensemble mode - the \"Ev'rybody Wants to be a Cat\" number getting the toes tapping and the denouement with the cats, an horse, a large trunk and a trip to Timbuktu for the loser a fine finale for all (except, perhaps, their next door neighbours).

What the film did was, essentially, a movie episode. The differences are minimal, and that seems a bit lazy to me right off the bat. There are lots of films based on good TV series, and it's not uncommon for the opposite to happen, but generally there is an effort, on the part of those who make the films, to give us something different, even if the base is there. That didn't happen here.\r\n\r\nAlso, the film tries to make witty jokes based on the older film, but it splatters roundly on the floor with each one. First, because there is a bad placement of the jokes, which happens before we even realize why, as if it were a spoiler. And then, because they are dull jokes, a type of humor that seems like it would only have a chance to work at the expense of a few very alcoholic drinks. I just don't like humor like that, and therefore the movie didn't have any jokes. Luckily, it was a fairly brief movie, just over an hour, or I would have stopped and moved on to something really more interesting."], ["I don't think it's anything absolutely bad, but <em>'Operation Dumbo Drop'</em> is pretty lacklustre and a bit slow to sit through.\r\n\r\nI do like the cast. Danny Glover (Cahill) and Ray Liotta (Doyle) are solid together, while Denis Leary (Poole) and Doug E. Doug (Ashford) may not give anything memorable but both are alright; as is Dinh Thien Le (Linh). Also interesting to see Raymond Cruz appear, in his early years pre-Tuco.\r\n\r\nIt seems the trio of Glover, Liotta and Leary really don't rate this, given the latter's comments in later years about it; though it sounds like that's more to do with the filming process, rather than the end product.\r\n\r\nI more than likely wont be revisiting this any time soon, but I don't hate it or anything."], ["Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis movie has held up over a long period of time due to stellar performances by Janeane Garofalo and Uma Thurman, and that's really all it has going for it.  Great actors giving solid delivery in a decent script.\r\n\r\nIt does remind me of Cyrano de Bergerac a bit, but it's a classic switcheroo trope for a romantic comedy that gives a life lesson of beauty is what you make of it.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem is that they basically call Garofalo ugly because she's not Thurman, which doesn't make sense to me.\r\n\r\nOther that that, the script is strong enough without being spectacular, and I feel like the cast had to work very hard to make the movie what it is.\r\n\r\nA modern day reboot is surely on the way with it being about a podcast of the same name."], [], [], [], [], ["I'm not sure \"Flora\" (Kate Beckinsale) really knew what to expect when she arrived at the home of her more rustic family at the eponymous location. Farmhouses always look so welcoming and inviting, but one step through the door here and she might as well have stepped back through time. With a cast of characters named as if they were inspired by Charles Dickens, John Schlesinger takes us on a darkly humorous trip through the lives (and loves) of this community. \"Can someone wash my curtains?\" she enquires... \"I think they're red but I'd like to be sure\". She's got a meagre \u00a3100 per year, but that's a fortune for many who live a life trading hens and chickens and getting up to all sorts in the hay loft. Of course, there's loads of romantic shenanigans going on too as her wealthy cousin \"Charles\" (Christopher Bowen) takes an unrequited shine to her whilst she prefers life with her guilt-stricken relative \"Starkadder\" (Eileen Atkins) whilst all are under the thumb of the reclusive \"Aunt Ada\" (the scene stealing Sheila Burrell). This is a society where nothing is as is seems or straightforward and any novel that \"Flora\" might choose to write in later life is going to be a colourful affair! The story is whimsically engaging enough but it's really the assemblage of talent here that makes this work. Freddie Jones, the cheekily expressive Miriam Margolyes, Stephen Fry, Sir Ian McKellen and Joanna Lumley (never a very versatile actress, I find) all chip into this tale of the startling hypocrisy existing between the vulgar and crass and the prim and the proper. It looks good, flows well and shows what can be done when everyone is on board for a bit of a muddy romp."], [], ["**_Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt chasing tornadoes on the prairie_**\r\n\r\nWhen atmospheric conditions are conducive to tornadoes, a weatherman (Paxton) tracks down his separated wife (Hunt) and inadvertently joins their storm-chasing team in the Midwest because he can\u2019t resist seeing his sensor invention finally put to use. Jami Gertz plays his new love, Cary Elwes a pompous rival and Philip Seymour Hoffman a wild team member.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwister\u201d (1996) could be categorized as a disaster flick, but with the distinction that the protagonists are constantly chasing the potential disaster. The entire film takes place in the prairies or forests of the Midwest with ominous skies and intermittent destructive tornadoes. It\u2019s called \u201cTwister\u201d and that\u2019s what you get.\r\n\r\nThe writers keep things interesting by adding human interest with the, admittedly contrived, love triangle and the rival storm-chasing team that has corporate sponsors (the horror, the horror). I didn\u2019t mind the love story. When two people belong together, they belong together. Perhaps the fianc\u00e9 will realize this.

Here with The Cable Guy, I myself salute the internet highway and in particular the many users of IMDb who have come forth to support this most divisive of movies. Lambasted on release by regarded critics and chided by many a cinema goer who went in expecting Mask & Ace Ventura like fluff, The Cable Guy was thought to be the death knell for Carrey's career. It wasn't of course. He would revert to pleasing box office friendly type the following year with \"Liar Liar\", and would continue to surprise with his choice of roles, and the performances with them, in the likes of \"The Truman Show\", \"Man On The Moon\" & \"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\". As a point of reference with his career overview, The Cable Guy stands up as a bold choice by Carrey, and one that serves notice of his willingness, and ability, to take on more challenging roles.\r\n\r\nThe film itself is a mixture of high Carrey comedy mixed with dark, almost horror undertones. The thematics of loneliness and the need for companionship makes for an odd bedfellow with the berserker antics of Carrey as he plays off of Matthew Broderick's ordinary Joe. Yet director Ben Stiller, the cop out finale aside, has achieved the cheeky fusion with much success. Utilising Carrey's energy as both a force of comic nature, and a bubbling under the surface desperado loony tune. Along the way, well before it goes real dark and gets edgy, we are treated to some delightful comedy moments. A Karaoke sequence and dinner at Medieval Times stand out, but the knowing jokes referencing movies and the TV infatuated world are also unheralded, and astute stabs of fun. Far from perfect it be, but it's a film that was badly timed, or even, misunderstood by the scribes of the time. Thank the lord for the internet for we can now find those prepared to admit they like much about The Cable Guy. Yes, I be one of those hardy souls too. 7/10"], ["When a man's jawbone drops off it's time to reassess the situation.\r\n\r\nPeter Jackson's The Frighteners is an odd blend of outright comedy and supernatural thriller, if able to get onside with that then there's a whole lot to enjoy. Plot essential has Michael J. Fox as a psychic who really can see dead people, so much so in fact that he has befriended three ghosts and makes a living out of setting up hauntings and charging people to exorcise the spirits. However, things turn decidedly deadly when he encounters a grim reaper like spirit that is killing people and putting a number on their foreheads. It seems there is a serial killing spirit on the loose.\r\n\r\nFrank Bannister (Fox) is grieving from the death of his wife and he has become a conman, this is an interesting characterisation for Fox to play and he does so with relish. Initially the pic is all about the comedy, with Bannister's interactions with the three ghosts devilishly funny. Ok, the effects work now look a bit crude, but there's a vibrancy on offer both visually and orally.\r\n\r\nCome the second third the pic shifts into a serial killer investigation and the narrative gets dark. Oh there's still fun in the mix, but Jackson and his team are toying with the very real facet of a celebrity serial killer (ebulliently played by Jake Busey). Trini Alvarado (what happened to her?) is playing what ends up as Bannister's side-kick and love interest and the pair of them are thrust into a frantic final third of a life and death battle with Busey's psychotic spirit Johnny Bartlett. Bartlett in turn is aided by mentally ill Patricia Bradley (horror icon Dee Wallace Stone), while an outrageously over the top Jeffrey Combs is in the mix as a damaged FBI agent intent on destroying bannister and all he stands for.\r\n\r\nWhen you strip it down it's a live action horror comedy cartoon, which when you look in context to Jackson's early work is not surprising. It's also not surprising that The Frighteners has become a cult movie of some standing. The bonkers plot, the close to the knuckle humour and choice narrative threads make it a fascinating viewing experience. 7.5/10", "Has maybe not aged flawlessly, but it's very silly and very involved in a good kind of way. Kind of feels like a spoof but I'm honestly not sure what of, so I think that it's maybe just a light toned take on some pretty dark subject matter. It's been about 20 years since I last watched The Frighteners and I think I could probably go about that long before I watch it again, but I still do think it's worthwhile. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"], ["**Texas yesterday and today: a film where the past serves to weave considerations for the present.**\r\n\r\nFor us, the Portuguese, who see the USA from the outside, it is difficult to comprehend the internal differences between the US states. For us, USA is a country of continental dimensions, which conveys a united and uniform image. And this image could not be more misleading: the US remains a union of fifty small miniature countries, which have their own governments, authorities and laws, which do not necessarily apply everywhere. And as history teaches us, the case of Texas is even more extravagant: Texas is a country that acquired its independence from Mexico, and only after that, by its own will, join the USA (before trying to leave again, with the other states of the Confederation). So it's a country in its own right, just like California and Hawaii, an independent kingdom until it was invaded by the US.\r\n\r\nI'm saying all of this because this film, despite having nothing to do with these, does rambling on these topics and on the past of Texans, and the difficult relationship between Anglo-Saxon and Hispanic ethnicities. Despite the predominance of the Anglo-Saxon in the authorities and government, the film makes it clear that Texas is a land that rightfully belongs to the Hispanic ethnic group, the so-called \u201cTejanos\u201d. It's their land, the Anglo-Saxons came later. And yet, the \u201cTejanos\u201d are humiliated, acculturated, discriminated, and we see the violence of such practices in the relationships between the characters and in the brutal attitude of Sheriff Wade. The script weaves these considerations around a skeleton that is found by chance and that reveals an unsolved crime that may be connected to the late sheriff Buddy Deeds, a character very dear to the city. In charge of the investigation, his son and current sheriff doesn't have the same sympathy for his father and is determined to uncover his father's supposed dark side. There are still some less well-crafted sub-plots here: the insipid romance between the sheriff and the teacher, the corruption and political convenience behind the construction of an unnecessary prison, the bad relationship between a strict black military commander and his father, who owns a bar...\r\n\r\nThe cast includes several well-known names. Chris Cooper is a solid protagonist, who does a very good job. He's not an actor that I know very well, I confess that I've only seen him play relatively minor roles, but I was pleased to see him play a role like that. Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a doesn't disappoint us either, and does a satisfying job with her character, although the subplot that involves her may sound a little far-fetched. Kris Kristofferson also does a very good job, turning the law enforcement officer into an authentic mobster, full of prejudice, brutality and arrogance. Stephen Mendillo, Clifton James and Mirian Colon also give us brief appearances and a job well done.\r\n\r\nJohn Sayles is a director I didn't know about until I saw this film. From what I saw here, I liked his work: the director doesn't offer us a pearl of cinema, but he gives us quality entertainment, associated with punctual and accurate political and social stings. The film has good cinematography, it even looks younger than it is, and the camera work is really good, especially in the flashbacks. Light and shadow are well used and the soundtrack, despite not surprising us, does its job."], ["**A good film, spoiled by a horrible ending.**\r\n\r\nWhen I decided to watch this film, I was quite curious about its story. In fact, the film has its interest and works almost until the end. It is precisely the ending that ruins the efforts made so far. It's not the first time, and it certainly won't be the last, that I've come across a film that would have had everything to work if the screenwriter and director had had the ability to end the story as happily as they started it.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film doesn't present anything special. Cinematography, visual and sound effects, sets, costumes, filming locations, soundtrack... it's all reasonably well executed, but it doesn't present any surprises or quality notes worth mentioning. It's just another bland, meek and nothing special film. As for the cast, it is up to us to recognize everyone's collective effort and the good performance of most of the groups. John Travolta, who is an actor that I don't like very much, manages to give us a very friendly and committed performance, creating an appealing character, who easily captures our empathy and who has the necessary charisma to stand out and captivate the audience. Alongside him are two excellent actors, Robert Duvall and Forest Whitaker. Both stand out for their sympathy and manage to give us two secondary characters strong enough to give the film additional interest. Kyra Sedgwick is worse off, as she doesn't seem to have any value to the film other than being a love interest.\r\n\r\nThe script has excellent premises that, although not really original, manage to have the interest they need to support the film: a completely ordinary man who lives in rural America becomes a genius after suffering an inexplicable incident on the night of his birthday with a light coming from the sky. In addition to an extraordinary ability to think and reason that allows him to solve problems quickly, he begins to read uncontrollably, learn everything and improve things around him, in an absolutely visionary way. Everything indicates that he suffered some type of incident with aliens, and this hypothesis is used for a lot of discussion in the film. When we are approaching the end, the script completely derails and gives us the most anticlimactic ending we could imagine, which not only disrespects everything that has been done but does not explain even half of what happened to that man. Worse than this, just a hard kick to our heads."], [], ["The Godfather Review by Al Carlson\r\n\r\nThe Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.\r\nThe Godfather revolves around the Corleone\u2019s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone\u2019s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn\u2019t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo\u2019s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo\u2019s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.\r\nThe characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don\u2019s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It\u2019s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.\r\nDirecter Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola\u2019s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. \r\nThis film should be immediately followed up by it\u2019s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They\u2019re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won\u2019t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven\u2019t seen this movie yet, it\u2019s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can\u2019t refuse.", "The best movie ever...\r\nA masterpiece by the young and talented Francis Ford Coppola, about a Mob family and their drama, the story telling is perfect, the acting good, sometimes a little over the top in the case of Thalia Shire (the sister of the director)\r\n\r\nThe 70's were the best years for Hollywood.", "While I'm writing this, The Godfather is still beloved by people who love it simply because they are told they have to love it. \r\nIt's written by a mobster with the sole intention of depicting the lead mobsters as demi gods. Every line and every scene in the movie and the book is meant to intimidate people into thinking the \"Mafia\" and really any mob, is a supernatural force.\r\nThis is a movie glorifying control freaks, and most critics are control freaks, and most critics are either in the mob or think they can join the mob.\r\nThe movie itself is dull and totally uninspiring, not to mention totally uninspired. For fifty years, the sheep have been cowing to the control freaks who tell them to love this movie that degrades them. \r\nThere just isn't anything favorable about this movie. It owes its success to people who have interests in the movie or think they can get brownie points with such people. It's totally Hollywood in its depressing nature, and even in the seventies it was a formula film.", "When you get a story written quite this magnificently it would take an extreme amateur to screw it up - and Francis Ford Coppola is no amateur. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall represent the epitome of guile, sophistication, loyalty, honour and brutality in this self-adapted Mario Puzo story of the unambiguously ambitious \"Corleone\" family - they start with nothing and so the only way is up; however and whatever they need to do to get there. The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she's getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother \"Fredo\" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film's place as amongst the best ever made. My only criticism, and it is slight at that, is that the audio mix could have done with a bit of a boost. Much of the dialogue - especially from Brando - verges on the inaudible at times.", "Great Movie **Ever**"], [], ["Easily the best film the Wachowskis have ever done. I heartily wish that they had stayed low-key, under the radar, and made great scorching films like this one.", "**A competent and well-made erotic thriller, but without great originality.**\r\n\r\nThis movie was a pleasant surprise. It came out in 1996, when dramatic films with a strong erotic content were still in vogue. Perhaps it is one of the last to have known some success, in fact. Understandably, the film remained very much alive in the heydays of VHS, I think it made its way to DVD, but gradually fell into oblivion where it currently rests. Is it deserved? Maybe not, but it's understandable to a certain extent: it's not an excellent film, but it will be a good bet for anyone who likes erotic thrillers.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is based on the lesbian case of two women, who become involved and decide to run away with a large fortune in mafia money, incriminating the mafia boyfriend of one of them. This is a script devoid of any kind of originality and that can only surprise for the lesbian content and the high dose of nudity, because all the violence, the profanity, the strong dialogues, the fast scenes, all of these are elements that we all expected. in a film of this type.\r\n\r\nThe work of the directors is excellent and opened the doors to the \u201cMatrix\u201d franchise, with which they would come to consecrate themselves before falling back into obscurity from which they rarely manage to rise. They managed to insert many nuances of film noir into a strongly erotic plot, including the aesthetics and lighting of several scenes, and the sets, costumes, cinematography and soundtrack are truly good.\r\n\r\nThe two leading actresses are Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly. None of them are great actresses, each of them has had their moments of brilliance in films where they have minor roles, and I don't think they will ever go beyond that. So, what they do here is interesting because they both showed commitment and gave a lot to the project. It doesn't mean they are extraordinarily talented or great actresses. The fact is that they got a good partnership on stage, they have a strong and credible chemistry, and the film builds on top of that effectively. As an actor, Joe Pantoliano is better and gives us the best interpretation of the film, and it's worth seeing the actor working with them.", "<em>'Bound'</em> is a fun one!\r\n\r\nI've always wanted to get this watched since growing up with (the great) Jennifer Tilly via the <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/childs-play-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chucky</a>'</em> franchise and having heard this mentioned on/off down the years, so I'm glad that I have belatedly done so. It's entertaining! I knew of the love stuff and it sure does deliver, though I am surprised it only really happens at the beginning... it makes sense, I just assumed it was gonna be recurring throughout.\r\n\r\nTilly and Gina Gershon are excellent together, very strong onscreen chemistry! Like with what I previously mentioned, I was also slightly surprised that Gershon disappears for what felt like a decent chunk of the movie; despite being literally next door.

The rest of the cast is solid, especially the cat.\r\n\r\nThe plot seems rather daring for the time, though they are careful about talking around mature themes. I thought Mickey Rooney playing a Japanese character was in terrible taste, and apparently director Blake Edwards wished he could cast it over again. It wasn\u2019t Rooney\u2019s fault; it was a thankless role and comes across as racist with our modern sensibilities.\r\n\r\nSo I wasn\u2019t dazzled by the story, but I found the final scene with the cat redeemed some of the flaws I noticed along the way.", "Audrey Hepburn is at the top of her game as the dysfunctional socialite \"Holly\" who takes a bit of a shine to the rather staid \"Paul\" (George Peppard) who has moved into their apartment building. He is an artist in what can only be described a rut, and is readily, if a little timidly, subsumed into her wacky and lively world. She claims he reminds her of her brother, but of course time and events soon change that dynamic. Thing is, though, they both have some pretty hefty skeletons in their closets, and the challenge for them both will be to not let those spoil what could be a burgeoning romance! Aside from the legendary \"Moon River\" song, this is essentially just a quickly paced character study of two people with about as many complexities to their personalities as it is possible to have. The dialogue is often genuinely funny; the scenarios - though sometimes a little cringe-making - can't help but raise a smile as does the continuity provided by their constantly complaining upstairs neighbour. Time has not been especially kind to some of the stereotypes - not least Mickey Rooney's \"Yunioshi\" but taken in the context of the time, it is still entertaining, risqu\u00e9 even, and enjoyable to watch."], ["Timeless classic still entertaining the masses as each new generation comes in.\r\n\r\nDorothy is a young girl living on a Kansas farm, during a tornado, she, along with her dog Toto, is swept up and plonked down in a magical and mysterious land known as Oz. Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch, she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way, she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard. It's a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard Of Oz is a film that has been pored over and dissected from almost everyone involved in the wonderful world of film. One thing that strikes me every time I view it is that there not only is no place like home, there is also no film like The Wizard Of Oz, and really, when all is said and done, there is unlikely to be another film of its ilk to ever grace the silver screen. Upon multiple viewings only the most biased of film fan could say that it is a technically perfect picture, it clearly isn't, for at times it's a wee bit creaky and when scrutinised, some of the performances in the piece are far from being of an excellent standard. Crucially, though, any misgivings are quickly erased due to the utter wonder of it all, you see this is because the film has a beguiling ability to transport everybody who is watching it and slot them into OZ alongside Dorothy.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard Of Oz appeals (and caters) to every demographic and pretty much any age group, we have adventure, the meeting of new friends, fears and trepidations, booming colour, songs to singalong with, and of course the total crux point of homely values. The Wizard Of Oz stands up well 80 years later because it taps into all the emotions available to the human being. Be it a young child spellbound on a first viewing, or an octogenarian couple of grandparents wistfully humming along to the tunes, it's a film that shouldn't be dissected looking for faults and hidden meanings, it's a film that should be loved and praised for the ode to fantastical whimsy that it so obviously is.\r\n\r\nThe film of course will forever be associated with its darling star, Judy Garland. Viewing now, and knowing what a sad life she would eventually lead, The Wizard Of Oz is a fitting picture on which to remember what a magical and wonderful performer she was. Myself as a lump of waning middle aged machismo, has no shame in saying that as Judy sings Somewhere Over The Rainbow I melt and feel as though I'm being sent spinning into another world, that's the power of the piece, because as a sepia Kansas becomes the glorious colour of Oz, nothing else in my world matters, I'm in hook line and sinker.\r\n\r\nThere are many interesting back stories to the picture, with books galore available to anyone interested. Some notes that might interest you being the original castings to be W.C. Fields, Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, munchkins running riot, drunken cast members, sadness and suicides, and grizzled old pros fighting hard not to let Garland steal the picture. Well it makes for a great read, for sure, but what remains to this day is one of the most beloved pictures to have ever been made, for once in the pantheon of great cinema we have a film that is termed a classic, that actually deserves to have that tag!\r\n\r\nOne of the great things about the advent of technology is that it can benefit old classic movies to make them better, for now we can view remastered editions of The Wizard Of Oz and appreciate even more what a great job the makers did. Keep your eyes on Dorothy's Ruby Slippers during the film and see how they are the sparkling important character that they should be, or take in the brilliant work of the make up crew, the tiniest of rivets on The Tin Man a testament to the brilliant work that goes into bringing magic to our lives.

And let us not forget the legendary Margaret Hamilton, as both Miss Gulch and The Wicked Witch of the West. These, in addition to a second to none list of supporting players, make for one exceptionally performed ensemble. Outstanding creativity. Exquisite direction.\r\n\r\nIt was not my wish, as I composed this review, to go into detail (not even minorly) concerning the plot here, because, as I'd indicated earlier, many a generational has already witnessed this filmed phenomenon. And for me to have rehashed a summary of its plot would have been simply redundant.\r\n\r\nDirected by Academy Award-winner Victor Fleming (Gone with the Wind), The Wizard of Oz will always have the authority to command my love, my admiration, my awe, and my fascination. Always.\r\n\r\nFive out of five well-earned stars.", "5 stars \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\r\n\r\nMy personal favorite non-Disney produced film of all time as well as my personal idol for \u201cmelt\u201d movies.", "I was really fortunate, recently, to catch this on a big screen and it is still wonderful. After her dog is taken by \"Miss Gulch\" (Margaret Hamilton), \"Dorothy\" (Judy Garland) is all in a tizz. She decides to run away from her kindly aunt and uncle but only gets about a mile down the road before she encounters a medicine show run by \"Prof. Marvel\" (Frank Morgan). A twister is approaching - she must get home before she is blown away. She makes it into her room but is clouted by a blown-in window and next thing, the house is flying through the air and she lands in Oz and on top of the \"Witch of the East\" - exposing only her ruby slippers. \"Munchkinland\" proves to be a friendly enough place, but the good witch \"Glinda\" (Billie Burke) tells her that she must seek the help of the great and powerful Oz should she wish to get home. Now in possession of the dead witch's slippers, she sets off down the legendary \"Yellow Brick Road\" along which she encounters the scarecrow, the tin man and the frequently scene stealing cowardly lion (Bert Lahr) as they set off on their adventures - constantly harassed by the evil \"Witch of the West\" (Hamilton) who has designs on the shoes! The story evolves in the best traditions of a classic fairytale. Good vs. evil, humour, friendship, a good degree of pantomime menace, a can of WD40 and some small people with squeaky voices all contributing magnificently to the overall cinema experience. The colours of 'Oz\" are vivid and joyous - contrasting well with the drab, downbeat monochrome Kansas from whence \"Dorothy\" has come and to where she hopes to boldly go again! The cast is small and tightly knitted, allowing the relationships and momentum to build up stealthily from Frank Baum's original story to probably the finest denouement of any fantasy film made since. Miss Hamilton's characterisation (I always love a good baddie) reminded me of my English teacher at school - only this one wore less make up; and Bert Lahr and Jack Haley never fail to raise a smile - or even a tear - as they follow their own yellow brick roads. Yip Harburg and Harold Arlen have worked their magic with a score and songs that compliment the adventure splendidly - I wonder how many singers have had a go a \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" since 1939? Despite being over eighty years old, it has lost little of it's magic. The visual effects rely on simplicity and vivacity, and they deliver well a thoroughly engaging story of longing, companionship and the most fiendish laugh in cinema history. Watch it, my pretty... or else!", "**_Highly entertaining, but also... enlightening_**\r\n\r\nA tornado rips through Dorothy's home in Kansas and transports her to the land of Oz where she meets a scarecrow in need of a brain, a tin man in need of a heart and a lion in need of courage. So they venture to the Emerald City in search of the eponymous wizard. \r\n\r\n\"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) is eminently entertaining for both kids and adults. The message is great to boot. Yes, it's about developing your head, heart, and courage to find your way \"home,\" but its most potent moral is about pulling back the curtain on political authorities and religion to expose the feeble phony pulling the levers.\r\n\r\nWhich isn't to say that all such authorities are phonies, of course, just that we need to be ever conscious of the fakes trying to manipulate us by pulling our strings.\r\n\r\nThe creators were smart to actually make the wicked witch of the west, her castle and flying monkeys creepy and horrific (in a comic booky way). \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A+"], ["I cannot fully explain all aspects of the movie easily and clearly in a text smaller than a large volume, but yet I will try to compress it decently here.\r\nFirst and foremost, the movie for me is like a spectacle which could go on with the same cast for 100 hours and still be interesting and captivating. I have always wished it had been a series with this cast instead of a movie. Futile wishes!\r\n\r\nThe casting, to begin with, is very well matched to the book's spirit if not the physical descriptions. Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland and Hattie McDaniel. I stop here and will edit it bit by bit to complete it in a few days. It is too large to finish in one writing."], ["\"The Greatest Movie of All Time!\" That's the general opinion of this movie, and I agree that it is a great movie, but I have seen better movies. \r\n\r\nThe story of Citizen Kane is simple, a newspaper tycoon named Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies, and his last word is \"Rosebud\". No one knows what it means, and a reporter starts interviewing people Kane knew, to see if they know the meaning of \"Rosebud\". Through flash-backs we get to see Kane's life.\r\n\r\nNow, as I said, I don't agree that it's the greatest movie of all time, however it's great. I love this movie. It's a daring and controversial movie of its time, and it introduced alot of new technices in filmmaking. The acting is superb! Orson Welles as Kane is breathtaking, Joseph Cotten as Jed Leland is great. There's one performance I can hardly stand though and that's Dorothy Comingore's performance as Susan Alexander. Hideous performance to say the least! The writing is amazing, and Welles' directing is out-of-this-world!\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, great movie (however not the greatest ever made). It's definitly a movie you need to watch!\r\n\r\nI give it a 9/10", "I fondly recollect, growing up in Canada in the 70's and 80's, my mom taking my older sister and I to the cinema (my dad was more interested in watching bowling, hockey, or either crime shows, British sitcoms or hockey on TV). Despite all of his TV appearances over the years, and films he acted in to fund his own productions, the first time I was aware of Orson Welles was one of those startling and bizarrely professional yet unmistakably charismatic 'Paul Masson' wine commercials that they tend to make fun of on The Simpsons in these decades gone by. My first thought was 'that voice is amazing', then 'he looks like he'd be a fine grandfather or Santa Claus', and I instantly wanted to know who he was: Just the way he carried himself, I knew he must be both brilliant and someone who was really important.\r\n\r\nAs you can tell, I'm not going to unnecessarily repeat all the endless accolades this film has gotten over the years. If you're any type of film lover, you have either seen this or will eventually--unless you're hit by a bus tomorrow (Heaven forbid) or something else drastic. It's a hallmark of what is possible in cinema. I waited until I was 46 to see this, because of its stellar reputation. It's not my favourite Welles--either acting or directing, and not by a long shot in either regard--but I'm very glad that I finally saw it, and I'll probably revisit it every couple of years for the rest of my life. There's just something really special about it that's hardly ever seen any more--and I think of that just as wistfully as Charles Foster Kane did about his beloved 'Rosebud'. That a 25-year-old could be so gleefully and breathtakingly experimental and innovative, yet still endlessly entertain, is nothing short of miraculous.", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nThe \"greatest film of all-time\", everyone declares. I've been revisiting David Fincher's career this last week since he's in charge of directing the upcoming Mank, which premise approaches the story behind Citizen Kane's screenplay credit controversy back in 1941. Herman J. Mankiewicz unquestionably helped Orson Welles writing the script for this movie, but if that contribution was enough to warrant his name on the film's credits, well... Apparently, it was settled that Mankiewicz (known as Mank) did indeed deserve that recognition since I just had to write his name on the \"written by\" section above. Nevertheless, this review doesn't concern that external issue, but yes, the most globally acclaimed movie in cinema's history.\r\n\r\nI always defend that someone's opinion about a film is as valid as everyone else's. Unless the arguments used are disrespectful, reductive comments such as the cliche \"it's just boring\" or the externally influenced \"I don't like that actor in real life, hence the movie is awful\", I'm always ready to discuss a film with anyone who shows respect for the respective flick. There's an interesting question people keep asking me: \"should I watch this old movie that everyone talks about? It's just that...\" and usually they linger around here. Probably, afraid of saying something like \"it's still in black-and-white\" or \"its visuals are so old-fashioned\". This is a pretty common behavior in the entertainment realm that is film watching.\r\n\r\nI always reply back with another question: \"if you love movies, why wouldn't you want to watch such a highly acclaimed film, no matter how old it is?\" And, again, people hesitate because they've never asked themselves this. They're afraid that their \"discrimination\" against old movies might affect their overall opinion about them, and then be in that complicated position that is being in a very small minority. If there's something time didn't change is that people still don't know how to behave when they're part of a little group with an unpopular opinion. Some follow the offense route, attacking anyone who disagrees with them. Others create conspiracy theories, saying that most people think otherwise because they followed the herd, not possessing a genuine, personal opinion.\r\n\r\nIf you love the art of filmmaking, if you enjoy going to the film theater, then watching older movies will only improve upon that passion. However, there's a certain responsibility that the viewer should always have. As a spectator, we must always be able to place ourselves in the adequate period. We can't watch a 1941's film with the cultural, technological, social rules, and mentality of 2020. It would be extremely unfair to these movies since our enjoyment will be affected by modern political views, religious perspectives, and historical differences. We will look at a film like Citizen Kane, and deceivingly think: \"I don't see anything remotely new or innovative in any shape or form\".\r\n\r\nThis leads me to a suggestion I always give every movie lover like me. It doesn't matter too much if you do this before or after the actual viewing of an \"old film\", but do a quick research on its impact on filmmaking and our culture. Understand why or what makes the movie so special. Learn what to look out for when watching the film, and adjust your knowledge of everything to the year of release. Try imagining yourself as a person living in that year, leaving home to go to the closest movie theater, and sitting in your favorite spot to watch a new motion picture. If you're able to do all of this, then there's absolutely no way of not acknowledging the unprecedented, groundbreaking, historically impactful Citizen Kane.\r\n\r\nStill to this day, film critics get that childish, ignorant judgment of \"critics don't know how to have fun, they only value artsy stuff that no one cares about\". I'm not going to enter a debate about this, otherwise, I'd have to write an essay, but I will address that last part. The \"artsy stuff\" is what movies are made of. Without the artists behind each technical component, we wouldn't evolve to the point of getting the visually mind-blowing films we receive every month. Well, Citizen Kane impacted every single piece of cinema and shaped the filmmaking industry. People complain about directors not being able to share their original vision in 2020? Try making a movie 80 years ago, where studios were always responsible for the final cut.\r\n\r\nOrson Welles changed that process, and much, much more. From the original marketing campaign (it was the first time a trailer didn't contain a single shot from the actual film) to the inventive storytelling structure, there's no denying that the groundbreaking technical aspects transformed filmmaking forever. At the time, ceilings weren't shown, hand-held cameras were unheard of, the lighting had strict rules, and unconventional angles weren't used. Gregg Toland's cinematography changed all of that and tremendously influenced how movies are made today. His experimental methods gave rise to the imaginative use of \"deep focus\", where the camera shows the foreground, background, and everything in between, all in sharp focus.\r\n\r\nToland was so crucial for the success of Citizen Kane that Welles decided to share the credits spotlight with him. Vernon L. Walker, as the VFX supervisor, employed techniques so impressive that just a few months ago, we had the famous Corridor Crew VFX team breakdown a particular sequence, and most of them didn't know how Walker did it. The latter was a pioneer in shooting massive crowds and wide interior places. Robert Wise's editing is the main component in the famous breakfast montage, by creating a sequence in the exact same location while the actors change their clothes and make-up between cuts, giving the feel of time passing by even though the set design is still the same\r\n\r\nIn every other technical component, innovation is the keyword. Bailey Fesler and James G. Stewart employed rarely used radio techniques to simulate crowd noise and singing. Bernard Herrmann composed an unconventional score due to its pauses and short bits of soundtrack, something utterly different from the typical non-stop music of Hollywood films. Finally, Mankiewicz and Welles' screenplay. Its structure based on flashbacks and a nonlinear timeline was unique at the time. It's probably why the movie doesn't feel as old as other films when watching it today. Citizen Kane is decades ahead of its time, technically and story-wise. And its ending... still as powerful and jaw-dropping as in the first time I saw it.\r\n\r\nIt became the most influential movie in the history of cinema. It's constantly at the top of many \"best films of all-time\" lists, and it's still the number one movie for several critics. Orson Welles' film is probably the movie with the most amount of hype one ever got, to the point of making people afraid of even saying that \"it's fine\", let alone dislike it. If you think Citizen Kane is a bit boring or that the actors aren't that good or even if you weren't surprised by anything... you're far from being alone. People talk about this film like it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, a movie that will take people to Mars or to another galaxy. It's understandable if many viewers simply don't find any of the phenomenal qualities that everyone talks about.\r\n\r\nThe fact that most of the film is astonishingly innovative doesn't take away the other fact that it's still a movie from 1941. If it was released today (with all the natural modifications), most people would find it a very well-directed film, technically exceptional, and possessing a quite remarkable character-study. It doesn't mean it has to resonate with everyone. There's no movie in history loved or hated by everyone, and there will never be one. I don't ask you to learn to love Citizen Kane. I ask you to comprehend its legacy, background, and undeniable impact on filmmaking and our culture. Almost every film we see on massive IMAXs today, we owe that to Orson Welles and his visionary production.\r\n\r\n80 years after its release, Citizen Kane continues to be addressed by many as \"the greatest movie ever made\". It became the most popular film of all-time, one that went through decades of in-depth essays. Everything that needed to be said about it has already been stated, recorded, and written. No movie warrants higher expectations from its viewers, but this massive hype makes it a dangerous film. People fear being judged for not understanding the worldwide acclaim or simply disliking it. Is it a tad boring? Are some actors flat? Is the story not as mesmerizing and memorable as you'd expect? Don't be afraid to say \"yes\" because all of these opinions are entirely reasonable. None of this contradicts the indisputable influence it had on filmmaking and in the history of cinema. Everything about this movie's production and origin, the precedent-setting technical aspects, and the innovative storytelling all prove that Orson Welles was a perfectionist filmmaker far ahead of its time. Is it the best film ever? That's a never-ending debate I don't wish to be a part of. But it's undeniably one of the most magnificent masterpieces of cinema, one that every movie lover must watch.\r\n\r\nRating: A+", "Outstanding film, no question.\r\n\r\n<em>'Citizen Kane'</em>, at least to me, feels like such a unique film in terms of how it is brought to life - I don't recall seeing anything that exactly matches it in that regard. It's thoroughly entertaining, I do love how it is crafted together. The score is terrific and the performances from the cast are excellent.\r\n\r\nOrson Welles, the director too of course, is perfect for the titular role. He is sensational, it must be said. He makes Charles Foster Kane absolutely fascinating, despite the questionable nature of the character. I basically enjoyed everyone else who came onscreen, the more memorable ones being Joseph Cotten (Jedediah) and Dorothy Comingore (Susan) - George Coulouris (Thatcher) has a few amusing moments, also.\r\n\r\nThe editing and pacing are two other things that impressed me, as did the fantastic <em>News on the March</em> opening. This is one of those films that I've heard about for as long as I can remember, so I'm glad to finally get it watched - added to the fact it didn't disappoint.", "_**Not the greatest film of all time, but has its points of interest**_\r\n\r\nAfter the death of an American newspaper tycoon with political aspirations (Orson Welles), his relatives and associates are interviewed with one reporter trying to figure out the meaning of his last word, \u201cRosebud.\u201d \r\n\r\n\"Citizen Kane\" (1941) was Welles\u2019 first feature film, which he co-wrote & directed when he was only 25 with a cast of theretofore unknowns (e.g. Joseph Cotton). It\u2019s regarded as \u201cthe greatest movie ever made\u201d by many respectable people and was, for instance, Roger Ebert\u2019s favorite film.\r\n\r\nCharles Foster Kane and his magnificent homestead Xanadu were inspired by media barons like William Randolph Hearst and his never-completed Hearst Castle. The concept naturally brings to mind Elvis and Graceland, Michael Jackson and Neverland, and Donald Trump and Trump Tower (or whatever).\r\n\r\nOn a filmmaking level there\u2019s a lot to appreciate, including techniques that were fresh at the time of its release, such as unusual camera angles, lens distortion and the creative use of flashbacks. Up to that point in film history, for instance, ceilings were never shown because that\u2019s where the mics were located, but Welles included myriad scenes from low angles with the ceiling obvious in the background.\r\n\r\nThen there are the interesting interpretations, including the two main ones, which seemingly contradict: The enigma view suggests that the nature of a person is ultimately a mystery based on numerous subjective truths of different people\u2019s perspectives whereas the rosebud interpretation proposes that a person\u2019s life can ultimately be figured out based on a key clue. In Kane\u2019s case, the clue is linked to lost innocence, the comfort of childhood, a mother\u2019s love and the lack of responsibilities thereof.\r\n\r\nAs far as entertainment goes, the flick starts with vigor and features some highlights (e.g. the lively dancing sequence, Kane\u2019s political ambitions and the hollow halls of Xanadu) and human interest (e.g. Kane\u2019s relationship with the amateur opera singer), but I found it unengaging too often. I simply didn\u2019t find Kane a fascinating enough character and therefore didn\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 the obsession with interpreting his life. Still, I wouldn't call this \"Citizen Suck.\" \r\n\r\nFor greatest movies ever made I\u2019ll go with flicks like \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d \u201cRunaway Train,\u201d \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark,\u201d \u201cDead Poets Society,\u201d \u201cThe Mothman Prophecies,\u201d \u201cWatchmen,\u201d \u201cThe Green Mile,\u201d \u201cStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home,\u201d \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d \u201cThe Horse Whisperer,\u201d \u201cLucy,\u201d \u201cTroy,\u201d \u201cOne-Eyed Jacks,\u201d \u201cMutiny on the Bounty\u201d (1962), \u201cTarzan and His Mate\u201d and \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d    \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in SoCal and New York.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+", "If ever there was a film epitomising the best and worst of the \"American Dream\" then this has to be the one.... Orson Welles has mastered the role of the playboy millionaire who decides to have a go at running a small provincial newspaper - ostensibly to empower the common people and give them a voice... Shortly his combination of wealth, determination and deftness has created a monster with tentacles into almost every aspect of American life; and with that, as they say about absolute power - a good dose of personal ambition and corruption. Gradually losing those around him who debate and challenge, he becomes an intellectual brute; a tyrant - and an emotionally unfulfilled one at that. Joseph Cotton is also superb as his best friend who suffers with his own internal turmoils as he watches the rise and rise of \"Kane\"; Everett Sloane as his long-suffering sidekick and Dorothy Comingore as his second wife \"Susan\" plays her role almost exactly as an immature child, in the care of a stern but equally immature guardian. It is as much a social commentary of 1940s aspirational America as it is a powerful depiction of megalomania - and although it has certainly lost some of it's bite over the last 80 years it still delivers a powerful analysis of the concentration of wealth, power, and influence that could easily be applied (to social media domination) today. As with so many Hitchcock films, Bernard Hermann delivers an enveloping score in which this all floats nicely - and technically, it wants for nothing - the eeriness and sterility of \"Xanadu\" contributing wonderfully to the last half hour of this enigmatic story.", "ctually every bit as good as it supposed to be. To anyone who likes to think they're being edgy by calling it overrated or whatever, I know you're just saying it because you think it makes you cool and counter-cultural or whatever, so I probably can't change your mind whatever I say here, but one thing anyone should try is watching all the Academy Award nominees, or at least the Best Picture nominees, from the 14th Academy Awards, in sucession, perhaps one a day. Despite only winning one award, and famously losing out on Best Picture, this film makes all the others look embarrassingly dated. Even the ones that are also very good look like Roundhay Garden Scene compared to this. It truly is a revolution of a film. Welles could have gone exclusively into gore porn after this and he would still be a good candidate for the greatest talent in American cinema. This film has already been rightfully praised so much it's hard to find anything new to say about it, so mostly all I can do is heap on more praise to the pile, but this film deserves it.\r\n\r\nA few things are slightly less talked about from this film that I do wanna bring up though;\r\n1. This is a lot funnier than people give it credit for. Welles himself called it a comedy, I believe, and honestly I can see that. There's some very witty dialogue. My favourite gag might be the \"FRAUD AT POLLS\" headline.\r\n2. Weird how Welles' obvious self-deprecating joke about how he inserted the screeching cockatoo to wake up any audience members falling asleep has been taken out of context and treated as serious by so many people. It seems obvious to me that it was as a sort of bookend to his relationship with Susan, referring back to the shadow puppet scene where Kane makes a bird\r\n3. The speech about the girl in the white dress is actually one of my favourite monologues in any film. The \"frame story\" actually has a lot of great moments that people often forget because they spend all their time praising the scenes with Kane in them (and fair enough, they are incredible).\r\n4. Susan's bad singing is some impressive work. It's hard to sing purposefully poorly without falling into cartoonist shrieking, but actress Dorothy Comingore is very good at sound just bad enough to be believable.\r\n6. I like how, unlike most films about \"corrupt rich people\", this doesn't moralise or turn its character into a Bond villain, but condemns what he represents far more strongly than if it did, because systemic critiques always hit harder than \"rich people are mean :(\", which is one of the most helpful to the status quo statements you can make, implying as it does that it would be fine if the ruling class could throw us a bone with a few more scraps of meat on it.\r\n7. The opening and final shots might be the best one-two punch of those two things in... certainly a major release American film, if not any film ever. We begin with death, and end with youth. All sounds pretty simple when you say it out loud like this but as I say it's already been analysed in so much depth all I can say is either redundant or just feels like explaining why a funny joke is funny.\r\n8. It's hard to review this without sounding silly. \"Masterpiece\" is hilariously understating it. Like, of course Citizen Kane is good. What do you want me to say?", "I watched it because it keeps getting mentioned as one of the best films ever made. I was disappointed. For me it is just average, the hype is unjustified in my opinion. There are much better films from that time and later on.", "Now I know why I'm stingy with 10/10 ratings. This .. Is the film.by which all others should be judged. It has it all. From the captivating storyline to the exceptional performances, this film truly sets the bar high for cinematic excellence. Its seamless blend of creative framing, music, and narrative pacing tells a story that can never be dated because it's universal and creates an unforgettable movie-watching experience. It resonates on multiple levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nI knew Orsen Welles was great, but this film displays his genius. Welles and Mankiewicz have truly created a masterpiece.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew of us escape our childhood slights and insults, but childhood trauma can create a lifetime prison. It is a complicated psychology that can resist the strongest attempts at fixing it. Few can even begin to explain the lifetime impact, let alone create a film that exposes this very subject. It's a monument to Welles artistry and craftsmanship.", "This is great but if it is actually the  greatest of all time then I\u2019ll eat my socks."], ["There are many great predictions hinting to future (it is from 1968 - can you believe it?) innovations throughout the movie. I might not have found all them because I keep falling asleep while watching it but I will keep trying to find them all.", "I believe that we should call it a modernism show, albeit exhibited in the form of a movie. While it might feel \"boring\", it forces you to rethink what philosophical level that a two-hour film can achieve. The focus on questions about life, intelligence, and time, is worth more attention than the sci-fi part (though the special effect of this movie is already way ahead of its time).", "The eighth wonder of the world. Easily 30+ viewings since I was a little kid. Nothing new to say here; simply wanted to add another pair of hands to the ocean of applause for my absolute favorite thing, the only indisputably perfect movie, the answer to the question of Is Life Worth Living, Man's greatest achievement, two thousand one a burger-flipping space odyssey", "I got this movie recently when it came out on Ultra HD Blu-ray simply because it was missing in my collection and, being a Sci-Fi fan, missing 2001 in my collection simply would not do. It is a movie that was made to rely almost entirely on the visuals. It could be said that it is a visual symphony if that makes sense. Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing. Thanks to this it actually made some sense to transfer this movie to Ultra HD Blu-ray since the originals were really good enough even though the movie was made in 1968.\r\n\r\nI remember watching this movie as a kid and was profoundly disappointed. I thought come on, where\u2019s the adventure, not to mention any form of action? Today I can more appreciate it for what it is. A visually stunning movie. I also can more appreciate the fact that the movie is trying to be scientifically accurate instead of going all out on the fiction part. The parts where gravity, or rather the lack thereof, was portrayed, that was really high tech movie making at the time. I also noticed now, when re-watching it, that all the screens are actually flat which also was really far in the future at the time. Actually it was still pretty much in the future back in 2001.\r\n\r\nHowever, even today, I have to say that I find the movie excruciatingly boring. It is two and a half hour long and it moves very, very slowly. It takes 50 minutes of movie time before we actually get to the main part of the movie and get onto the Discovery for instance. No matter how great the visuals are, there\u2019s only so much boredom I can stand before it starts to get to me.\r\n\r\nIn the last 30 minutes or so the movie starts to become very psychedelic. The part where Bowman is pulled into the vortex, the stargate, is going on forever and in the end it just becomes a blur of headache inducing color effects. The final parts of the movie with the three Bowmans of different ages is just weird.\r\n\r\nSo,as this is a non-professional and personal take on the movie I cannot really motivate more than 3 out of 5 stars.\r\n\r\nI hadn\u2019t actually planned to review this movie. Everything has really already been said about it but I could not refrain after having read this crap at Rotten Tomatoes:\r\n\r\nCritics Consensus: One of the most influential of all sci-fi films \u2014 and one of the most controversial \u2014 Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity \u2014 and folly \u2014 of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty well known that Rotten Tomatoes is the absolutely worst movie rating site around and the so called \u201ccritics\u201d are useless culture elite morons with an over-inflated opinion about themselves at best and politically motivated SJW asswipes at worst but still.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell is controversial about it? Reality check, there\u2019s really nothing controversial about it at all. It is just a fictional story in the future. Then we have that crap \u201cthe folly\u201d. What bloody folly? If anything the movie shows a much better future  than what we got. A future where the politicians apparently promoted advancement of science and space exploration which is the direct opposite to the money and oxygen wasters we have today.\r\n\r\nSure, if you indulge too much in smoking funny mushrooms or are politically motivated you can probably \u201cinterpret\u201d the hell out of any movie and \u201cfind\u201d whatever message you want but it is still bullshit.\r\n\r\nWell, that was my (controversial?) take on 2001.", "_**Inscrutable space science-fiction as cinematic art**_\r\n\r\nThe discovery of an ancient extraterrestrial monolith on the Moon leads to a mission to Jupiter, but the astronauts have unexpected complications with their vessel\u2019s onboard computer, HAL 9000. William Sylvester plays an official of US Astronautics in the first hour while Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood play the two functioning astronauts in the second half.\r\n\r\nCreated by Stanley Kubrick (director/writer) and Arthur C. Clarke (writer), \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) is an artistic sci-fi film about human evolution, advanced technology, the wonders of space, the routineness of space travel, artificial intelligence and the mystery of extraterrestrial life. It mixes elements of \u201cPlanet of the Apes,\u201d which debuted over six weeks earlier, with aspects of \u201cStar Trek: The Motion Picture,\u201d which came out eleven years later and was obviously influenced by this one-of-a-kind movie. \r\n\r\nIt begins with the \u201cdawn of man\u201d as a curious introduction before jumping forward to the 21st Century, which has been called the longest flash-forward in cinematic history. The depictions of space travel and life-in-space feel wholly authentic. \r\n\r\nBut \u201c2001\u201d is peculiar in that it rejects traditional techniques of narrative cinema and is often a nonverbal experience, which leaves some viewers in awe and others bored. It\u2019s not about conventional thrills, but rather disquieting awe. It\u2019s not easy entertainment, but meditative, transcendent art. The 1985 sequel, \u201c2010: The Year We Make Contact,\u201d is more standard and less ambiguous yet a worthy companion piece. \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack mixes classical compositions, e.g. \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d by Richard Strauss, with four creepy modernistic compositions by Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti. The parts of the movie that utilize the latter pieces really evoke an unsettling sense of the unknown.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part is the astronauts\u2019 exchange with HAL, which involves almost an hour of the runtime and is the only part of the film that generates a low-key sense of suspense.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don\u2019t believe that humankind began as apes (rolling my eyes). But, even if this were true, where did the apes come from? Did they just spontaneously manifest by accident? If so, when? How? Biogenesis is a scientific axiom meaning \u201clife proceeds from life.\u201d So what life form originally created the apes or the simple organisms that supposedly evolved into apes?\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 29 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/B+", "I saw it for the first time when I was in middle school. I thought it was the worst movie ever. Then, some time later, as an adult, I rewatched it and was amazed at how wonderful it was. It was so beautiful and magnificent that I could not believe it was made in 1968, and I thought it was an unprecedented and solemn historical work, like Goethe's \"Faust\" in literature, one of the greatest masterpieces of cinema that mankind has ever possessed. First of all, it is a film in which dialogue is reduced to the utmost limit, and even if it had been in black and white, I could have watched it ten times without getting tired of it, regardless of whether I could have endured the \"silence. It's Kubrick's magic that you can watch this film without any annoying sound effects like in \"Jaws\" but with classical music and with your heart rate regulated like in Charlie Chaplin's silent films. I don't know how well this film was received in the U.S. at the time, but in Japan, many people shy away from it, saying it is difficult to understand.", "**A magnificent film, with beautiful music and great visuals... but smug, empty and unforgivably overrated.**\r\n\r\nStanley Kubrick is, for me, one of those directors who so quickly impresses us with a great film, as it makes us doubt his competence with an absolutely pathetic trash. I know that the director's fans are going to crucify me, but that's how I think, and I even say more: with each Kubrick film I see, I am more convinced that an aura of unjustified \u201ccult\u201d genius has been created around him. I loved some of his movies like \u201cSpartacus\u201d, \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d, \u201cShining\u201d and \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d, but thinking about them and trying to compare them with \u201cClockwork Orange\u201d and \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d is strange. They don't look like the work of the same director.\r\n\r\nReleased in the 1960s, at a time when the space race was at its height and when the future of Humanity seemed, more and more, to be outside our planet, the film addresses the question of the evolution of the human species in a \u201csui generis\u201d way: it starts with monkeys and goes to the first contacts with extraterrestrial beings. The film was considered one of the defining milestones of sci-fi as a cinematographic genre, and I believe that this is indisputable. It's also one of the rare sci-fi movies that seems concerned with being scientifically credible, yet not without flaws that a good scientist will spot (and we might not).\r\n\r\nSet in a hypothetical future, the film shows what space explorations and life in colonies made in space and on the Moon would be like. However, it is still ironic that, after the 60s and 70s, space exploration has been so secondary that many questions, even today, whether we really should spend industrial amounts of money and resources on it. The future that Kubrick imagined in 2001 seems, in 2022, even more imaginative and far from happening than when the film was released. However, some things really did happen and are, today, normal: this is the case of video calls and the extraordinary advances in robotics and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nAmong the various merits of this film, we have to highlight the extraordinary visual beauty, the way the director worked with the visual and special effects and the excellent camera work. At a time when CGI was a mirage far from a filmmaker's mind, this film gives us images and visuals that look like they were made this year. The film simply hasn't aged a single day: we have clear images, magnificently crafted light and details, excellent sound effects, a cinematography that makes envy to many 21st century films and, also important, a magnificent soundtrack where \u201cBlue Danube\u201d and \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d stand out, helping to popularize these melodies.\r\n\r\nDespite these indisputable merits, I think this film deserves to be on the list of the most overrated films I've ever seen. And this is due, in good part, to everything else that I didn't say, and which is essential in a good film. Let's start with the absence of a script and horrible pace: for almost three hours, the film drags on unbearably in scenes of great beauty, but with nothing to say. It's truly exasperating. The only moments where the film really gains interest are when the ship's supercomputer turns against the astronauts, and even that segment feels loose, as if the script were a patchwork quilt. The allusions to aliens didn't fascinate me either, it's a regular clich\u00e9 when making a movie set in space. One point that also didn't help is the lack of good actors, or any decent work for them to do, and the fact that Kubrick shows us life on the space stations as if it were a stay in a luxury hotel. And what about the extraordinary sense of arrogant conceit that the film conveys? We are the ones who have to recognize if the film is good, it can't be the film telling us that every minute!", "From the opening bars of Richard Strauss's \"Also spracht Zarathustra\" you just know that this is going to be something unique - and that it is. Apes, playing by a puddle - occasionally engaging in some noisy territorial warfare with their neighbours until one morning, this great black monolith appears. Shortly afterwards these creatures have realised that old bones make new weapons - and that these weapons can kill! The next phase jumps forward four million years later to a mission to Jupiter where a crew of five astronauts under the helpful gaze of their \"HAL\" computer are making their way across space. Two of them: \"Poole\" (Gary Lockwood) and \"Bowman\" (Keir Dullea) are not in hibernation and are regularly engaging with there outwardly affable digital companion. It doesn't take the humans long to conclude that \"HAL\" might be both malfunctioning and malevolent, and all of a sudden the life of all the people on board becomes precariously balanced. Is \"HAL\" malfunctioning, or is it fulfilling it's programming and the crew are just not read in? What might that objective be? We know that the monolith has been seen since the apes, what does that mean? What is the symbolism of this perfectly hewn tablet of granite? Kubrick was visionary with this work. It is a tale of evolution, or progress - of intelligence. It doesn't always make immediate sense, but after you've watched it a few times, there are extra ingredients to this potent mix of adventure and intellect that emerge. The ending is a tad surreal for my rather non-lateral-thinking brain, but the trip they take and the trip we take are eventful and thought provoking. Of course, back in 1968 2001 was a lifetime away and obviously none of this came to pass, but if we renamed it 3001 and recalibrated, well I wonder...! Great stuff.", "Absolute classic, must see, one of the best scifi movies ever made", "This is the most pretentious crap ever made - but is it an amazing film? No. But it is an amazing _**piece of art**_. This is worthy of the label of film, but the label of film is not worthy of this. Kubrick has crafted a stellar and surreal experience, one of the greatest **_pieces of art_** ever made. Why, you ask, do I obtain from referring to this as a film? Because it is simply not, it is an overpowering sensory experience, not a film. If I seem to be losing my point, here is it straight. It\u2019s too good to be a film. I wouldn\u2019t say this is enjoyable, or entertaining, but it is a stunning experience. One of the greatest **_pieces of art_** ever made. I only lost a point because it\u2019s not a film. Kubrick is often critiqued for his icy cold view of human emotion, and this is no different. The most affecting and human sequence in the film comes ironically (spoilers) from the death of a machine. Check this out, it may not be entertaining, but it IS worth it.", "Pleasing on a technical level, even with barely anything to grasp story-wise.\r\n\r\n<em>'2001: A Space Odyssey'</em> looks and sounds exquisite, it really is seriously impressive in that regard for a film from 1968. That is, however, the only reason that this gets a passing rating from me if I'm to be totally truthful. The plot itself is rather disappointing, with not much meat on the bones.\r\n\r\nI get it's evidently going for the more artsy approach, made clear by the lack of dialogue/bona fide narrative alongside plenty of ambiguity. It's a Stanley Kubrick film after all, not that I've seen much of his work (this be the first, in fact); moreso what I've heard through the grapevine down the years. There are also a lot of long held, empty-feeling (as intended, I'd imagine) shots that bothered me throughout. It just didn't entice me, that's all. I can still respect it.\r\n\r\nGiven the aforementioned, the cast are basically nonentities - as harsh as that may sound. Douglas Rain does a good job, in fairness, and William Sylvester is alright. I can't say I blame those onscreen all that much, as they aren't exactly given much opportunity to showcase themselves.\r\n\r\nAs has been the case with a couple of other movies down the years, I'm certainly content to file this one with the 'I clearly didn't get it and I'm cool with that' tag. I'm still glad I watched it. I do appreciate it, if only technically, and naturally love that others love it."], ["Fun movie with an interesting story and characters but with an extremely na\u00efve ending.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I must to be seen by Frank Capra and a young James Stewart.", "There's an interview somewhere with Bette Davis enthusing about the skills of Claude Rains, and I think this is an example of just what she meant. He is the established senator (\"Paine\") who has taken the rather stoic view that representing big business some of the time allowing him to represent his electorate the rest of it is a path worth following. When his colleague suddenly dies, it falls to the very political machine he serves to find a replacement. The hapless governor (Guy Kibbee) couldn't make a decision if his life depended on it, but thanks to a lively family dinner alights on local boy scout leader \"Jeff Smith\" (James Stewart). The man in charge - \"Taylor\" (Edward Arnold) is convinced that this naive and optimistic young man can do no harm to a pressing project they are hoping to pass through the Senate imminently. Duly appointed, our trusting and doe-eyed young gent heads to a Washington DC where an admittedly rather sentimental bus tour reminds him that he is the heart of his great democracy. \"Paine\" has assigned the wily \"Saunders\" (Jean Arthur) to keep an eye on him, and pretty soon they have suggested he find a pet project. A camp for boys from underprivileged backgrounds. That's got to be a benign concept - except, well soon he's got the establishment that sent him there in a complete and pretty violent tizz! Gradually, \"Smith\" realises that his fanciful desires for his nation are but an illusion. Can he still win through, though? Frank Capra can't resist a little flag waving at the beginning, but once this story gets into it's stride it's a powerful evaluation of just how undemocratic democracies can be. Big business and vested interests prevail - however altruistic they may originally intend to be. Stewart delivers a character brimming with authenticity and integrity; ably assisted by the quick-tongued and very much on-form Arthur and by the always reliable Thomas Mitchell as the gin-soaked reporter \"Diz\" we build convincingly to a conclusion that.. well you'll have to watch. It's a great drama this, plenty of pace and a script that keeps each persona and the whole scenario engaging from start to finish. One of the best, I reckon - and if you can, it's well worth seeing on a big screen for two hours that flies by.", "**A strangely current film that, using comedy, shows us well the problems that affect our democratic system.**\r\n\r\nI only discovered this film a few days ago. It is quite evident that it has fallen into total oblivion and few people remember it. However, it is worth revisiting. It's a comedy in which an idealistic scoutmaster is recruited for the position of senator, finding himself in a corrupt environment where idealism seems to have disappeared. There is also a romantic plot essay between a congressman's daughter and the main character, but I think this is unnecessary as it serves absolutely no purpose.\r\n\r\nDespite being a comedy, the film brings us very serious messages that are worth reflecting on. The most obvious is the importance of fighting for noble values and just causes, regardless of whether they are difficult, raise objections or result in discomfort. There is a special nobility in pure idealists, even if their ideas are not very doable. The film also highlights the corruption in the political system, the promiscuity between politics and business, and the way in which a few men with political power and money control the media and stifle press freedom, restraining journalists and forcing them to tell their versions of the truth.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these problems persist, they have worsened and make the film very current. Politics has never been as badly attended as it is today; never has the poor quality of politicians been so evident; it has never been easier to be corrupt in positions of power; it was never been so clear the connection between political parties, big companies and banks, where politicians go when they leave the office. And with the amount of fake or highly manipulated news that circulates on social media like wildfire, it has never been easier to manipulate truth. For these reasons, our democracies, which we strive to build and want to preserve, are seriously ill. If people have dissociated themselves from politics, disgusted by what they see, and don't want to hold an office or exercise the right to vote, it's our fault, we let the rats take over the ship.\r\n\r\nThe film is not subtle, even though there is never any mention of political parties or North American states, and a clear warning is made that the story is absolute fiction. I can, therefore, understand the terrible reaction it aroused among politicians and the party apparatus, but it is still curious that it was banned in European dictatorships (I don't know if it reached Portugal, but it was banned in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and of Francoist Spain), fearful that the film would show the advantages of the democratic system. In fact, despite ending well, the film shows its most serious weaknesses. I also don't understand why the US Scouts refused to be associated with the project, considering that the film portrays a really good image of them! Nominated for eleven Oscars at the 1940 ceremony, it was one of the favorites that year, but only won the statuette for Best Original Screenplay, which makes it one of the losers of the night.\r\n\r\nWith excellent cinematography and incredible work on sets and costumes, it was one of the studio's biggest bets that year. The number of renowned actors among the cast is quite remarkable and shows the commitment and budget available for the project. James Stewart knew well how important it could be for his career, and his commitment was total, providing us with one of the most intense works he has done. Beside her, the friendly Jean Arthur ensures a strong and impactful female presence. Claude Rains and Edward Arnold also deserve praise for their work on this film, as does Harry Carey, who said more with a smile than with a full speech."], [], ["Better than <em>'D2: The Mighty Ducks'</em>.\r\n\r\nI rate <em>'D3: The Mighty Ducks'</em> more than that aforementioned sequel, but even so it's still a pretty lacklustre follow-up. The original is entertaining, none of the sequels are in my opinion. I, perhaps, like the premise to this one most, though I will say there's something about it that doesn't quite fit in with the trilogy itself.\r\n\r\nEmilio Estevez is, at least partially, in this third film. He evidently couldn't give enough time to it, you can hardly blame him to be fair. He's decent in what he gives. As he magically disappears at times, Heidi Kling (Casey) and Joss Ackland (Hans) magically reappear. Neither were in the first sequel oddly, yet come in like nothing has happened in this. As such, their storylines - particularly Hans' - don't hit all that strongly.\r\n\r\nThe young actors, at least in my eyes, give their best performances of the series here. I actually, properly, took notice of the likes of Joshua Jackson (Charlie) and Kenan Thompson (Russ). Elsewhere, Jeffrey Nordling (Ted) and Abraham Ford himself, Michael Cudlitz (Cole), are decent. A firmer plot makes the cast standout, who knew?!\r\n\r\nThis is a weird one to me, all in all. It's certainly better than D2, and yet it kinda feels out of place and slightly underwhelming."], ["_**That lovable Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of its own**_\r\n\r\nA has-been racecar driver in San Francisco (Dean Jones) acquires a Volkswagen Beetle and his luck changes on the raceway. He, his mechanic (Buddy Hackett) and potential girlfriend (Michele Lee) start to see that the cute vehicle has a mind of its own. David Tomlinson and Joe Flynn are on hand as dastardly villains.  \r\n\r\n\"The Love Bug\" (1969) is a fun Disney racing-oriented fantasy that inspired three sequels by 1980, a television movie in 1997 and a 2005 theatrical sequel with Lindsay Lohan. \r\n\r\nThis is a good flick when you\u2019re in the mood for some innocent fun, but I feel the latter three movies are the best ones: \u201cHerbie Goes Bananas\u201d (1980), \u201cThe Love Bug\u201d (1997) and \u201cHerbie Fully Loaded\u201d (2005) with the 1997 one arguably being my favorite (perhaps because it features the Dark Herbie and Alexandra Wentworth).\r\n\r\nBut this is the one that started it all. It features a fitting cast and superb locations. It\u2019s a tad overlong though and should\u2019ve been abbreviated by 15-20 minutes.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot entirely in California, including San Francisco, Big Bear Lake, Riverside, Agoura, Santa Clarita, the Monterey Peninsula, Cuddy Valley, San Bernardino National Forest and studios in Burbank.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "David Tomlinson was always pretty reliable as the go-to comic English gent, and he delivers quite well here as the supercilious car dealer \"Thorndyke\". He only deals in the luxury end of the market, so \"Jim\" (Dean Jones) is a bit surprised to find a dilapidated old VW Beetle in his yard. There's something very special about this little car, and soon the down-on-his-luck driver and his mate \"Tennessee\" (Buddy Hackett) have bought him, repaired him and named him \"Herbie\". Magically, his racing fortunes take an about turn and pretty soon his erstwhile owner is after him back - and is prepared to go to just about any lengths as they prepare to compete in one trans-American race and - to the victor the spoils and the the scrapyard with \"Herbie\" if he doesn't win. It's interesting that this was released one year after \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (1968) - so clearly the theme of magical cars was popular. \"Herbie\" is mischievous and not averse too the odd tantrum which gives him just enough of a personality, coupled with an on form Jones - to create an enjoyable tale of friendship and inter-reliance as well as one of fast-paced antics and even the slightest hint of romance as we tumble down mountains, slide in and out of mud and generally have our own sort of \"Whacky Race\". It's a bit over-scripted and probably twenty minutes too long - I think we all get the gist and could be getting on with the action a bit more quickly, but it's still a decent watch that reminds us of what was hugely popular in the late sixties."], ["It improves on the original, that's all you want from a remake.\r\n\r\nI just about, marginally, liked the 1963 film, whereas I actually did comfortably enjoy <em>'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey'</em>. The animals are as adorable in this as they are in the first film, with more definitive care taken for them - that's not, arguably, the case in the '63 production.\r\n\r\nThe premise is changed up in some areas, there's a scene that proceeds the conclusion which is rather nice and isn't in the other. The whole feel of this is more engaging, helped by the fact that it gives the animals a voice which works better than just a sole narrator; as was done in the 60s.\r\n\r\nMichael J. Fox is a strong choice for the voice role of Chance, while Sally Field and Don Ameche are solid in their roles as Sassy and Shadow respectively. Those three help make this a fairly enjoyable 84 minutes.\r\n\r\nAnother positive thing is the locations, with some wonderful shots of the environment that the animals traverse through. Overall, a good film - nothing more, nothing less."], ["Wonderful Verne adaptation.\r\n\r\nWatched this one recently and was delighted to find it stands the test of time as one of the better Disney live action films on the market. A quality take on Jules Verne's advanced story of subs and the atomic threat that was soon to become ever so prominent in the public conscious. This adaptation is a corking sci-fi adventure that benefits from great work from all involved.\r\n\r\nThe cast are just smashing, James Mason is the stand out as the barmy but intelligent protagonist Capt. Nemo, gruff and menacing with a dandy slice of camp into the proceedings. Then we have Kirk Douglas who out Popeye's Popeye, tough and rugged with a song and dance to help moral moving along, and even taking time out to befriend a seal to help jolly the film in heart. Peter Lorre is solid as ever, and Paul Lukas almost steals the show as the conflicted Professor Pierre Aronnax.\r\n\r\nThe sets are wonderful, the direction seamless, and the special effects make it hard to believe this was made back in the early 1950s, but ultimately its a story for adults and an adventure for the kids. Containing a giant squid sequence that sees Mason & Douglas fighting it to the death serves as proof positive that 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is an unadulterated joy. 9/10", "A stylish, colourful adaptation of perhaps Jules Verne's most famous story with James Mason as the superbly determined, if blinkered \"Captain Nemo\" who has decided that the best way to eradicate war is to destroy the tools of warfare. To that end, he targets warships at sea and sinks them by ramming them with his early ironclad submarine the \"Nautilus\". His tortured soul is cleverly epitomised by the rousing organ music and tight close ups of his face - and of his eyes. Kirk Douglas, Paul Lukas and a creepily obsequious Peter Lorre are rescued from one such attack and our tale develops from there. It's a great fantasy adventure story, tinged with some consciousness and even a bit of pity - though in the end I was definitely with \"Nemo\" so found the conclusion a bit disappointing. Definitely Walt Disney storytelling at it's best with some groundbreaking underwater photography."], ["When I was younger, I used to spend a lot of my life alone in a studio with one of those tiny little 15cm TVs you wouldn't be caught dead with nowadays, plugged in to a VCR player, and exactly three movies on VHS.

Things start to look up for all concerned though when the kids discover that she is a trainee witch, and when they meet \"Emelius\" (David Tomlinson) they embark on some adventures using their magical bed as their vehicle in the search for the missing part of a substitutiary locomotion spell that might just thwart the Nazis. As with \"Poppins\", the music and lyrics come from the Sherman twins and \"Beautiful Briny\" and \"Portobello Road\" are probably the two best from their not so catchy soundtrack this time. Lansbury and Tomlinson work well together with the former on good form as the ostensibly prim and proper, but actually quite feisty and mischievous would-be witch. The three youngsters also perform well, especially the youngest \"Paul\" (Roy Snart) who just won't let anyone else near the knob that controls the bed!

It feels, to me at least, kind of redundant trying to even write a review of it now. So really I just want to say that as a mid-forties cinema loving man I revisited the film recently for the first time in about 15 years and found it still had a magical kind of hold over me. Yes I still think it's too long, but ask me what I would cut out of the film and I'm at a bit of a loss to answer.\r\n\r\nOver the last thirty years or so it has become something of a focal point for parody, somewhat diminishing the actual film's first time appeal. Then there are the charges of it being hackneyed, but they are misplaced and very unfair for The Sound Of Music is an ode to life and music, nothing remotely hackneyed there me thinks. Bookended by stunning Salzburg scenery {seriously the opening helicopter sequence is breath taking}, the rest in between is a series of brilliant set pieces and some unforgettable Rodgers & Hammerstein tunes. Led by Julie Andrews & Christoher Plummer, the cast delight throughout. Yes, not everyone is note perfect, but it's a moot point really. As a guy it's at the one hour ten mark where I get something to hang my coat upon, from there on in the Von Trapp family, and their gorgeous governess, have me hook, line & sinker. The Sound Of Music, one of the greatest screen musicals ever. 9/10", "Heard great things, got great things.\r\n\r\nI've said it before, but musicals aren't my favourite genre - I don't dislike them at all, but if I were to rank my favourite genres they would probably be down low. Therefore, I always feel uncertain before watching them, knowing they could go either way.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Sound of Music'</em>, though, is a delight. As alluded to, I have obviously heard countless positive things about this film down the years so I'm glad it didn't disappoint. Despite a potentially damaging 175 minute run time, it absolutely flew by - superb pacing. I will say the last 30-40 minutes do feel like a possibly unnecessary add-on, but it all still makes for entertaining viewing.\r\n\r\nHow about that soundtrack? So many songs that have seriously passed the test of time in terms of relevance, I had practically heard of them all before despite never setting eyes of the film until now. \"My Favorite Things\" is the standout in my opinion, but all the music is excellent.\r\n\r\nJulie Andrews is terrific in the role of Maria, I will say early on I thought she might've been annoying given how excitable she is, but she quickly becomes great to watch throughout. Christopher Plummer is impressive, also. Those two are the clear stars of this, but all the other cast members do worthy jobs too.\r\n\r\nIt's, so I read, not completely true to the real life story of Maria von Trapp & Co. However, all I care about is whether it's an entertaining film - which this undoubtedly is. A must-watch!", "The opening scene from this film has been parodied umpteen times, and I think that just goes to show just how impactful Robert Wise's adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein story has been on cinema. The idea that one could have seven children is, frankly, quite terrifying (I have none) so I can readily empathise with poor old Julie Andrews \"Maria\" as she is despatched from the safety of her nunnery to be the governess to this extended brood in the home of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). After an initially hostile reception from both father and youngsters alike, \"Maria\" soon ingratiates herself with all concerned - except, perhaps, for the Captain's beau Eleanor Parker who is wonderfully elegant and aloof as the \"Baroness\" - and romance gradually takes firm hold. The anschluss injects some seriousness into the fluffiness of the plot - the family must adjust to their new Nazi \"protectors\", but when the Captain is invited to take up a commission in the Navy they realise that they must act. Though a little cheesy at times, Andrews and Plummer are terrific, the songs are the stuff of musical legend, and I suspect one of the things that makes this more enduring is the fact that it is based on truth. The happiness tinged with the peril of the enveloping ruthlessness of the Nazis gives this an authenticity that would have been felt by many in Europe as Hitler was in the ascendancy and Wise manages to capture a little of that feeling. It's got some classy supporting performances from Peggy Wood (the Mother Abbess), a super Richard Haydn as the charming, if slightly opportunistic \"Uncle Max\" and even the ordinarily upstanding nuns get in on the act. There is definitely a chemistry between the two stars as their love story enfolds with the help of the children, a rather lavish puppet show - and a bit of Strauss! It looks great, too - musical cinema at it's best, this..."], ["**This is one of the definitive 80s Action Films.**\r\n\r\nThere is no nonsense whatsoever, the plot moves along with such a pace that the viewer is not disturbed by implausabilities.\r\n\r\nBruce Willis plays the likeable \"regular guy\", who is forced bare-foot into unleashing mayhem and destruction, to perfection.\r\n\r\nHis brilliant opposite is Alan Rickman, playing the German villain Hans Gruber in such a way that you almost root for him to get away with his heist. Also, he thankfully dispatches the office sleazeball, Ellis, in a wonderful scene.\r\n\r\nThe bad guys in Die Hard are more likeable than their counterparts in other movies. They are allowed to be funny and charming, which is good because we as viewers spend a lot of time with them, so it's good that they are not complete douchebags.\r\n\r\nJohn McLane gets to do what many adolescent boys wanted to try: to drop something off the ledge of a skyscraper or down an elevator shaft, and see what happens. But he uses an office chair armed with a PC monitor and a block of C4 and watches as it drops, then explodes, wiping out an entire floor!\r\n\r\nEverything here is bigger and louder than other Action movies from it's time.\r\nMcLane drops bad guys and one-liners left and right, things and people explode, culminating in a grand finale that is as well paced and executed as any action sequence that came after it.\r\n\r\nThis film started it's own sub-genre, after it came not only it's own sequels, but a load of films that were described as \"Die hard on a...\" or \"Die Hard in a...\" Most prominent examples were perhaps \"**Speed**\" and \"**Under Siege**\".\r\n\r\nThis is entertaining as hell, it's a must-watch!", "Just watched this inexplicably for the first time, after having seen and adoring its first two sequels. As a teenager when this hit theatres, I never really felt the urge or inclination to see this at the time. Action films weren't big for me back then. Now as a father of a teenager myself, it's interesting seeing what's now considered 'a classic' for the first time.\r\n\r\nThis easily deserves its lofty status as one of the finest action movies ever made, especially of the 80's. Alan Rickman, now deceased, played with distinction one of the finest cinematic villains ever. This film--closely followed by 'Pulp Fiction'--is the most important work Bruce Willis ever made.\r\n\r\nI enthusiastically hope that should someday Willis either leave this plain or decide not to make any more DH films that they simply put the franchise to rest. He was born to play this character. Anyone else in his shoes could never fit the iconic bill.", "What can I even say about _Die Hard_? This is one of the most highly praised action movies of all time, and it has **actually earned that praise**.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._", "***Big, dumb, fun action flick with Bruce Willis and a skyscraper***  \r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1988 and directed by John McTiernan, \"Die Hard\" is the first of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. In this one New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) flies to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his wife & kids. When McClane visits Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her company\u2019s Christmas party a group of radical criminals take control of the skyscraper. Alan Rickman plays the nefarious mastermind of the operation while Reginald VelJohnson plays a cop on the ground that befriends McClane via walkie talkie. Meanwhile Paul Gleason is on hand as an exasperating police chief.\r\n\r\nThis franchise fills the bill if you're in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean \"dumb\" in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond \"genuinely good people may be flawed, cocky and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil.\"\r\n\r\nThe Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's \"The Gauntlet\" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's \"The Mummy Returns.\" Thankfully, \"Die Hard\" evades that ditch because it\u2019s not too over-the-top and it offers entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing one-liners, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story.\r\n\r\nWhile all five Die Hard movies are of the same action expertise, I prefer the sequels because this one takes place almost entirely in and around a skyscraper. I favor the wider location scope of the others.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B+", "One seized tower block, one sweaty vest and one big set of action cojones.\r\n\r\nBased on ex cop Roderick Thorpe's 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever, Die Hard, directed by John McTiernan, changed the face of the action movie. Starring Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alexander Godunov, William Atherton & Paul Gleason, McTiernan's movie went on to make over $100 million in profit at the box office alone. Spawning three equally successful sequels (at the time of writing), it began a franchise that showed that if done well, the action movie could be a dominant force in the world of cinema. \r\n\r\nThe set up is relatively simple, Willis plays New York cop John McLane who during the Christmas holidays is in L.A. to visit his estranged wife Holly (Bedelia). She works for the Japanese Corporation of Nakatomi, and currently she's attending the company Christmas party up on the 30th floor of the humongous Nakatomi Plaza tower block. Bad day at the office because a group of apparent German terrorists, led by the charismatic Hans Gruber (Rickman), take the whole building hostage: with one exception; McLane, who evades capture and launches a one man war against the terrorists. \r\n\r\nWhat follows is just over two hours of high octane action, smart dialogue and technical smarts. McTiernan had already endeared himself to the action movie fan with the ball busting beef stew that was Predator in 87, a fact not lost on Die Hard's co producer Joel Silver, who clearly knew that McTiernan could smoothly shift the action from the Val Verde jungle to the urban jungle of L.A. And he did. Next was to get the right man for McLane. Richard Gere was first choice but passed, so the makers took a gamble on Willis, whose career was at a standstill after his leap from TV show Moonlighting on to the big screen with the likes of Blind Date & Sunset barely making a ripple in Hollywood. The rest for Willis, as they say, is history. McLane is an everyman hero, streetwise, even slobbish, but identifiable to many with his work ethics, desperate heroics and emotional vulnerability. Willis attacks the role with a hunger rarely seen from the big male earners in filmdom. During the two hours and ten minute running time of Die Hard, Willis as McLane changed the face of the action hero for ever; even making a dirty white vest iconic in the process; the latter of which couples nicely with the hero being bare footed throughout for a nifty bit of writing. \r\n\r\nAcross the board the casting is flawless, Bedelia is spunky and driven, a woman worth fighting for. Veljohnson as beat copper Al Powell-McLane's walkie-talkie buddy and only link to the outside world-is memorable because it feels real, he has his own issue gnawing away at him, but his exchanges with Willis keeps the humanity grounded as the carnage unfolds. Gleason & Atherton are wonderfully anal as Deputy Police Chief and TV Reporter respectively, while Hart Bochner as Ellis dishes out one of the best weasel turns to have ever graced a movie featuring corporate suit types. But as Die Hard resembles the great Westerns of yesteryear, much like the great Oaters, Die Hard could only be as good as its chief villain. As Willis' McLane ushered in a new action hero to copy, Rickman's uber intelligent villain set a new benchmark. \r\n\r\nSnappily dressed, well versed and as charming as they come, Gruber in Rickman's hands is a villain you could quite easily root for! That's further testament to Willis' turn that Rickman doesn't walk away with the movie, both men are from different sides of the fence, good and evil, yet both are characters you can hang your hat on. Quite a trick from McTiernan that. Rickman is ably supported by the scary Godunov as right hand man Karl and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as the cold hearted Theo. Elsewhere the impact of Robert Davi & Grand L. Bush as the two cocksure FBI agents Johnson & Johnson (no relation) should not be underestimated. All the actors, of course, are indebted to the sizzling script by Steven E. de Souza & Jeb Stuart. So to is praise due to photographer Jan de Bont, who in collaboration with McTiernan, produces a camera work lesson for action movies, as the camera swoops in and around the tower, down elevator shafts and up tilt to roofs; with the fight scenes afforded a spatial sheen not expected in the confines of a tower block setting (the film was actually shot at 20th Century Fox's own 2121 Fox Plaza). Even the scoring from Michael Kamen and the sound tracking are of a high standard; check out the various \"mood\" uses of Beethoven's Ode to Joy from Symphony No.9 and Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 In G Major: Brilliant. \r\n\r\nThe 80s was well served by action movies with the likes of Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop proving massively popular. But just as Raiders Of The Lost Ark changed the game for action/adventure, so too did Die Hard. It's now the benchmark movie for action, a film that unlike Hills Cop & Lethal Weapon remarkably shows no signs of ageing either. It's no monkey in the wrench or a fly in the ointment, it's the daddy, and the one that all other action movies have to answer to. 10/10", "**Die Hard's fresh take on action heroes, excellent directing and pacing, and explosive effects make it a near-perfect action film and one of the finest of the genre.**\r\n\r\nDie Hard revolutionized the action genre by rejecting the muscle-bound action tropes of its predecessors and introducing a relatable fast-talking hero masterfully portrayed by Bruce Willis. Willis' John McClane receives more sympathy from the audience because of his everyman quality. McClane seems like an ordinary guy caught up in an extraordinary situation and is doing whatever he can to save his wife and stop the bad guys. This more conventional character makes Die Hard much more engaging because most viewers can see themselves in the movie. Mix in John McTiernan's incredible directing, Alan Rickman's standard-setting villain, and sprinkle in some Christmas music and holiday cheer for extra flavor and you got yourself one of the greatest action movies in history and the best Christmas movie of all time (Don't fight me on it not being a Christmas movie, please. Let me have this.)", "Hardened NY cop \"McClane\" (Bruce Willis) arrives at the launch of the new building where his estranged wife \"Holly\" (Bonnie Bedelia) works, only to discover that she's now started using her maiden name. Humph!!! Luckily (for us) this is just the start of his woes as \"Gruber\" (Alan Rickman) turns up with his well equipped gang intent on robbing the place of millions of dollars worth of bearer bonds in a complex and meticulously planned heist. The best laid plans, though, and soon the secreted \"McClane\" realises the dangers to himself and his missus, and so has to clandestinely manoeuvre himself around the incomplete structure trying to nobble the baddies and keep himself alive long enough for the cops and/or the FBI to show up. When they do, he soon discovers that but for the savvy \"Al\" (Reginald VelJohnson) they are all rather gung-ho eedjits. It's now a battle of wits between the two men and what ensues is action packed, genuinely witty and yep - it's definitely a Christmas film. Sometimes it's not so easy to remember why Bruce ever became famous at all, but when you see his natural charisma partnered here with an on-form Rickman (even if his accent has moments of madness all of it's own) and some suitably beefcake Eastern European muscle and we get some entertaining banter and loads of pyrotechnics at the denouement of an engaging thriller. Great fun!", "\"Die Hard\" is an utterly compelling mix of exciting action and some particularly bruising violence and some surprisingly quieter character moments (the wonderfully written and performed radio conversations between McClane and Sergeant Al Powell are a memorable highlight). The chief villain Hans Gruber is especially well written and he is so familiar with police and FBI procedures he has been able to draw up his plans accordingly and this means he is always one step ahead of everyone else. The best thing of all about \"Die Hard\" is that it is actually a good film and not just another noisy and generally brainless time filler and this fact alone must surely single it out in this particularly competitive genre."], ["It Lacks Qualcast Quality.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Lawnmower Man is directed by Brett Leonard who also co-writes the screenplay with Gimel Everett. It stars Pierce Brosnan, Jeff Fahey, Jenny Wright, Geoffrey Lewis, Jeremy Slate and Dean Norris. Music is by Dan Wyman and cinematography by Russell Carpenter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDr. Lawrence Angelo (Brosnan) is a big mover in the science of virtual reality.

There\u2019s a couple of small ligaments that link the two, but in the main (not Maine) this Lawnmower Man is its own entity and an obvious attempt to cash in on the then virtual reality zeitgeist.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLawnmower Man has a cult fan base, of that there is no doubt, where much like Tron from 10 years earlier, the effects work and the capturing of something very much being \u201cin\u201d with the youth of the time,  has proved perpetually appealing to nostalgists. But strip away these and you have your basic Frankenstein story for the 90s, a pretty standard story lacking intelligent smarts or deep thematic points of worth. And then of course there is the bizarre fact of having a film decrying the advancement of computer technology, by using computer technology to make the film\u2019s strongest moments! Hee. It\u2019s only adequately performed by the cast, and Leonard\u2019s direction matches his writing, which is mundane when not about the visual effects; effects work that dated very quickly as it happened.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOther cuts and sequels would follow, the former didn\u2019t improve the same basic problems of the theatrical cut, the latter releases proved to be laughably bad.

Unfortunately, the technology it uses was not.\r\n\r\nFinal rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole."], [], ["Fun and entertaining action flick. Sure, the effects look dated and a few unintentionally funny moments, but Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson were good together. **3.5/5**", "**A good action and suspense film, although with several flaws to point out.**\r\n\r\nThis is a pleasant thriller, which presents us with a story that does not seem original or unusual, but that works perfectly and pleasantly entertains the audience. It all starts when a young suburban teacher, married and mother of a girl, begins to have particularly violent flashes of memory. She has amnesia, she doesn't know who she is, and the increasingly palpable prospect of a dark past leads her to investigate things further, fearing the consequences that could come to her family. In order to carry out her inquiries, she hires a private detective, who appears to be just trying to charge her as much money as possible.\r\n\r\nI prefer not to reveal much more about the script, in order not to spoil it, but the truth is that I felt, when I saw the film, that the ideas were not at all original and that I have seen some films that sound similar. Of course, considering the number of films made per year, it is a reasonably minor problem and the most important thing is whether things work as they should. In this case, the film is effective and offers the audience what it promises.\r\n\r\nDirector Renny Harlin is competent enough for the job at hand, and ensures capable direction, but not without flaws. For example, he was unable to realize that the plot sounded excessively far-fetched, after a certain point, and that the film was a little long for its genre, making it advisable to make some surgical cuts in the editing room to remove fifteen or twenty minutes without notable damage. Somewhat as a result, the film has an uneven pace and sometimes wastes too much time, immobilizing the action and damaging the build-up of suspense.\r\n\r\nConsidering that it is a film with a lot of action, I believe it is fair to give special praise to the work of the stunts and also the makeup, special and sound effects teams. They are the ones who help create the chases, the shootouts, the explosions and all the other incredible scenes that put the audience on the edge of their seats. Without originality, but with effectiveness and professionalism, these artists made a magnificent contribution to the film, and it must be said. Without much original material (just one or two melodies), the soundtrack includes a series of quality themes that include Muddy Waters, Patti & Labelle and other artists, as well as a beautiful song by Neneh Cherry as the final theme. The cinematography, sets and costumes are standard and only give what they have to give.\r\n\r\nGeena Davis heads a cast full of good actors. She is a creditable protagonist and a good bet, giving us a consistent interpretation. However, she is much more insecure when the plot enters the romance. She is not a good romantic actress, and does not seem to have established a very good partnership with Samuel L. Jackson. This actor, who has no difficulty with action scenes, also seems like a fish out of water if things take a turn for romance. Luckily, the film doesn't require much of that, and the actor does an essentially positive job. Craig Bierko is a competent villain, and David Morse is a good addition, even if he has little time to do anything. Brian Cox didn't have time for anything, and I honestly think he was wasted."], ["Oh, you're right. The devil has come to Tsavo. Look at me, I am the devil.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost and the Darkness is directed by Stephen Hopkins and written by William Goldman. It stars Val Kilmer, Michael Douglas, Tom Wilkinson, John Kani, Bernard Hill, Brian McCardie and Emily Mortimer. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond.\r\n\r\nTsavo, Kenya and a bridge engineer teams up with an experienced professional hunter to hunt for two lions that have been attacking local construction workers.\r\n\r\nAs is often the case, one should seek out the real stories that are involved in this retelling of the real instances involving the Tsavo Lions\r\n\r\nThe story itself is awash with mysticism, the lions (Ghost and Darkness) act as some sort of supernatural beings, who we are told are offing the native folk purely for pleasure. There's an odd juxtaposition with this, in that in the midst of colonialism and macho posturing, the hunters of felines are forgivable because they are defenders of mankind - even though we know that man hunts the great feline beasts for fun regardless of this particular situation.\r\n\r\nVarious stereotypes fil out the screenplay, though not as to be insulting, but you feel that the pic as first envisaged would have had more to say on political frontage and period turmoil. It basically all ends up as a creature feature, two great white hunters facing town the monstrous enemy as their very lives become perilous by the hour.\r\n\r\nThe attack sequences are nicely staged, wonderfully primal in fact, ensuring that what the pic lacks in intelligent narrative worth it makes up for with thrills and genuine nervy suspense. So with Zsigmond providing some lovely African postcard lensing, and Goldsmith adding music that powerfully bounces around the locales, the tech credits are ensuring our eyes and ears are suitably stoked.\r\n\r\nOne key character's story arc is stupidly given short shrift, annoyingly so and coming off like someone ran out of time to either write or perform something else, and the uneven feel to it all tends to gnaw away at the enjoyment factor. Yet in spite of the flaws and unfulfilled promise there's a nice old fashioned feel to it, something that seems to have engaged the movie loving public more than it does the pro critics. Interesting that. 6.5/10", "I loved this movie when I got to see it when it was first released.  \r\nBased on a true story (in fact the only part that was made up for is the lions' den scene), this movie breathes Africa due to the incredible cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond.  Africa is as bright and as amazing in this film as it is in person.  There is no CGI, only real, trained lions and real effects.   \r\nSet during the European colonialisation of Africa, we focus on the British need to complete a railway bridge across a small river which is complicated by 2 lions who seem to hunt for fun, not just food.  \r\n\r\nEven now, 25 years after it was made I still love this movie.   And even knowing its plot by heart, I still clench a little and hold my breath a bit - the tension during the climatic scenes is that good.  \r\nAll of the leads give good performances, but Michael Douglas is the stand out with his grizzled big-game hunter persona mixed with the \"action-man\" persona that he honed in his 1980s films like Romancing the Stone. \r\nThe only part that falls short is the underwhelming score by Goldsmith which just reeks of missed opportunities - there is no real leitmotifs or even hints of adventure or Africa.  \r\nBut that aside, this is a great movie looking into an incredible story in one of lesser known parts of the massive African continent. \r\n\r\nThis is a movie who's story stays with you, much like Africa itself does.   \r\nI love this movie.", "**Overall, a good African adventure film.**\r\n\r\nOverall, I liked this film. Africa has always held a fascination for Europeans, and anyone who has lived there will certainly recognize that it leaves a mark, a kind of spell or enchantment. Anyone who is there for a while never forgets Africa, and always brings with them a little bit of this magnificent and martyred continent. The film manages to give a flavor of the wild enchantment of Africa, especially the natural beauty that hides in its most untouched regions.\r\n\r\nAnd that leads us to talk about the production and visuals of this film, which are simply beautiful and transport us very easily to the time portrayed. I'm not an expert, but I didn't notice any glaring errors, apart from some props that seemed too modern for the year 1896. Being a film that takes place during the British colonization of the African interior, it is naturally told from the European perspective, with the construction of a railway line being described as an authentic feat of engineering and courage of the English colonizers, determined to unite the continent from Cairo to the Cape despite the ambitions and demands of other governments, such as Belgium or even Portugal, who opposed the project. The cinematography is beautiful, the images use warm colors and the landscapes chosen as the location for filming couldn't be more beautiful. The sets, costumes and effects used in the film meet all the requirements and give us an additional touch of style and elegance.\r\n\r\nAs for the cast, we have some positive points and some downright negative points to take into account. On the one hand, Val Kilmer doesn't seem to have the necessary strength for the character he was given. He would have been much more effective in a role that didn't require so much action and physical effort. Still, he seems sufficiently credible to me as an engineer who goes to Africa for work and finds himself in a situation for which he was not at all prepared and in which he will have to fight to stay alive. The actor, it must be said, really seems to be in a pitiful state all the time, and I suspect that the weather was one of the reasons that led to so much obvious wear and tear. Tom Wilkinson, Henry Cele and John Kani are worthy additions who raise the overall quality of the cast and prevent this from being a one-man film. Unfortunately, I hated seeing Michael Douglas here. In addition to his character being an authentic egoic self-praise, it was invented just to satisfy this actor's desire to appear where he had no space or place.\r\n\r\nBeing an adventure film where we deal with animals that eat people, it would be a little predictable to have high doses of gore and broken bodies. However, the film is quite calm and does not show us scenes that are really bloody. The script is something that we need to develop a little. The story of this film is solidly based on an incident that took place in Tsavo, Kenya, in which a pair of local lions (not at all like the ones used in the film, as the Tsavo lion does not have a mane) began massacring the bridge workers who were carrying them. British were building, causing dozens of deaths. However, it is not a faithful portrayal of events. Of course, there is a certain amount of space to create, and I would place all the wild and crazy action scenes within this level of creativity inherent to any film. What I cannot accept is the subversion of the facts that happens when the character of the beast hunter played by Douglas is introduced. This character did not exist, the two lions were killed without help by John Henry Patterson, or at least he claimed so."], ["Well over one hundred years ago, Thomas Hardy experienced critical backlash against his novel \"Jude the Obscure\" and never wrote another novel. This film version is also controversial, but definitely worth a look. This stars Christopher Eccleston in the title role as a stonemason who yearns for higher learning and a better life. Eccleston's portrayal of Jude is excellent in that he is no Hollywood pretty boy. His ears are too big and his face sallow, but his expressions and gaunt look help his performance immensely, especially in the latter half of the film. Too bad the audience is left in the dark about what exactly makes his character tick. Jude's cousin, Sue, is played by Kate Winslet. She brings a professionalism to her role that almost overshadows Eccleston. Every nuance of her work here does not seem calculated, but very natural. Jude's wife, Arabella, who leaves him, but keeps popping back into his life over and over again, is played by Rachel Griffiths. Her character is a major flaw in the film. Gothicism was fading in the time this novel was written; readers were experiencing more realistic situations in novels by the likes of Charles Dickens, or fantastic situations in novels by H.G. Wells. Arabella seems old hat in a period film. When she is introduced, the scene is full of sunshine and Utopian bliss. Throughout the film, she appears in black widow's wear, striking a contrast against gray backgrounds and the forced happiness of Jude and Sue. This role screamed for a more intense actress along the lines of Nicole Kidman or Emily Watson. Griffiths does not have the presence needed. Any other actress would have taken the part and sunk her teeth into it, but Griffiths comes across as a pitiful old maid without a thought in her head. In the beginning of the film, in her cutesy courtship with Jude, another actress may have appeared whimsical and innocent, Griffiths plays Arabella like a moron. The director is well known in British and art house circles. His direction is expert, and different from other adaptations of long English novels. Winterbottom uses filmed captions to let the viewer know where Jude's travels take him. The film opens during Jude's childhood, and Winterbottom shoots the entire sequence in black and white, evoking antiquated romantic memories. The screenwriter, Hossein Amini, and Winterbottom load the film with too much sex, after a while it almost overshadows the plot and characters. The musical score and set design are marvelous and I would highly recommend this film to others, but maybe not as a study aid for Thomas Hardy-reading high school students. \"Jude\" has plenty of raw emotion, including the stinging fate of Sue and Jude's children, but Jude's character remains, pardon the pun, obscure. There is something great here, despite the flaws."], [], [], [], ["A Fish Called Wanda swimmingly sails through a screenplay fishing for eccentricity. You may or may not already know, that comedies are not my genre of choice. The heartless individual that I am fails to grasp humour in its entirety, finding the most unusual of gags hilarious yet the most mainstream of jokes unwaveringly pointless. \u201cClassic\u201d British comedy, despite being a patriotic Brit myself, is just one of those strands I\u2019ve never tangled with. \u2018Monty Python\u2019 and 80s sitcoms reassure my darkened thoughts where most others would laugh out loud, for I am dead inside.\r\n\r\nNaturally, approaching this classic that many deem utterly hilarious, had me both anxious and intimidated. All the signs were there indicating that I would not appreciate this. Two \u2018Monty Python\u2019 actors, in Cleese and Palin, teaming up yet again. A femme fatale central character that utilises her sex appeal to acquire anything and everything. British versus American colloquialisms. Yet, despite all these elements being fruitfully incorporated into the feature, I flippin\u2019 loved A Fish Called Wanda! A gangster, animal lover and two American con artists plan a jewel heist, to which the eponymous Wanda attempts to double-cross them.\r\n\r\nComedy, in my opinion, is most contagious when written well. The visual aspect is a product of the screenplay and performances. So when I acknowledged that Cleese himself wrote this hilarious screenplay, especially after the groundbreaking success of \u2018Fawlty Towers\u2019, I breathed a sigh of relief. The man is comedy gold, and I\u2019ll tell you why. A Fish Called Wanda isn\u2019t a string of random set pieces to which the characters must adapt to in order to achieve a comedic response, a formula commonly used in modern \u201chilarity\u201d. Rather it\u2019s actually the same scene repeated, but with comic illogicality emphasised with each repetition. Wanda insists on seducing George\u2019s barrister to obtain information. Simple? Yes. Durable? No.\r\n\r\nIngeniously, Cleese continues the affair throughout the entire feature, and solely focussing on the dynamics between Wanda and Archie. When does the hilarity ensue, you ask? Well, it\u2019s the unwanted surrounding characters that heighten the situation into the comedy stratosphere. Archie unexpectedly greets his wife when Wanda is hiding behind a cupboard door, after some \u201cnecrophiliac\u201d foreplay. Her locket is dropped (vital plot point!), wife sees it and instead of exploding in anger at the possibility of Archie\u2019s betrayal, she believes it\u2019s a gift and decides to wear it. This is without mentioning Wanda\u2019s \u201cbrother\u201d who walks into the room and pretends to be an agent investigating KGB operatives in the local area. Oh, and Archie\u2019s daughter is waltzing in and out of the scene to make matters worse. My description doesn\u2019t do it justice, but each time Wanda and Archie are together, the scenario constantly escalates. It really is edge of your seat comedy, and I can confidently state I was flailing my arms about like a fish out of water whilst laughing the house down.\r\n\r\nSituational comedies like this, when written incredibly meticulously, are able to re-ignite my soul. However, these sequences of awkward hilarity would not be possible without the detailed characterisation that seeps through the screenplay. Each character implements a unique trait and differing style of comedy into the fray. Archie and his general buffoonery. Wanda and her insistence on sex appeal. Otto with his disapproval of the word \u201cstupid\u201d. Ken with his on/off stutter. These are just the crust on the fish pie, for there are a ludicrous amount of personable qualities that bring these characters to life. And that is what makes the comedy feel so effortless.\r\n\r\nCrichton, in what was his last directorial feature, solely placed Cleese\u2019s writing at the forefront. No ostentatious camerawork or intelligent editing. With that, it can feel somewhat rough around the edges. The constant switching between Wanda\u2019s shenanigans and Ken\u2019s progressive task of murdering a witness (by killing her beloved dogs instead of, y\u2019know, her!), were abrupt and occasionally disjointed. Fortunately the rounded performances secured a narrative momentum throughout, never once depleting. Cleese, Curtis and Palin were exceptionally decent, yet it was Kline\u2019s excessive screaming and shouting that generated comedy excellence. Yes, the homophobic slurs are now outdated and unfortunately taints a portion of his character, especially since he continually maintains this remark throughout. But I appreciate that\u2019s a personal issue more than anything.\r\n\r\nThe characterised comedy is what matters. These minuscule fishes in the medium-sized pond that is Britain, swimming around causing hilarity wherever they rest their fins. Bolstered by fantastic performances, an engaging story and exceptional writing, Wanda certainly is a fish I shall be remembering. Modern comedy just cannot replicate this exemplary feature.", "**A light comedy that works reasonably well, but ends up being forgettable.**\r\n\r\nI saw this film when I was younger, fifteen or twenty years ago, and I really liked it. However, time passes, we change, and when I saw him last night I couldn't feel the same fun I had felt. It all starts with a robbery and the theft of a large amount of diamonds. The thieves are a team that doesn't know each other well, but where there is no honor: after betraying each other and one ending up in prison, the diamonds disappear. While trying to find out what happened to them, the group will have the difficult task of trying to elude the authorities and also kill the only witness who can incriminate them.\r\n\r\nThe film has a strong cast, full of notable names: Jamie Lee Curtis, John Cleese, Kevin Kline, Michael Palin and Tom Georgeson. Although the leading role belongs to Cleese and Curtis, neither of them is in very good shape and this gave way to secondary actors. Let's be honest: Cleese still makes a worthy effort, but it's Kevin Kline who exceeds all expectations. He's funny, sharp and works wonderfully alongside Curtis without her having the breath to keep up with him.\r\n\r\nDespite the cast's honorable efforts, the film is largely uninteresting. In the most technical aspects, it is absolutely banal in all aspects, and I would even say that it seemed to me like a cheap film that goes for very economical, but functional, solutions. The humor is there, it still works minimally and the twists in the script, coupled with the speed at which everything happens, keep the story moving forward without allowing the audience to think about it. But it's not a kind of humor capable of making us laugh. This film was nominated for three Oscars in 1989 and deservedly won in the Best Supporting Actor thanks to Kline's \"tour de force\". But the truth is that, today, almost no one remembers him. It left no memory, even in the comedy context of that time."], ["This isn't Monty Python's best.\r\nIn fact, it's very ordinary humor for the most part.\r\nThe story of another man living a life parallel to Jesus could have been much funnier than this. \r\nHowever, people who love \"dry humor\" may appreciate this one more. It isn't the slapstick humor that we usually get from Monty Python that leaves a person nearly dying of laughter.\r\nIt's very low key humor. The only memorable scene is the suicide squad that comes to save Brian, which lasts a few seconds.\r\nIt's not totally boring, but it comes close. 4/10", "**It's an excellent comic film, but much inferior to \u201cThe Holy Grail\u201d.**\r\n\r\nThere is consensus on the impact that Monty Python had on humor, and on the way comedy is seen and performed. After a bombastic television series and a highly successful first film, they decided to make this film which, in essence, is a satire on the great biblical epics of the past. In this film, we follow Brian, a man who was born a short distance from Jesus and is constantly confused with him.\r\n\r\nI'm not conservative enough to not appreciate a religious joke if it's good, and there are a lot of good things in this film, starting with the incredible performances by the Pythons, in particular Graham Chapman and Terry Jones. The humor is what they have accustomed the public to, and the film does not disappoint the group's fans. Even so, I couldn't help but have the feeling that this film was quite inferior to \u201cThe Holy Grail\u201d.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, I believe it is worth highlighting the costumes and sets, which are at the best level and set the story very well in time and space. And the final scene, where the crucified sing a well-known and very positivist melody, cannot be more surrealist than it is."], ["This was schmaltzy but decent and could have been a lot worse. Normally I run from this sort of film like the plague but Patrick Swayze's recent death and me greatly enjoying 'Point Break' recently made me want to check out another one of his finest roles ('Ghost' and 'Road House' will have to wait, methinks.). When I got my first DJ-ing job, working the night shift at the now-defunct K-102 FM in Woodstock as a teenager, I often received calls asking for any of the three hit songs from its stellar and nostalgia-wringing soundtrack: Eric Carmen's 'Hungry Eyes', Swayze's own 'She's Like the Wind' or the Oscar-winning 'The Time of My Life' by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes. It was interesting now, almost three decades later, finally seeing the music I had played on the airwaves eon before now shown in some sort of cinematic context.\r\n\r\nIt was OK to see as a tribute to Swayze's craft (he was trained in classic ballet as well as in acting) but I'm left with no interest whatsoever in either the sequel or remake, unless as a special gift for my lady, Tammy.", "Entertaining hit with lush Appalachian locations, but the writing doesn't respect the intelligence of the viewer  \r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Emile Ardolino, \"Dirty Dancing\" stars Patrick Swayze as Johnny Castle, a working-class dance instructor at a mountain resort in the Catskills in 1963. Jennifer Grey costars as \"Baby,\" the 17-year-old daughter of an affluent Jewish doctor vacationing at the resort. She takes the place of Johnny's dance partner after his partner gets pregnant, albeit not by Johnny. Baby naturally develops a crush.\r\n\r\nThis was the hit romantic drama of 1987, but it actually didn\u2019t make as much at the domestic box office compared to the other two dance flicks of the 80s: \u201cFlashdance\u201d (1983) made $95 million and \u201cFootloose\u201d (1984) $80 million while \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d brought it $64 million. The two main cast members are a highlight. Swayze was in his prime and Jennifer Grey cute & nimble, like a fawn. In reality Grey was 26 years-old during filming, although she passes for late teens pretty well. Swayze, however, was 34 and looked it, albeit trim and fit.\r\n\r\nThe lush Appalachian locations are outstanding and the story keeps your attention but you'll roll your eyes at the idiotic misunderstanding where Baby's father assumes Johnny's the one who got his partner pregnant and, for some strange reason, no one sets him straight. Not to mention, the characters always say the wrong thing at the wrong time, which perpetuates the misunderstanding. Also, the sexual union of Johnny & Baby is both premature and unbelievable in light of the time period, Baby's age (17 years-old) and her upbringing. Frankie Avalon was once asked about his early 60\u2019s \"Beach\" movies if the male-female relationships were as \"squeaky clean\" as portrayed and he answered (paraphrasing): \"As a teen back then 'going all the way' wasn't even considered an option.\" The obvious exception would be disreputable kids from the \"other side of the tracks.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, the fact that Johnny is having sex with the doctor's daughter, a minor at that, can't win any points in his favor. Hence, even without the misunderstanding there's little reason for the father to warm up to Johnny. So why does the doctor show respect for Johnny at the end, a dude who's fornicating with his under-aged daughter and is clearly much older than her as well, although it could be argued that he\u2019s na\u00efve and doesn\u2019t necessarily know they\u2019re having sex already. Flaws like these smack of lazy writing and are offensive to anyone with an ounce of intelligence.\r\n\r\nIf you can look past these problems, however, the film is entertaining. The dance sequences shown in the staff area are akin to vertical sex with clothes on. I guess that's why it's called \"Dirty Dancing,\" huh? Yet this is another flaw of the movie: these scenes are so amped-up and choreographed they shout to the viewer via megaphone: \"This is A MOVIE; it's NOT REAL.\" Nonetheless, Grey's a cutie, Swayze's The Man and the beautiful Appalachian locations are a highlight, filmed at Mountain Lake Resort, Pembroke, Virginia, and Lake Lure, NC.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 45 minutes.

It\u2019s hampered by a low-budget vibe, which I can handle, but not the uninteresting lowlife characters, their self-made conundrum, their interminably dull dialogue and the one-dimensional setting where about 80% of the story takes place in an old warehouse, not to mention no females in the main cast.\r\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s interesting to observe Tarantino\u2019s first serious stab at filmmaking and it has its moments of genuine entertainment.

What now ensues is a recreation of the planning and execution of their raid, their introductions to each other and that all lays the seeds for this over-rated drama of brutal mistrust and duplicity. Tim Roth probably stands out as \"Mr. Orange\" but the rest of the fairly well established cast offer us little by way of sophistication or subtlety as they try to decide which - if any of them - informed the police. It's violent but so what - it's not Scorsese, nor does the story really hold up after it becomes glaringly obvious what is actually going to happen at the end.

The film that put Stone on the map, Platoon is considered by Vietnam Vets as the most realistic. But in keeping the maxim of giving credit where credit is due, much of the success of Platoon belongs to military adviser Captain Dale Dye, who has been linked to pretty much every great war movie in the last twenty years. Much accolades to Tom Berenger as well, whose performance as Sgt. Barnes is the tour de force of his career. With a great script, great performances, and awesome cinematography, Platoon is a surefire classic.", "**A film with a good script and good characters, but which exaggerates some things and is as anti-war as almost all films about Vietnam.**\r\n\r\nThe Vietnam War is one of the most brutal conflicts the US was involved in the 20th century, and one of the first wars that Americans lost. Following the expulsion of the Japanese and the end of French colonization in the region, the effort to help democratic South Vietnam to survive the invasion by its northern neighbor, a pawn at the orders of the USSR, resulted in a bloodbath that it leaves dents in the American mentality. That's why there are several films about this war, and the vast majority are highly critical of US intervention. This film is just another one and brings us a story that is not very different from what we can see in \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d or \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d.\r\n\r\nCharlie Sheen gives us what we can consider his best and most solid effort as an actor. In addition to looking appropriately unprepared, like an ordinary kid who goes to a war he's not ready for, he makes a poignant dramatic effort and gives the character a well-done psychological evolution. However, the film also features two great actors who achieved a deserved highlight: Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe. They give life to two totally antagonistic characters who, with their conflict, almost jeopardize the operational viability of their combat group. The film also stars Forrest Whitaker, Keith David and an extremely young Johnny Depp.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has extremely solid points. Skillfully directed by Oliver Stone, who gives us one of the most intense and consistent works in his cinematographic work, the film was made in very good locations and manages to give us all the realism and tension we could want in a war film. The second part is particularly brutal, with very intense combat scenes, a lot of blood and scenes not suitable for impressionable people. I even dare to say that it is not a suitable film for anyone who has been in combat and has been left with psychological problems. The cinematography is deeply atmospheric, with a creative use of light, cloudiness, fog and vegetation, and very intelligent framing. The soundtrack features several deeply atmospheric themes, of which I highlight Samuel Barber's Adagio, one of the most poignant melodies in the classical repertoire.\r\n\r\nThe script is also full of qualities. Amid all the brutality and the usual messages about the futility and inhumanity of war, common to most films about Vietnam, a plot of bloody rivalry develops between two sergeants from the same platoon: one is a man with leadership skills who is determined to carry out the mission without allowing himself to commit unjustified excesses and brutalities; the other is a worn-out veteran who doesn't mind massacring everything he touches to do the thing. Obviously, things become unsustainable and soldiers' loyalties are divided, something that would be unacceptable in a military unit. It's good to see this, the rivalry gives more flavor to the film, even though it is completely absurd if we consider how much the military values obedience and the chain of command. In addition to all this, the film also divagates a lot about the use of drugs as a way of escaping the reality. This actually happened, and it was not uncommon to give soldiers exciting substances so that they could more easily withstand the hardships of combat, but it seems to me that the film goes beyond what is reasonable. Oliver Stone exaggerates in his portrayal, which is no surprise considering the films he has directed."], ["My go-to when I just want to sit back and relax, especially with the hot weather where I am (plus no A/C).

Though it's not mentioned in the interviews of either star or director, the wonderful car chase brought to mind that 'other' car chase Frisco Bay movie, 'Bullitt'. But given the remarkable landscape of the area, why not? One would be a fool not to push the stylistic envelope as far as the censors will allow. A film that would have made The Master of Suspense proud, methinks, and one that he himself perhaps would have done, had Joe Eszterhas' very fun script been around, during, say, the time of 'Frenzy', when Hitchcock was at his cheekiest.

Hell there was even protests during the film's initial theatre run as the gay community went up in arms about the portrayal of bisexuals possibly being mad murderers?\r\n\r\nYet for all of its taming over the years, Basic Instinct can at least now been seen as the hugely efficient mystery thriller that it is, one that is propelled by some very good performances by the principal actors. The strength in the story is not in the sex or blood, but in the character arcs of Nick Curran and Catherine Tramell (Stone). Curran is a man perched on the edge of doom who is controlled totally by the women around him. He is by definition a quintessential film noir protagonist, in so deep he ultimately will be resigned to his fate. Catharine Tramell is a ultimate femme fatale, beautiful and seductive, she's always in control, leading all male characters where she wants them to go. There's a delicious kink to the narrative, with Verhoeven gleefully pulling the strings, a smirk no doubt etched onto his face. \r\n\r\nThis is very good story telling, with a plot of substantial twists and turns.

Most glaringly obvious as a fault is that The Abyss, after holding us for 2 hours of engrossing cinema, can't quite seal the deal as a deep (hrr hrr hrr) message movie for the modern era. What isn't in doubt upon revisits to the piece is that it's at times spectacular, at others it's joyously ambitious, both things coming together in one big loud boom of being a blockbuster with brains. James Cameron can never be accused of not trying to entertain the masses, and here, with a bit more thought on a humanist level, then we would have been talking in the realms of masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe making of the film is itself worthy of a movie, a fraught and angry shoot with many problems, of which I wont bore you with as they can be found at the click of a mouse.

Simple, this film begins with the cunning maneuvers of a wealthy Proven\u00e7al farmer to obtain cheaply the land of a neighboring property. It turns out that the owner is not up to this. When he dies, a short time later, the property goes to an heir who lives in the city, is a hunchback and doesn't know much about agriculture, having to read a lot to come up with ideas to make the property profitable. Aware of its importance and envious of their neighbour, potential purchasers are boycotting access to water.\r\n\r\nFor city people, water is so guaranteed that we don't even think about how it ends up in our faucet. In the countryside, however, things are different, and it is not uncommon to have serious problems between neighbors due to irrigation water management. And this is becoming more and more problematic, as some areas face increasing problems of water supply and reserve. Provence is one of those places and today, the idea of a book telling us how many rainy days we would have per year is unrealistic.\r\n\r\nIn addition to having a very good story and very well written, the film features two great French actors named G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Yves Montand. Both are incredible at their work, with a muted dislike that seems mutual, yet Depardieu's much more urbane character seems able to ignore similar issues. It would not be fair of me to ignore the enormous contribution of Daniel Auteuil, who manages to be a despicable villain without, however, deserving our anger. We understand very well that his character is heavily manipulated by his uncle.\r\n\r\nIt is a discreet film, with good cinematography, magnificent colors and whose settings, of a delightful bucolism, are perhaps one of the best postcards of old Provence, where the lavender plantations, very scenic, but intensive and intrusive, have not yet taken over. place of cereals and olive trees. The sets and costumes are equally good, and the soundtrack does an impeccable job.", "\"Ugolin\" (Daniel Auteuil) returns from the war to his wealthy uncle \"Papet\" (Yves Montant) with some inspiration. He doesn't divulge his cunning plan until he is ready, and then presents the man with some perfectly cultivated carnations. It turns out there's money in flowers, but they also need a great deal of water. Gallons and gallons of the stuff. It occurs to \"Papet\" that their curmudgeonly neighbour might be willing to sell his land, upon which there is a clogged-up spring. No such luck there but an accident shortly afterwards fills them with hope. Sadly for them, their plans are further frustrated by the arrival of the hunch-backed and enthusiastic city boy \"Jean\" (G\u00e9rard Depardieu) and his wife and child who move onto the farm. They are decent and hard-working relatives of the dead man and are determined to use science to make a go of things. Whilst feigning friendship with the family, \"Ugolin\" and \"Papet\" cement over their water supply and leave them at the mercy of the unpredictable weather and a rather ropey cistern system. Their farming days would appear to be doomed unless God intervenes. What now ensues sees the family \"Cadoret\" increasingly struggle to make money breeding rabbits and growing fruit and vegetables - amidst the mother of all heatwaves, as their cognisant neighbours look on unwilling to point out that their salvation is buried but yards away. Will the cynical ploy of the \"Soubeyran\" clan prevail? There's a great cast doing the work here, with Auteuil especially effective as the slightly conflicted nephew who doesn't always come across as the full shilling; Montand as the calculating, dynastically motivated, manipulator and finally a great effort from Depardieu who manages to portray a man plumbing the depths of despair - whilst always seemingly open to a degree of optimism and hope, really compellingly. The drama is peppered with loads of earthy humour and the small town setting provides for many of the usual characterisations of village life that is sceptical of, if not downright hostile to, new arrivals. It's also quite a potent look at just how crucial running water is, too.

By chance, she will find a way to take revenge on him, on his perfidious uncle Caesar and all that village, which despised her father and where everyone, through their silence, contributed to his death.\r\n\r\nThere are very good people who say that this movie is one of those rare examples where the sequel is even better than the original movie. I appreciate and respect those who think like this, but honestly I don't really agree. For me, this movie is so inseparable from the first one that it's not even a sequel: it's a single long feature film that was released in two halves. So, I didn't feel that it was better than the first film: in my opinion, they are absolutely equivalent. About the script, which is excellent, I only have one negative note to make, which is this: I am not able to understand how Manon's mother left her daughter behind being a pre-teen, as she was in the first film. It is a point left in the air, which is not well explained.\r\n\r\nThis film has the same core cast as \u201cJean de Florette\u201d except for certain small changes that had to happen due to the entry and exit of characters. The focus of our attention is the beautiful and talented Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, in the prime of her youth. Her work was decisive in this film: she transforms her character into a resister, a survivor rather than a victim. For his part, Daniel Auteuil is believable, authentic and intense, giving us perhaps the greatest work of his career. Yves Montand is brilliant in his role, and it is very interesting to see how the actor shows, in his character, the passage of years and sorrows, becoming increasingly fragile and apparently ill. Claude Berri continues to provide solid and intelligent direction.\r\n\r\nThe film has good cinematography that transforms Provence into an idyllic place, where natural beauty is almost a character in itself. The rough landscape, with rocks and steep hills, accentuates the harshness of rural life and the difficulties faced by farmers to earn a living from that land. Unlike the initial film, where the inconstancy of the climate was one of the most focused themes, this film focuses on love (there is a triangle that appears at a certain point, and past loves with many consequences) and on the revenge of the young shepherdess. The film shows B\u00e9art in a scene of explicit nudity, without subterfuge or circumvention, the only scene where parents may feel the need to cover their children's eyes (I think some wives will also cover their husbands' eyes). As for the soundtrack, it is quite evocative and atmospheric.", "Continuing on from the story of \"Jeanne de Florette\", we have advanced many years to find \"Ugolin\" (Daniel Auteuil) and his uncle \"Papet\" (Yves Montand) running a thriving carnation business perfectly watered by their own spring. Indeed it's quite a feet of irrigation that has enabled them to enhance the family fortune by at least 50,000 Francs. As ever, though, \"Papet\" is looking to the future of his dynasty and so continues to pressurise \"Ugolin\" to marry. He's quite happy with the odd visit to the local whorehouse until he discovers \"Manon\". She (Emmanuelle B\u00e9art) is the daughter of the previous owners of the property and after her father's untimely death is now reduced to goat-herding in the hills. A chance encounter with new teacher \"Bernard\" (Hippolyte Girardot) seems to offer her the prospect of some joy, but it annoys the clearly infatuated \"Ugolin\" who declares his undying love for her - all to no avail. Gradually, village gossip about her father and his fate reaches her ears and thanks to a wayward goat, she finds herself in the position to wreak a little revenge on the \"Soubeyran\" clan and their complicit supporters. What will assuage her wrath? I didn't enjoy this so much as the first part of the story. Though it effectively deals with retribution and, to a certain extent, the superstitious nature of religiosity, it doesn't really develop the character of \"Manon\" as much as I'd have liked and it is a little as what can so often be said of the second act of a play - slightly rushed. It also, thanks to village elder \"Delphine\" (Yvonne Gamy), introduces a further degree of tragedy into this already sad story that seems odd to have been such a long-kept secret in a place where everyone knew just about everything about everyone else. Auteuil is again effective, though, as is a Montand whose character starts to lose a bit of his confident smugness as tables begin to turn and he faces his own, life-altering catastrophe. B\u00e9art brings a naive innocence to her character - but that's not to say she's meek, far from it - and by the denouement I felt that maybe things were concluding fittingly. It looks great and the score from Jean-Claude Petit sets the whole thing off nicely. Both films together offer us quite a poignant look at human nature - warts and all, and are really well worth watching. Just what do they do with the thrushes?"], [], ["**One of the pinnacles of British humor.**\r\n\r\nThis was my first contact with Monty Python, which I already knew famously, and I loved the movie. It is quite simply one of the high points of British humor. The film is easy enough to understand, parodying the Arthurian legends surrounding the quest for the Grail, but the story is just a pretext for successive jokes, each one better than the last.\r\n\r\nI don't know the group of comedians very well, but I do know a number of great British comedy actors here, starting with John Clease, Terry Jones, Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin and Eric Idle. They are very good individually, but priceless together.\r\n\r\nThe film has several moments worth mentioning, starting perhaps with the witch trial, and then moving on to the fight with the black knight or the knights who say Ni. It's not a very long film, but it's really worth seeing every comic situation. The dialogues are full of hilarious moments. The ending, however, is a little less strong than expected, which does not take away from the film any of its merit.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's not a remarkable film. There is no concern here with historical accuracy or rigorous recreation of the Middle Ages, nor does the film ask for it. We have stage costumes and props, obviously fake but functional, and interesting sets, in castles and in some reasonably well chosen places. There are some special effects and visuals, but they aren't notable. Be that as it may, it's a comedy that remains fresh despite the decades that have passed since its debut.", "Seriously, you could die laughing from this film.\r\nI remember the first time I watched this film, back in antenna days on the educational UHF station that was all fuzz, and even then I thought I would die laughing.\r\nThe story of King Arthur always did beg for such a satire.\r\nThe bits are almost all memorable. I durst not mention even one, because I would be tempted to mention a hundred more scenes and a thousand more lines.\r\nThis is very slapstick. I never thought I would laugh at cruelty, but when it is obviously so overdone that it can't be taken seriously, like a man having his arms and legs cut off and still thinking he's invincible, especially when the delivery is so perfect, I can't stop laughing. \r\nThere are some people who don't like this film, but those people are wipers of other people's bottoms.", "Fortunately for me this was a rather short visit to the surreal land of Monty Python, and though it does have it's moments, I was really quite unimpressed by their Arthurian antics. We start with Graham Chapman's King Arthur gadding about England tying to recruit some suitably worthy individuals to sit at his round table. Task complete, he gets a sign from God that they must undertake the most holy of quests - and find the Cup of Christ. It now falls to the other three - Cleese, Idle and Gilliam - to dress up in suits of armour and seek the grail amongst the innuendo-ridden kingdom. Along the way they encounter the Black Knight, a castle full of sex-starved maidens, some monks - indeed just about everyone you might expect from mediaeval society before a really annoying denouement with the \"Knights of Ni\" - all they want is a little garden, or two... All but fifty years on, it's probably not really fair to look at this with 2024 eyes, but this was my first time of seeing it and I was really left thinking - why didn't the police get involved earlier? It's not that the jokes don't work, well not all of them, anyway - it's that they so labour the punchline. It's as if someone took a thirty minute sketch show and decided to pad it out for an extra hour. Less could certainly have been more. There are a few fun cameos - Carol Cleveland's \"Zoot\" and Connie Booth's witch stand out, but otherwise I felt a bit like I was the victim of some very dated hype. I didn't hate it, but really - what was all the fuss about?"], ["Times are hard for \"Wallace\" and his engineering-minded dog \"Gromit\" so they take in a lodger. He's a penguin who settles in nicely over a bottle of red with \"Wallace\" but to whom \"Gromit\" takes an instant dislike. Indeed, their new guest knocks his nose so far out of joint that he packs his belongings and leaves. This is just what the penguin wanted - and soon he is adapting some old, remote-controlled, mechanised trousers in which to entrap poor \"Wallace\" so he can use him to carry out a daring heist. Luckily, \"Gromit\" didn't stray too far and when he hears his friend's distress calls he sets out to thwart whom we now know is the most wanted \"Feathers McGraw\". Inspired voice casting in Peter Sallis and some great detail in the stop-motion animation - especially some of the dog's facial expressions - work really well here to create a simple but quickly paced and engagingly scripted story that tugs on emotional heart-strings, makes us laugh and reminds us that polystyrene ceiling tiles were never a good idea. Hats off to Julian Nott too - that's a grand signature tune."], ["Nice comedy-drama about the youth at the small town of an Italian kid.", "**Soulful**\r\n\r\nWhy did it had to end... The movie was like a breath of fresh air.Every thing about it was so refreshing and soulful that you can never get bored of it.It's one of those movies that you can watch again and again and again...The music, the story, the acting, the direction, the editing, all of it makes this an absolutely beautiful gem of a movie. One of the best movies that i ever saw and will ever see not because it was any different from other movies or better written, directed or acted, but because it's MAGIC, it stays with you.The soul of the movie stays with you beyond the credits.It stays with you forever. I just can't stop smiling remembering the scenes, the smiles on the characters faces, the music... Everybody who wants to FEEL happiness must watch this movie.In one word it's just SOULFUL !!", "When you think about cinematography, nowadays you usually think about digital cinematography. But during the early '50s, '60s, and onward, there was a use of this thing called film. Film was what they used in cameras before cameras actually saved them into memory slots digitally. Projectionists actually had to crank the film projectors early on, before the automatic film projectors started coming in, otherwise the film would catch on fire. This movie is about friendship between a projectionist in a film watcher/altar boy, and the film watcher/altar boy was young, maybe 4th grade age. This movie is great! I haven't seen foreign films, in fact, this is the first foreign film I've ever seen. But I'm glad this is the first one to be a foreign film that is a first for me. Want to know why? Because this movie is phenomenal! The little soundtrack that there is has been greatly by whoever composed it. Jacquees Perrin is a good adult version of Toto. The only bad thing I have to say about this is the lack of character development in terms of Elena's character development. I mean, she is a love interest for until Salvatore gets back to the town after his stint in the military, and then she is never heard from again. This movie is a classic, and it is also the definition of a classic. Anyone who watches movies, or plans to see a movie should watch this movie. This is  a must see film for any era, and any generation of film viewers.", "**Magnificent.**\r\n\r\nI saw this movie for the first time a good few years ago, but I only decided to talk about it now, after seeing it again. For me, it is one of the best Italian films ever made. It's like a modern fairy tale, showing us the fascinating side of cinema and reminding us why we love it. Of course, everything passes, and cinema has gone through many phases, it has undergone metamorphoses, and the end of the great classic movie theaters was one of them. And now? The pandemic has shown us that cinema can learn to survive without its theaters. And if we consider the manufacture of televisions and sound systems increasingly \u201ccinematic\u201d and economically viable? Will the living room one day be our own private movie theater, with all the comfort and quality of the big screen?\r\n\r\nThe future is anyone's guess, and it's as wonderful as it is frightening, but let's put these digressions aside. Anyone who likes cinema should see this film. It has a good dose of nostalgia, it can move the audience (it moves me) and makes us think about life. It's a little difficult to explain, I think it's one of those films that manages to touch something personal in whoever sees it, and that's not easy to translate onto paper because no two lives are alike. It is also worth going to see the various films that appear on the screens of Paradise, and which are very fair tributes to several well-known films.\r\n\r\nThe cast has very strong names. It is one of the best films of Phillippe Noiret's career, which offers us such a good job that he could well have been nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor that year. Young Salvatore Cascio also does an excellent job and is believable in his role. Enzo Cannavale and Marco Leonardi also do an excellent job. Tornatore's steering is virtually flawless.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is equally remarkable: in addition to accurately recreating the times in which everything takes place, it perfectly shows the technical evolution of cinema, and the way in which the place itself \u2013 Giancaldo \u2013 changes over time. The choice of filming locations was careful, all the work with props, costumes and sets was meticulous, and the cinematography is very beautiful. The edition does not deserve any repairs, especially if we are talking about the extended version of the film. Ennio Morricone, with his work in this film, gives us one of the best soundtracks of his career, every melody is worth listening to."], ["**French-style grotesque surrealism, in a film with style but no content.**\r\n\r\nI think I got to know Jean-Pierre Jeunet in the same way as almost everyone who doesn't follow French cinema at the same time: through the film \u201cAmelie\u201d. The film brought the director international and is unanimously considered his greatest and most relevant work. Given how much I liked this movie, I decided to see this one, but my experience was different. If \u201cAmelie\u201d was magical and beautiful, this film is much more uninteresting. It was treated like a surreal nightmare: it's a story about a butcher who occasionally sells human flesh in a dystopian future.\r\n\r\nRegardless of how much I felt disgusted by the aesthetics adopted in the film and by its bizarre theme, there is no doubt that it was a work with notes of quality: the degradation of buildings and the environment symbolizes or synthesizes the degradation of morals and values. The cacophony of sounds and images, between the dreamlike and the grotesque, is purposeful and intense (for example, that moment when the sound of bed springs where a couple makes love mixes with the sounds of a girl practicing the cello or from another neighbor who paints the ceiling of his apartment). The director's marks of talent, the quality we saw in \u201cAmelie\u201d is here, but distorted and adapted to a much less sympathetic film project.\r\n\r\nThe film has good actors and the performance of each of them helps the film to become a little more palatable. Dominique Pinon stood out the most: he knows how to balance between seriousness and hilarity, and has a body and facial expressiveness that is remarkable. Jean Claude Dreyfus also deserves a positive note, while Marie-Laure Dougnac doesn't seem to me to have anything relevant to do other than appear ethereal, diaphanous as a mirage.\r\n\r\nBeing a film that cares more about style than content, it also presents us with a very sharp and stylized cinematography: I must say that I admired the camera angles and the filming work, quite original, but that I don't particularly like the color, where an ocher tone made the film excessively brown. And despite the efforts, the soundtrack is one of those innocuous elements, which neither enhances nor harms the film because it does not deserve our attention in a relevant way.", "I did really quite enjoy this film, but I'll be honest - half the time I had no idea what was going on! From the start I expected Steven Sondheim's \"Mrs. Lovett\" to be working on her pies downstairs, beneath the shop of \"Clapet\" (Jean-Claude Dreyfus). They all live in a France where food is very scarce and people have an habit of disappearing without trace! He also owns a rather dilapidated block of flats next door and he needs a janitor. Enter the poor, unsuspecting, \"Louison\" (Dominique Pinon) who needs a place to stay. He used to be a clown, but now the joke is very much on him as he meets the intimidating \"Mlle. Plusse\" (Karin Viard) and the escapades begin in earnest. To the chagrin of her father, he quickly falls in love with the daughter of the house \"Julie\" (Marie-Laure Dougnac) and in order to save their burgeoning romance, she has to seek the assistance of a subterranean section of society called the \"Troglodytes\" but more resembling a society of oilskin-clad moles. These folks live a scavengers life, ferreting around for grain and corn where they can find it. As \"Louison\" closes in on the secret of his employer, and his relationship with \"Julie\" becomes more serious, they must take to the bathroom and hope rescue comes before the hatchet falls a bit too close to home! I don't usually do surreal so well, but this is really quite an enjoyable farce of a film to watch. The characters - well, most of them, have just enough of an anchor in reality to keep it in this dimension; Dreyfus and his sidekick bring quite an entertaining hint of menace and there's a great scenes with Pinon and a knife through his head on a plate! Oddly enough, it does make more sense as it proceeds - it's just not always that obvious! Quirky and entertaining. Give it a go."], ["**Overrated **\r\n\r\nAn enjoyable film - just not as engaging as parts IV and VI. The argument that Jedi was ruined by little furry creatures is laughable as this instalment features a _little green muppet_. I was expecting Kermit and Miss Piggy to show up.\r\n\r\nOnce we get the impressive Hoth battle over with the film meanders and crawls along - padding out its running time with predictable romantic sparring and an extended and dull sequence on Degobah.\r\n\r\nThings finally pick up again at Cloud City but not enough to justify the worship this film receives. I much prefer _Return of the Jedi_ to this one - at least Return of the Jedi gets the emotional juices flowing. This one leaves me as cold as the snow on Hoth.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Ian Beale", "A masterpiece of cinema. The film transcends the franchise, seamlessly combining elements of myth, science fiction, fantasy, war film, romance, bildungsroman, epic and tragedy in a way that its sequels have been unable to replicate. It is a move without a moment of fluff. Cut anything and the film would suffer. Story, character, effects, cinematography, music, screenplay, acting, editing and action are all superb. One of the most artistically poignant films ever made. And because its style cannot be replicated, it will continue to appreciate with age. \r\n\r\nThis was a time when George Lucas still had integrity, as evidenced in this 1980 Rolling Stone interview (he has since contradicted much of what he espouses in both word and deed): https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-empire-strikes-back-and-so-does-george-lucas-19800612\r\n\r\nHere's a blog article shows Empire's cinematic chiasmus, or narrative symmetry: https://dejareviewer.com/2014/05/20/cinematic-chiasmus-the-empire-strikes-back-is-a-perfectly-symmetrical-film/\r\n\r\nMy favorite version is the Team Negative1 Renegade Grindhouse Edition, an unrestored 35mm scan complete with damage and dust. The Despecialized version is okay too. All official releases are desecrations. \r\n\r\nPeople may say that Star Wars is dead, but The Empire Strikes Back is deathless.", "It's a dark time for the rebellion; and us the audience as well.\r\n\r\nLuke, Leia and Han are fighting with the rebels in the hope of defeating the Imperial forces. But Luke gets a calling to the planet Dagobah, where under the tutelage of Jedi Master, Yoda, he hopes to become a Jedi himself, but that also brings him closer to his, and Leia's, destiny.\r\n\r\nLets tell it as it is, The Empire Strikes Back is a better film than Star Wars, not as impacting of course, but most definitely better. Technically, in story telling and in tone, it holds up well today and certainly warrants the amount of times it crops up in best sequels debates. That it's not actually a sequel is irrelevant, it is of course the filler in a wonderful sci-fi sandwich, because as second instalments go, Empire has few peers. With Empire Strikes Back we get all the whizz bang adventure strewn heart of Star Wars, but George Lucas (stepping aside for Irvin Kershner to direct) has also fleshed the story out with a serious dark tone that oddly becomes a bedfellow to the romantic fun on offer, where new and engaging characters (and creatures) add spice to this wonderful fantastical broth.\r\n\r\nAided by the considerable writing talent of Leigh Brackett (The Long Goodbye, Rio Bravo, The Big Sleep), Lucas took the bold and ingenious step of giving the bad guys the upper hand, in fact it could be argued that he was taking a considerable risk with his ending. Forcing his viewers to wait for the final chapter (three years later), after tantalisingly setting us up with a corker of plot twist (one which is still to this day as potent as it was back on release), Lucas pulled perhaps one of the cheekiest carrot dangles in cinema history.\r\n\r\nThough more famed for its dark undertones, Empire is for sure still a very fun movie, C3PO goes into camp overdrive and Han Solo ups his quip quota by some margin. Then of course there is Yoda, in himself a comedic joy. The action sequences beg for repeat viewings, a battle on the ice laden planet Hoth is a marvel and the choreography for Skywalker's fight with Darth Vader is out of the top draw. But ultimately it's with the dark side that the picture excels. Complex and amazingly posing moral quandary's, The Empire Strikes Back is quite an experience, one that will forever hold up to repeat viewings for this particular viewer. 10/10", "_**Fun, imaginative, iconic space adventure with a kick-axx cast**_\r\n\r\n\"Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) was the anticipated follow-up to the initial mega-hit blockbuster from 1977. It\u2019s an epic, but simplistic space fantasy about an evil empire and the noble souls who dare to fight it. The main cast features Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and the voice work of James Earl Jones (Darth Vader),  Frank Oz (Yoda) and Clive Revill (Emperor).\r\n\r\nThis is an amusing, inventive, iconic space adventure with a stellar cast. While I prefer the adult-oriented space science-fiction of Star Trek, I can\u2019t deny that this space fantasy grants you an entertaining two hours with lots of sci-fi action, space ships, a snowy planet, asteroid caves and mysterious swamps. I also appreciate the mind-powers angle. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Fisher is in her prime and easy on the eyes, not to mention Ford and Williams are at their charismatic best. Even the more obscure Hamill shines in his boyish youth. Then there\u2019s RD-D2, C-3PO and Chewbacca.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "Terrific, again.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Empire Strikes Back'</em> follows up on the greatness of <em>'Star Wars'</em> with a highly enjoyable sequel.

Elsewhere, Billy Dee Williams and Frank Oz make for strong additions. There are, once again, fun roles for Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew and Kenny Baker.\r\n\r\nI'd say its predecessor has aged better - though that's not to say this film looks even the slightest bit bad, as it still looks fantastic throughout.

Both are awesome!", "So, I was almost 1 when this movie dropped and, well, it started the opening night tradition.\r\n\r\nOK, well, how to do this? I guess we will start with the hate. I like to address the hate in movies, especially ones that are well regarded and loved.\r\n\r\nNow, I'll excuse it for the people that just don't like Star Wars. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.\r\n\r\nBut then there are the people that really hate Empire because of...reasons. And those reasons are Revenge of the Sith.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, panning Empire because of loyalty to the prequels--misplaced as it is--doesn't make I-III any better. It just makes you petty.\r\n\r\nNow, why its loved and, I'll admit, I am one of those fanboys that really do love this movie.\r\n\r\nFor starters, Empire went dark. It was the really the episode that the good guys lost and, that made it unique among, well, among just about every movie not made in the 1970s. I guess that is what made the 70s such a wonderful time for movies.\r\n\r\nWe could use a little more of that. We could use a lot more of that. We use a lot more gritty in cinema. And, we could use a lot more \"lived in\" Everything looks too clean.\r\n\r\nEmpire had that.\r\n\r\nAnd then it had that big, legendary, reveal that made all those kisses between Luke and Leia utterly wrong once the second big reveal hit in 1983...which explained that look Han gave Leia when she told him in the next installment.\r\n\r\nMoving on...\r\n\r\nWe have the Battle of Hoth, which, yeah, nerd awesomeness with kind of a WWI trench warfare v tanks feel and a WWII Evacuation of Dunkirk feel with the rebels on the run and the Empire forcing its way across the galaxy with brute strength.\r\n\r\nAnd that prolonged time on the Falcon, well, that was just brilliant for character development and, incest blocking.\r\n\r\nSo, really, honestly, there was way too much to love not to put Empire on the throne.", "I have reviewed this film before but I thought that it deserved an extra special mention. Yesterday, this was the first film I saw in a cinema since we were all confined to barracks - and boy what a cracker. Where to start with the superlatives? It's fantastic - right from the opening bars of John Williams' score; on through the three mini-adventures rolled into one, we are treated to a marvellous feast of well-written, snappily directed, entertaining action packed adventure. Picking up from the first film, our rebels are holed up on a frozen planet being relentlessly pursued by Darth Vader. When one of his probes discovers their icebound base, they've got to get the hell out of there. Now sure, the CGI suffers a bit after 40 years; and can someone please tell me what the point of these lumbering Imperial Walkers is? They are like metal polar bears that constantly trip over their own shoelaces, but aside from those most minor of criticisms we have a great story; characters that we care about (personally, I'm an huge Vader fan) and who develop plausible, credible personalities; the detailed animations of \"Yoda\" are superb to see again on the big screen and it builds excellently to a sword fight the like of which has not been seen since \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938). It is, I think, better then the first film and for my money is the best sci-fi film ever made. Made for the big screen - and brilliantly made at that!"], ["The Princess Bride is ultimately a story of love - of a grandather for his grandson, of Inigo Montoya for his murdered father and between Buttercup and Wesley.  It is an old fashioned fairy tale in a sense, but its imagination, wit and humour stands it apart from convention.  The characters are endearing and essential to the plot.  The pace of the film changes up and down beautifully throughout and the script is a joy, playing with words and ideas.  Humanity prevails in this wonderous tale, I learnt plenty from it as a child and I still watch it from time to time to remind me of the goodness within us and the ability to triumph over adversity.  The Princess Bride has a way of being traditional whilst challenging norms and that is why I will always love it.  10/10 for me.  The only criticism I have is that it is too male centric as many films and series still are unfortunately.  Although, saying that, Buttercup is much hardier than most princesses portrayed in children's films.  This is a film that appeals to adults and children alike.  Stop writing did you say?

They are masters of cinematic rhetoric. The unfolding dramatic situations and controlled dialogue are meticulously contrived. Cameron could probably have potted more if it wasn't for his earnest, simplistic messages (rich bad; nature good). All three movies (_Titanic_, _Avatar_, _Avengers_) plot along comfortably then suddenly spike spectacularly.\r\n\r\nBut no one has ever laid on the cinematic charm and cajolery like Stephen Spielberg. He was by far the craftiest manipulator of action and melodrama there ever was. He was the progenitor of summer blockbusters and all-ages, all-nations spectacles. At his best he had a gift for re-living and realizing that ethereal and irresistible childhood awe.\r\n\r\nIf _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ (NOT the sequels... NO, not even the father- son one) was made today, exactly the same way, okay maybe in 3D with updated CGI, it would surely land at the top of the box-office heap. It is essentially the first comic book movie that wasn't a comic book (bespectacled mild-mannered Archaeology prof by day and globe-trotting whip-wielding action hero on sabbatical). _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ (the first and only) is arguably the greatest adventure movie ever cooked up. And we, the abject audience, servile participants of the artifice, were licking its boots. We wanted Spielberg and his Indy to rope us in, reel us into the action, and completely have their way with us. We overlooked the emotional manipulation and contrived trappings because it was a pure freaking joy to watch, a Lucas produced godsend. Harrison Ford was born to play it just as Steven was born to direct it. It's really too bad they had to brand and knock off inferior sequels that, while making oodles of money, tarnished the shine of the unsurpassed prototype.\r\n\r\nIndiana Jones was the perfect reluctant action hero on a selfless mission. A whip-snapping, truck-wrangling, swordster-gunning, Nazi- brawling adventurer who was matched only by his headstrong and sassy love interest, one pistol of a gal who could drink any man under the table. Not enough credit has been given to the great Lawrence Kasdan as the writer of this marvellous adventure. The script is as close to perfect as anybody could scribe. Even a dialogue-heavy expository scene (poisoned dates) was infused with a tense element of suspense. Yes, the story was hyper-fictional, completely contrived, shamelessly far-fetched... and altogether delightful. I wasn't expecting much when I went in to watch it back in 1981, but it had me wanting to do do back-flips on the way out. America's own Fab Four, Larry, Steve, Harrison and George, put on an action-adventure clinic.\r\n\r\nPossibly the only weak spot in the movie is the climax which had our hero and heroine tied to a stake while God, the almighty Mcguffin from the Old Testament, magically wrapped things up for them. \"Don't look\" Indy warns, with his patented crooked grin. Are you kidding? We can't possibly take out eyes off of this. With respect to lost Teddy Bears from space and anti-Nazi machinators, Raiders is Spielbergs greatest achievement. It is one of the finest films ever made, of its or any kind. It is, hands down, my desert island movie.", "I think for a lot of people, Raiders is their favourite (x) movie. Be that their favourite adventure movie, favourite '80s movie, favourite Spielberg movie, whatever. None of those ring true for me, but it is my favourite Indiana Jones movie. I was a mad fiend for Temple of Doom as a kid, and I've managed to make multiple teachers put The Last Crusade on in class, so I'm quite a fan of the franchise, but Raiders is the most enjoyable to me... I've never even seen Crystal Skull... So maybe it's dishonest to say I'm a fan of the franchise... I'm a fan of the trilogy!\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._", "Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nFor Spielberg's American Alan Quartermaine, I can certainly understand what the hype is about, but I've never been a big fan myself.\r\n\r\nFor starters, Nazis are boring.  I'm sure they were all the rage once upon a time as a classic villain, but it doesn't do much for me.\r\n\r\nHarrison Ford, of course, carries the movie, but Karen Allen plays really well with him throughout the movie and is amazing in her own right.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, Spielberg is able to shoot a powerful atmosphere, and the movie is captivating and engaging.\r\n\r\nIt's not something I can watch over and over, but when I do watch it I know I'm going to get drawn in and have a great time.", "5 stars \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\r\n\r\nMy favorite action film of all time due to one of the most iconic death scenes at the end being my personal favorite and being featured in my melt movie lists on many different websites!!!", "This is trailblazing stuff - a great action film in the vein of earlier Technicolor swashbucklers. Harrison Ford is engaging and hugely charismatic and his battles with Karen Allen and Paul Freeman make for a considered, slightly dark but funny and memorable piece of cinema. So many great films have a depth in the cast that offers a multi-layered approach to storytelling. Spielberg cast John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott excellently as Ford's stalwarts. John Williams has a golden baton when it comes to action-scores (akin to Korngold) and the story clearly has a tint of George Lucas' imagination to it. Historically, there is plenty of fiction but that spoils nothing. Not the best of the series, but a very good start..."], ["One of my all time favourite sci fi movies. Set the bench mark for modern sci fi, should be considered a great like Blade Runner.\r\nGreat acting, story, soundtrack! 5/5", "**A film that was enough for more than one review: dream, nightmare, utopia and reality.**\r\n\r\nIt was in 1939 that composer and singer-songwriter Ary Barroso released the iconic song \u201cAquarela do Brasil\u201d. This samba became an icon of Brazilian music and was sung and disseminated by such noble voices as Francisco Alves, Jo\u00e3o Gilberto, Tom Jobim, Caetano Veloso, Tim Maia, Gal Costa, Erasmo Carlos, Elis Regina and, in English versions, Frank Sinatra and the Portuguese Carmem Miranda. Ary Barroso, however, never imagined that the mere sight of an elderly man, sitting on a beach on a rainy day while listening to his song, would end up inspiring Terry Gilliam to make a film. But, before these words can mislead anyone, and especially any Brazilian, it is necessary to clarify that the film has nothing to do with Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place in an unnamed country that lives under a dictatorship (okay, Brazil was a dictatorship when the film was released, but the similarity ends there). The government, obsessed with controlling information, has created a monstrous and highly ineffective bureaucratic system that makes fatal mistakes. It is because of one of these mistakes that a citizen is arrested and killed as a revolutionary, mistaken for the real fugitive. And so we meet Sam Lowry, a government official with a conventional life who is plagued by dreams where he flies like a bird and saves a damsel in distress. His life changes precisely when he meets a woman like the one in the dream and finds that she, too, is in danger of being arrested for another mistake.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen both movies, but I believe the critics who said there were similarities between this movie and \"1984\". I myself could see the similarities with \u201cMetropolis\u201d, either in the narrative or in the bizarre and exaggerated visual aspects. As in those films, we have a dystopian, totalitarian society, where the individual is stripped of his humanity and becomes a cog in a larger gear, serving the State. Of course, the film weaves a long and judicious critique around this, and the bureaucracy that the country sustains, and which is of little practical use. It also offers us some sharp criticisms of the futile needs and vanity of today's society. The big problem is that all this seems to have no meaning. In fact, the main plot ignores these issues: Sam, the main character, is not a revolutionary nor does he seem to have political ideas. In fact, if you look closely, he seems to act almost on instinct, living his life as if it were a dream. The main plot is underutilized and poorly harmonizes with the rest of the film, as if it conflicts with the visuals and the other points of the script.\r\n\r\nGilliam made an original film. Where he failed was in the harmonic conjunction of the pieces in his work. And of course, in the relationship with the studios, which almost forced him to accept a radical cut in the film, considered excessively long and expensive. In fairness, I can understand both sides: the studios were trying to monetize an investment and rationalize expenses; for his part, Gilliam did not want his creative work done in pieces, although it is clear where the money was spent: just look at the incredible visuals, the dreamlike way in which he expresses himself as a director. Jonathan Pryce is the featured actor playing Sam. He gives us a work of great quality and is very well assisted by Katherine Helmond, in a very interesting sarcastic role, and Kim Greist, his romantic partner. The film also features the participation of great actors of the time, namely Bob Hoskins, Jim Broadbent, Barbara Hiks, Ian Holm, Michael Palin and Robert De Niro. This perhaps shows the prestige and consideration that the artistic world already had for Gilliam: the actors, more than having a good salary, wanted to work with him.\r\n\r\nAll of this is very nice, but why is the film called Brazil, and why did I mention it in a song? I was also thinking about this for some time, it really is something that does not seem understandable at first glance. I saw the film and nothing seemed to give me the answer to the choice of title, except the insistence on the song, which is the skeleton on top of which the film's soundtrack was assembled. But perhaps Gilliam was trying to show us, through this song, the dreamlike utopia of Sam's dream compared to the fantasies of others and the dystopian reality of his life."], ["One of my all time favorites. It still contains some of the drama and suspense of the first but with far more action leading to what I find a far more appealing storyline. As with Cameron's movies he makes you feel for the core characters from the start rather than just a bunch of 'bad ass' marines (Although they are). The progression of Ripley was really defined by this movie the 'brave but scared' Ripley of Alien is gone and a more determined, meaner Ripley emerges with elements of the older nurturing character kept in check with a young girl called Newt. It definitely stands out miles compared to all the other 80's alien-type movies of that decade.", "\"Ripley and the Soldiers\" can be found in two versions: the short version that cuts from Midway station directly to the Weyland-Yutani hearing, and the \"director's cut\" which cuts to a waiting room with a wall size \"scenery channel\" display.\r\nWhen I first saw the short version, I wondered how Ripley was able to make an immediate connection with Newt. \"Sister solidarity\" sounded bogus, and the \"director's cut\" cleared up that mystery.\r\nThe more interesting \"director's cut\" reveals Newt's family on LV-426, a long discussion on what the surviving Marines are facing, and an action sequence featuring the deadly Sentry units. \r\nAs Ripley suggested, I.Q.s did drop sharply among the Weyland-Yutani brass, with Carter Burke sending a deadly directive to \"Hadley's Hope.\" \r\n\r\nIn short: Ripley is living the blue collar life by day and experiencing a recurrent \"Alien birth\" nightmare at night. Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lt. Gorman visit her, saying contact has been lost with LV-426. Signing a devil's deal with Weyland-Yutani, Ripley boards the \"Sulaco\" with a \"company\" of Colonial Marines. To her horror, an android, \"Bishop\" is part of the crew, recalling the murderous \"Nostromo\" science officer, Ash. The trash-talking Colonial Marines give Ripley's tale short shrift, as they prepare for the \"Bug Hunt.\" The armed-to-the-teeth party finds no colonists, but evidence of a battle to the death. Then something streaks out of hiding, pursued by Ripley. \"Mewt\" is the sole survivor of \"Hadley's Hope\" who views the soldiers with a disdainful \"it won't make any differene.\" A computer search finds the colonists clustered deep below the power plant.\r\nThe Marines descend into the sub-sub-basement level and find out how true Ripley's tale is. After retreating from Hell, the survivors seal themselves off from the \"Xenomorphs\" as best as they can, dispatching \"Bishop\" to bring down the other drop ship. The Aliens attack and the soldiers fall one after another, leading to an abduction and a face off in an egg-filled chamber. This sequel is superior to the first movie, and leads to \"Ripley and the Convicts.\" 8/10.", "**The Disney film of the franchise**\r\n\r\nA basic shoot 'em up that comes complete with soldiers greasing up and watching each others muscles and also added an annoying kid straight out of Oliver Twist.\r\n\r\nCameron took everything Ridley Scott slowly built up and tossed it in the trash can to make a cheap shot Stallone/ Schwarzenegger style action fiasco.\r\n\r\nPeople who like this one tend to not be fans of horror movies as they complain about the _dark nature_ of the horror film Alien 3 - LOL - and this is precisely the reason Aliens fails as part of the horror franchise that is Alien.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Charles Dance", "My mommy always said there were no monsters - no real ones - but there are.\r\n\r\nRipley has been found in deep space by a salvage ship and brought back to a space station to be awoken from her 57 year sleep. Here she is mortified to find that the planet on which herself and her now deceased Nostromo crew found the Alien, LV-426, has been colonised by Weyland-Yutani Company. Suffice to say that when The Company representative, Burke, tells her that all contact is lost, she's not in the least bit surprised. Unable to get anyone to believe her about what happened to the Nostromo crew, Ripley is cajoled into going back to LV-426 with a crack team of space marines to seek, destroy or rescue...\r\n\r\nHow do you make a sequel to one of the finest, most loved modern era films ever? This was something that director James Cameron must have pondered on many a dark night once he had agreed to make Aliens. The answer was to rightly not copy the format so brilliantly laid down by Ridley Scott and his team for Alien, but to embrace its mood and enhance it with thrills spills and exhilaration. This was only Cameron's third feature length movie, and here he was working with the crew who had made Scott's movie so special. Also writing as well as directing, this could have gone very wrong indeed, but Cameron rose to the challenge admirably and set up his marker on how his film would succeed. Keep the premise simple and seamlessly connected to Scott's film, and lets have more. Not just one bad ass acid bleeding alien, but an army of them, and their mother too!\r\n\r\nThey mostly come at night - mostly.\r\n\r\nWhere Alien was a splicing of sci-fi wonderment and basic horror terrors, Aliens is a blend of war film staples to compliment both of those earlier picture things. Thus in keeping with Cameron's more is more work in progress skeleton. Another thing that Cameron instinctively called right was to make Aliens about Ripley (Sigorney Weaver simply brilliant), it's her story. Be it a parental thread or a feminist heroine fighting off the phallic hoards, cinema got in Ripley's extension one of its finest and strongest female characters ever (Weaver was nominated for Best Actress but lost out to Marlee Matlin for Children of a Lesser God). \r\n\r\nThematically Aliens has been pored over in regards to metaphors about Vietnam, foreign policy and corporate greed at any cost, and rest assured that Aliens isn't merely one big excuse for a shoot them up bonanza. But realistically, and explaining why it was such a huge box office success, it's with the thrills and terror that Aliens most succeeds. The action scenes are slick and at times breath taking, and the tension is often palpable. None more so as we enter the film at the half way point, because here we realise that we have characters to care about. Blood, brains and brawn, all led by a heroine of considerable guile and guts. 10/10", "How Disappointing ! \r\n\r\nThis movie, Aliens (1986) is a real fiasco. Especially compared to Alien (1979).\r\nJames Cameron ruined the spirit and soul of Alien for several reasons.\r\n\r\nThe first one, according to me, is that, unlike Alien, he is using too many characters. Almost all of the actors are lacking of charism, even Sigourney Weaver.\r\nThe soldiers show more muscles than intelligence and this is not reality, it is almost ridiculous.\r\nI do not understand why Cameron did that. It's unbelievable for a director who made in 1984 Terminator and in 1991 Terminator 2.\r\n\r\nThe second one, is the length of the movie : about 2h20mn. Too long, much too long.\r\n\r\nThe third one is the lack of entertainment. I'm sorry, but, compared to Alien, this film cannot hold the comparison. \r\nIt lacks of depth, and sometimes, it is better not to shoot a second part of a blockbuster.\r\n\r\nI recently watched Chinatown (1974), Rosemary's Baby (1968), Alien (1979), Fatal Attraction (1987) and all of them were great, but not Aliens.", "How do you do a followup to a classic like Alien? GIve it to James Cameron to amp it up to 10 with a bazillion aliens and a fantastic performance by Sigourney Reaver.", "A better sequel to <em>'Alien'</em> than I was expecting.\r\n\r\n<em>'Aliens'</em> - love the creativity, guys! - is a minute jot off the original but it remains a thoroughly enjoyable film - despite a slightly longer run time, which pleasantly doesn't hamper events. Sigourney Weaver is terrific again; I can see why these films launched her career.\r\n\r\nI will say parts of this 1986 flick are a tad repetitive from the original and a few bits are predictable, e.g. the arcs of Lance Henriksen's Bishop and Paul Reiser's Carter, but when judged overall it's another entertaining release from this franchise.\r\n\r\nI look forward to seeing if they made it a hat-trick with <em>'Alien\u00b3'</em>.", "**Overall : Aliens is an unparalleled essential that any sci-fi or horror fan needs to see.**\r\n\r\nThe original Alien (1979) set a new standard for sci-fi horror due to the fantastic vision and directing of the legendary director Ridley Scott. How could a green rookie director with just a handful of directing credits hope to top that? James Cameron found a way! Aliens improves on its predecessor in every way. Instead of a crew of civilian pilots fighting to survive a single alien, Cameron pits a squad of hardened space marines against an alien infestation. The experience, training, and advanced weaponry fail to protect them from the onslaught of alien xenomorphs, increasing the horror and hopelessness of the film. Cameron's camera work and perspective increase the tension, regularly showing the struggling survivors from the viewpoint of the stalking alien predator. The special effects, the action, the scale, the cast, the directing, the horror, and every other element of Aliens improve on the masterpiece of the original and result in the absolute gold standard of sci-fi horror.", "**_One of the best monster movies_**\r\n\r\nI prefer James Cameron's \"Aliens\" (1986) to its predecessor, Ridley Scott's \"Alien\" (1979), mainly because the story is more compelling. People often say \"Aliens\" is more of an action film than \"Alien,\" but it's not a mindless action film and, in fact, the action doesn't even start until a FULL HOUR into its 2 hour and 18 minutes runtime (the extended cut runs about 16 minutes longer). The best horror/action movies take this route -- taking their time to build character and suspense before unleashing the horrific mayhem.\r\n\r\nSome complain about the screaming little girl, Newt, but -- hey -- she's a little girl and I think the situation calls for this sort of response. Others complain that Bill Paxton is too whiny as one of the Marines, but isn't this the way SOME people respond when facing overwhelming defeat -- even hardened militarists -- particularly by hideous extraterrestrial monsters? Another complaint is that the Marines are depicted as dumb, arrogant \"oo-rah\" types, but I used to be a Marine and this was the way the over-the-top ones acted and, furthermore, these are the kinds of Marines that would qualify for such a dangerous mission -- the (over)confident wackjobs who would get the job done and done right.\r\n\r\nThe initial confrontation with the aliens at the hour mark is one of the most horrific sequences in cinematic history; and the Marines are thoroughly humbled. The rest of the film shows the surviving group literally sweating-it-out trying to figure out how to get off the planet alive where annihilating the creatures becomes a secondary objective.\r\n\r\nRipley's motherly love for Newt is a good addition and it humanizes Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). The sequences with the alien Queen make for a dynamic and extended climax. Also, Lance Henriksen is notable as the \"artificial human\" and Paul Reiser as an effective love-to-hate quasi-villain.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, the film is noticeably setbound, but that's par for the course for these types of sci-fi films, e.g. Star Trek. Another negative -- for me at least -- is that the film features no curvy babes, but this was the case with the first film as well, so it's to be expected. Besides, I think the female crew is more believable without someone like Juno Temple or Megan Fox aboard, lol.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that \"Aliens\" is easily one of the greatest monster films of all time, surpassing even the first film in the series and leagues better than the next two.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A", "**Even BETTER Than The First!**\r\nI LOVED this movie! The intense action, the gripping horror, the characters, the aliens, the ascetic...everything. And it takes its time to give us all the little hints and clues from the first film as we venture into this thrilling ride. Though I have much respect for Ridley Scott's first Alien film, this one just takes it to a whole new level in a way the first never could. THIS is how it's done.", "I LOVED this movie! I honestly rank this movie even higher than the first. The intense action, the gripping horror, the characters, the aliens, the ascetic...everything. And it takes its time to give us all the little hints and clues from the first film as we venture into this thrilling ride. Though I have much respect for Ridley Scott's first Alien film, this one just takes it to a whole new level in a way the first never could. THIS is how it's done.", "I have a simple policy: if the movie entertains like it's supposed to, I give it 10 stars...\r\n\r\n...That being said:\r\n\r\nI'm going to give you two words: \"Space Marines\" That's right, \"space marines\" I can almost see the pitch for this. We are going to take the Alien movie, the classic horror movie in space...and we are going to turn it into an action movie in space and completely change the direction of the franchise to the point where people are going to be hesitant to go back to the horror in space formula that worked for alien.\r\n\r\nAnd that is kind of what happened. The Alien franchise kind of lost its horror movie cred with Aliens to the point where Alien 3 got a lot of hate for trying to bring back the successful merger of horror and science fiction.\r\n\r\nAliens turned the franchise into a typical science fiction series...and that kind of hurts.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER\r\n\r\nYou still have Ripley and Ripley is still a super cool hero. And Aliens doubles down on her character and brings her from the tough survivor to a tough as nails warrior.\r\n\r\nAnd then you have a great addition of characters that quickly become beloved.\r\n\r\nAnd even if it changed from a horror movie to a basic science fiction movie with space marines, it was still a stellar science fiction movie. It was still stylistic and fun.\r\n\r\nSo part of me hates Aliens for making that turn from horror to straight science fiction. But the other part of me recognizes it as a a very good movie for what it is with a great cast.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to give it 10 out of 10 despite wanting it to be the same kind of film that Alien was. And, at the same time, I want to praise the risk it took for taking the franchise in a new direction.", "**A sequel on par with the first film, and one that helped cement the Alien franchise.**\r\n\r\nI really liked the movie Alien, the first of this franchise. There is no doubt that it is one of the best and most remarkable horror films ever made, and one of the \u201cfathers\u201d of contemporary sci-fi cinema. This film was thought to give logical continuity to the story started in that film, and I think it couldn't be better than it is. There are many people who consider the film to be excessively dated, with sets and effects that look old. I strongly disagree. It's true that digital and CGI are not here, but if you think about the amount of bad CGI and bad effects that we have to swallow in today's movies, it's really nice to see a movie with effects that work well and look amazing fifty years later. .\r\n\r\nWhen Ripley is saved over fifty years have passed since the events of the initial film. She arrives in a world that has continued to spin while she sleeps, and which does not believe her account. Still, they ask him to return to space when a colony, newly created on the planet where the first Alien was found, suddenly stops communicating. It's pretty clear that someone knows more than they're saying, and that there are, again, very strong interests from a financial point of view. But Ripley will figure it all out in due time.\r\n\r\nThe film is extraordinary and is completely at the level of its direct predecessor: the script has an excellent development, knows how to involve and capture the public's attention. Okay, there's a similar story, with the return to that planet and the return of the aliens, but the premise that leads to the return is the best and most convincing, and we don't feel tired or downtime. There's a pleasant tension, which deepens as the threat grows, and even when we don't see the xenomorphs, the fact that we know they're around increases that tension and the feeling of threat.\r\n\r\nCameron continues to prove his genius as a director, and manages to extract the best from everyone involved in his project. In particular, the actors. Sigourney Weaver is at the highest level and gives us an anthology work, which will open doors for her as an actress and which will mark her for life. The rest of the cast does not stand out so much, but we can praise the efforts of actors like Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein and Al Matthews. Carrie Hen, in part, is the weakest link in this cast, as her character only appears to arouse empathy and for us to connect more intensely with what we are seeing. The truth is that the way her character \u2013 a child \u2013 survives in that situation is frankly implausible, almost an authentic miracle.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is fantastic. It even seems like a new and relatively recent film, if you don't know what you're watching and that it was released in 1986. The cinematography is clean, sharp and there is an excellent filming and editing job. The effects are done the old-fashioned way, without the overwhelming appeal of digital, and they work amazingly well. See, for example, how the droid cut in half looks, how believable and authentic it looks. The alien is effective, menacing and fearsome, it looks like a weapon come to life and not a normal living being."], ["I'm looking for the owner of that horse. He's tall, blonde, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig!\r\n\r\nIt's debatable of course, since there are legions of fans of the first two films in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trology, but with each film there not only came a longer running time, but also a rise in quality - debatable of course!\r\n\r\nHere for the third and final part of the trilogy, Leone adds Eli Wallach to the established pairing of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and brings all his tools of the trade to the party. Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out?\r\n\r\nSuch is the genius of the narrative, it's a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there's no shortage of cruelty and humour. He also brings his style, the close ups, long shots and some outstanding framing of characters in various situations.\r\n\r\nThe story encompasses The Civil War, which pitches our leads into \"The Battle of Branston Bridge\", where here we get to see just how great Leone was at constructing full on battle sequences. It's exciting, thrilling and literally dynamite, whilst Aldo Giuffr\u00e8 as Captain Clinton turns in some memorable support.\r\n\r\nThe Euro locations pass muster as the Wild West, superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, and then of course there is Ennio Morricone's musical compositions. It's a score that has become as iconic as Eastwood's Man With No Name, a part of pop culture for ever more. It mocks the characters at times, energises them at others, whilst always us the audience are aurally gripped.\r\n\r\nThere's obviously some daft coincidences, this is after all pasta world, and the near three hour run time could be construed as indulgent. But here's the thing, those who love The Good, The Bad and the Ugly could quite easily stand for another hour of Leone's classic. I mean, more barbed dialogue, brutal violence and fun! Great, surely!\r\n\r\nFrom the sublime arcade game like opening credit sequences, to the legendary cemetery stand-off at the finale, this is a Western deserving of the high standing it is held. 9/10", "Sergio Leone's <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> is a classic Western film. Clint Eastwood is the Good, aka the Man with No Name, a taciturn wanderer who follows his own sense of justice. His opposite is Angel Eyes (Lee van Cleef), the Bad, a brutal mercenary who kills anyone who stands in the way of making ready cash. The film's comic relief is Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, a Mexican bandit wanted in several states who ends up inadvertently doing some good turns. At the height of the Civil War, as Union and Confederate armies battle each other in the West, these three men vie for an abandoned cache of gold coins.\r\n\r\nThe film is especially memorable for its pace and cinematography. The opening scene, for example, juxtaposes closeups of anxious faces with vast panoramas of the Western landscape, and 10 minutes passes before a single word is said. It is like Tarkovsky transplanted to a vastly different setting. That's not to say it's all so serious, though. In a sense the film is a \"two buddies on the road\" movie, with Tuco the wisecracker and Eastwood's character the straight man. It is also a war film, with Leone apparently sparing no expense in presenting a realistic image of hundreds of men charging each other on the battlefield. This is not among the greatest films I've ever seen, but it's very well-made.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a \"spaghetti Western\", an effort in the genre realized by a joint Italian-Spanish production team with American lead actors, the film has some curious qualities. Because of the use of locals, all the faces of Civil War soldiers are so clearly Italian, even though Italian immigration into the US picked up only later. The Mexican bandit Tuco is played by a Jew from New York, and furthermore Leone mocks the character's Catholicism in a way that Americans of the era would, although the faith would be in no way foreign to his Italian audience.", "I am not a fan of Sergio Leone. In fact, this movie and Once Upon a Time in the West are the only movies of his that I have seen. But I think they are both classic westerns. He seems to bring out the best in his cinematographer, both for scenery and for his characters.\r\n\r\nIn one review I read, he was criticized for staying with facial close-ups too long, and I would probably agree if he populated his movies with beautiful actors and actresses as many films do, but he relies heavily upon actors with interesting faces.\r\n\r\nSometimes I feel he relies on too many shootings, and on having his gunfighters be too damn good. Two, four, six opponents? Doesn\u2019t matter, these guys kill them all and come out unscathed.  But that is part of the western movie gunfighter mystique.\r\n\r\nOn a different level, I have owned the soundtrack for this movie: The Good the Bad and the Ugly, for close to 50 years. I write novels in my spare time, and I started listening to this soundtrack (plus others like Thunderball) for background music as I wrote. I moved on to Ambient music, such as Brian Eno, but still listen to this album. As a side note, I heard a great version of this movie music on YouTube, performed by the Danish National Orchestra. Check it out.\r\n\r\nSo the movie works for me on multiple levels, and I own a copy so I can watch it any time the mood strikes me", "There is one word to define The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. And that word is \u201ctranscendent\u201d. This movie is not only the pinnacle of the Spaghetti Western, but it transcended into the pinnacle of the Western genre in itself. It\u2019s safe to say it transcends that too, and can be considered one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking ever. It counts with memorable performances by three different leads, a story that breaks the \u201cblack and white\u201d concepts of morale, and an original score that can only be defined by the word \u201cepic\u201d.\r\n\t\r\nDirected by the man responsible for the revitalization of the western in Italy, Sergio Leone, the film does an incredible job of introducing every character, and showing each and every one has a dubious concept of moral values. \u201cThe Bad\u201d, Sentenza, or Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), is shown to be a ruthless, greedy gun for hire, but also someone who lives by the mantra of always getting the job done. \u201cThe Ugly\u201d, Tuco, is a  greedy backstabber, but he is also a man who comes from an extremely poor environment and family conflicts, showing a bit of determinism in the film. \u201cThe Good\u201d, Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is not much better himself. While he is surely the less greedy one, he also has no problem with killing and backstabbing other people. To put it in perspective, he is ironically announced as \u201cThe Good\u201d right after abandoning a man to die in the desert.\r\n\t\r\nThe story follows all these three personalities as they engage in their particular gold rush: a buried treasure that is hidden in a cemetery. In order to find it, they must form an uneasy alliance, while trying to outrun each other, and claim the prized gold alone. All of this while the Civil War happens around them.\r\n\t\r\nThe performances are nothing short of amazing. It goes to show the range that Lee Van Cleef had once this villainous role is compared to his work in the previous installment of the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More, as a heroic, friendly and almost fatherly figure. His presence is as intimidating as ever, and one of the best he has given in his lengthy career. Eastwood is as eye-catching as one would expect: his deep stares and lines delivered in a whispery, yet gravelly voice, defined The Man With No Name. But the best of the bunch has to be Eli Wallach. His comedic timing is as precise as any bullet shot in this film. But the most outstanding part of his characterization is that while he is extremely funny, he also manages to be a credible threat for the \u201chero\u201d, Blondie.\r\n\t\r\nThe original music score for this film deserves a whole book just to talk about it, and it still wouldn\u2019t do it justice. It\u2019s simply a lesson by the maestro, Ennio Morricone, on how music can change a film. Thanks to a track such as L\u2019estasi dell\u2019oro (The Ecstasy of Gold), a man running around a cemetery becomes one of the most epic scenes ever made. Thanks to a composition such as Il Triello, three men staring at each other, pondering their options for almost seven minutes straight, becomes tense enough to have the viewer on the edge of its seat. There is simply no other way to put it: Morricone crafted one of the best scores in this art\u2019s history.\r\n\t\r\nAt the end of the day, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is more than just a great western film. It\u2019s a show of great acting, writing, directing and music scoring. It\u2019s a real once in a lifetime classic, that has been around for a long time, and not aged a little bit, and will still be talked about for generations of cinephiles to come. To conclude, all I can say is\u2026 There are two kinds of people, my friend. Those who have watched this film, and those who have not. You watch.", "Solid western, which generally isn't a favorite genre of mine, with great performances and some well shot scenes and landscapes. Been a long time since I saw A Fistful of Dollars or For a Few Dollars More, but this is a great entry in the \"Man With No Name\" Trilogy. **4.0/5**", "Very good no doubt about it, even if I feel it's an odd fitting third installment of the Dollars trilogy.\r\n\r\nIn case this review sounds negative at any point, I wanna explicitly state for the avoidance of any doubt that <em>'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'</em> is very good! Any cons noted are relative.\r\n\r\nI just feel like it's a drop-off from the brilliant double of <em>'A Fistful of Dollars'</em> and <em>'For a Few Dollars More'</em>. The near 3hr run time is one of the reasons, though the pacing is actually pretty good in fairness. I guess it's more so the plot, which is filled with an American Civil War setting which I didn't feel matched the characters.\r\n\r\nThe man in the middle/bounty hunting aspects of the original two films are perfect for the characters of Clint Eastwood & Co., whereas them tagging along for the war just felt odd; the story didn't feel as raw or volatile to me.\r\n\r\nAs stated, it's still - on its own merits - an entertaining western. Eastwood remains quality, while Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are extremely worthy onscreen counterparts. I will say Van Cleef feels forgotten about, probably just by me, towards the end until he magically reappears. Still, as a trio they are really enjoyable. The plot away from the war is properly fun, much more in keeping to what I was expecting. The score is also awesome, yet again.\r\n\r\nMinus the ACW and a shorter run time and I'd probably be classing this as great as AFOD and FAFDM. It's still very good though, which I evidently want to stress, and I'd definitely revisit it.\r\n\r\n<em>watched: \"Extended English-language version\".<br>\r\nEven though this version is the same as the original Italian release (177 minutes), but seemingly the US shortened run time is considered the true incarnation? Odd.</em>", "Not as bad as the other Leone Westerns.\r\nStill, that is not saying much at all.\r\nAt 3/10, this is better than his totally ridiculous ones.\r\nIt's still a dull movie with non credible one dimensional characters who have no motivation for a single thing they do.\r\nThree homicidal maniacs who are called good, bad, and ugly, but really they're all just bad and ugly.\r\nEli Wallach steals the show. I think most people agree with me on that, and for some people he saves the show, but I need better writing, and more \"credible characters in incredible circumstances\" than we get with Leone.\r\nBlondie (Eastwood) kills anyone he sees in the wild. He kills other bounty hunters to steal their prisoner to bring in for rewards.\r\nIt's a good thing we didn't have Allied soldiers like Blondie, or else all Germans would have to do to win the war would be surrender and let American GIs kill each other to steal prisoners to bring in. Imagine that. We would have lost WW2 if our soldiers were like Blondie (or Manko, or whatever his name was).\r\nThe attempts to humanize the homicidal maniacs played by Clint and Eli only work for the brain dead idiots who buy into that. Such brain dead idiots don't last long in the hood or in volatile situations. Sadists do not get human. They only act human at times to get innocent victims to lower their guard.\r\nThe three man shootout at the end is stolen from the pair of movies \"The Jackal\" and \"Yellow Sky\", and I'm not sure if it's better or not. Neither one is in a top one hundred all time movie gunfights or showdowns. It's weak and stupid.\r\nBut when the spaghetti Westerns came out, the drug abusers and potheads loved them, and demanded they be acclaimed. The critics were either scared of the druggies or were druggies themselves, because the critics were bigger hacks than Leone for praising this garbage. \r\nHow long will we endure the crack head idolization of this garbage? Probably another 30 years or so, until we get some mature viewers who are willing to make up their own minds about what is classic, instead of being sheep.\r\nYep, Eli spoke of sheep in another Western, but it fits here.\r\nI give it a grade on a curb to make it 3/10, although compared to 1950s Westerns it is 1/10, but I'm lenient, because it isn't as bad as the other Leone Westerns. It isn't exactly \"watchable\", and you will fall asleep if you take it in one viewing, but the other Leone Westerns are even more boring than this one. Eli Wallach does do a great job, and for some people, that's enough.", "**One of the best, most famous and most iconic Westerns ever. More than a classic, it's mandatory.**\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert nor do I want to sound like one, but I think this is one of the most famous western films ever made, despite being shot by an Italian director and being more European than American. S\u00e9rgio Leone was one of the most notable directors of his time and he left us, in this film, one of his masterpieces.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those movies that is almost perfect. Problems and failures are scarce and reside in minimal details that end up not making a big difference in the overall work. The story was very well written and takes place in the midst of the American Civil War, a time when violence was part of everyday life. In this environment of violence and mutual distrust, two men are looking for a treasure buried in a cemetery: the problem is the fact that each one knows only part of the location (that is, one knows the location of the cemetery and the other knows which grave it is) and there is a third man, a fearsome assassin, willing to do anything to take all the gold.\r\n\r\nFor this film, Leone put together a very reasonable cast, mostly European, and three great North American actors with enormous talent: Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. I believe that they knew how to make the most intelligent and skilful use of this film, giving us a truly remarkable job. For this three actors, this is the best cinematographic work of their career, or one of the best, consecrating them as great Western movies actors. The film, however, seems to give Wallach more and better opportunities. While watching it, I got the feeling that he is the actor who receives most attention and best material, in addition to having known how to improvise at the right moments and in creative and intelligent ways.\r\n\r\nThe film has great visual beauty, emphasized by the cinematography, the filming work and the good choice and design of sets and costumes. At a time when the correct period recreation was something that cinema sometimes blatantly ignored, this film did the opposite, giving us a realistic and believable vision of the past and placing the film in a specific place and time. I'm not saying it was a one hundred percent successful effort, but it was definitely a decisive step in the right direction when it comes to period films. The special effects and visuals are excellent, the best there was then, and the whole film has an epic, grandiose, expensive feel. It is also very long, with almost three hours in length, but it is worth not being afraid or giving up on because of that. Being a Western film, it is quite evident that there is a lot of violence, so it is not a film for children. Even so, it is not gratuitous violence. Finally, we owe Ennio Morricone a salute for the excellent soundtrack he composed. Among his vast work, this is not my favorite nor the best, but it is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and iconic pieces, a work that we know, even without having seen this film, and that has become part of our collective memory. We can't ask for more than that."], ["Master piece. Fantastic script and evolution of the characters.", "Unlikely, but it is possible.\r\n\r\n12 Angry Men is directed by Sidney Lumet and adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. The cast is headed by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or innocence of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. Except for two short scenes at the beginning and end of the film, it's filmed entirely on one set, that of the jury deliberation room.\r\n\r\nSweaty, gritty, claustrophobic - all words that sit snugly in the context of Lumet's excellently crafted deconstruction of 12 men trying to arrive at one verdict in the case of a Puerto Rican youth on trial for the murder of his father. The evidence appears overwhelming, there's witnesses, a murder weapon and motive, the boy is surely on his way to the electric chair. 11 of the men are convinced he's guilty, only one man stands alone, Henry Fonda's juror number 8, who refuses to turn in a vote of guilty until the evidence and facts are discussed at length. As the others rail against him and tempers get frayed, juror number 8 prompts the others to examine their own prejudices and commitment to justice.\r\n\r\nA lesson in tight direction and editing, and with performances to match, 12 Angry Men is quite simply not to be missed by those seeking to venture into classic cinema. 9/10", "Jurors:\r\n\r\nMartin Balsam\r\n\r\nJohn Fiedler\r\n\r\nLee J.

Lee J. Cobb is also a standout.\r\n\r\nCrackling script by Reginald Rose, with superb direction by Sidney Lumet.  Full of memorable moments and great dialogue and character development; this is one of the greatest courtroom dramas this reviewer has ever seen.", "A timeless classic in which the characters really come to life. Slowly exposing each man's thoughts, personalities and prejudices, \u201812 Angry Men\u2019 isn't really about solving the crime, but about the power of reasoning, discussion and dialogue.\r\n\r\n9/10", "Unassuming. This is the first impression one may have, upon reading what this movie is about: 12 jurors deliberate about a murder case, where the accused suspect is the victim's son, a 18 y.o. boy. They must reach a unanimous verdict of guilty or innocent.\r\n\r\nAs it starts, it seems pretty much set, and everybody appears sure of the boy's guilt, except for one man. \"How can someone still have doubt, when so many (incl. more experienced jurors) are so sure?\".\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an exciting and carefully constructed script of more deeply detailed observation and reason-based discussions, often derailed by outburst of anger and impatience, as apparently firm evidence succumb to a more thoughtful and impartial analysis. Ultimately, not all is what it seems - specially true regarding *all* the jurors. Worth re-watching as much as you feel like finding all hidden clues and details therein.", "Twelve jurors are sent to their deliberating room after hearing the evidence in a murder trial. It's potentially the hottest day of the year as this collection of white, male, individuals take their seats around the table and wait for foreman Martin Balsam - none of the characters have names, here - to call them to order. A first vote is in order - it's a slam dunk - the accused is obviously guilty - 11-1! Henry Fonda is the dissenter. What has he seen that the others missed? What has he not seen that the others have understood? What now ensues is one of the best written and characterised, compelling, dramas cinema has ever produced. Excellent efforts from Lee J. Cobb, in particular, but from all concerned allow the tension to positively leap from the screen at us. This story gradually fills us in with the details of the crime, with the statements of the witnesses and, initially at any rate, illustrates just how cursorily many of these men treat this case. They want to get home for dinner, for a baseball game, to their wives and children. The fact that they are considering the life and death of an eighteen year old man seems tangential to the inconvenience they are facing or to the value they place on this man's survival. Reginald Rose's original screenplay takes us through the whole gamut of human bigotries and intolerances with everything from ageism, racism, respect and sexism rearing their ugly heads as the tension in their discussions rises and the true nature of these characters starts to emerge. Timidity, assertion, rationality - all are on display as these men start with a position that they may well not end up with. Ninety minutes seems far too short - but it works very well, rarely coming up for air - but what will their verdict be? Big screen if you can. Not because the scenario (a jury room) needs it - but there is so much energy and vitality in this film, that is just the best way to appreciate it a strong cast who put their all into their roles - and it works!", "**A very well-made film, with great actors.**\r\n\r\nAs a non-American myself, it's a little tricky for me to understand how well this justice system works. Don't get me wrong, but in my country it is not usual to resort to this type of trials, where the decision depends largely on the lawyers' ability to convince a group of jurors. Here, the decision depends more on the judge, or on a collective of judges. Resorting to a jury trial is provided for in Portuguese law, but must meet a tight set of prerequisites, which turns out to be a very unusual option.\r\n\r\nSo to understand this movie better I had to go read a little bit about how a real life jury trial works. And this is where my doubts about this film are greatest. Is it really a film that respects what really happens in the room where a jury deliberates what sentence to pass? Throughout the film, it is quite clear that the trial did not go well, mainly due to a largely ineffective defense and incapable of securing the interest of the accused (something difficult to admit, especially in a case of capital punishment). Could the jury have done anything about it other than pass sentence? I confess, I don't know. I leave this to the jurists, lawyers and people who can understand more about the subject.\r\n\r\nThe film is a bit like one of those plays that ends up being taken to the cinema: the action takes place overwhelmingly in the same environment, quite confined, and with a limited group of characters who interact with each other and dialogue. Dialogues are an essential part of the film and they are not always nice. It is noted that there is an increase in tensions, and if there are several jurors interested in dismissing the matter and leaving, this changes little by little, as the details are analyzed and doubts about the trial increase. It is a frankly well-written, well-directed film (Sidney Lumet's best) and with a strong and competent cast where Henry Fonda assumes an unequivocal role, giving us one of the best works of his career. Also, Lee J. Cobb deserves a round of applause for the way he interprets and acts, in a deeply caustic character. Every actor has the time and material he needs to do a good job, and they all did.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, it is an extremely discreet film, largely due to the low budget it was limited to. However, it is one of those films that proves that it is not necessary to have infinite money to do an excellent job. The setting is very believable, but where Lumet shined was in his clever use of cinematography and shooting angles to amplify feelings of confinement or discomfort. Sometimes, the camera gets so close to the actors' faces that we can see how much the excessive heat and subject tension is getting on their nerves.", "."], ["As time goes by, I'll always appreciate my Grade 10 English class (1984-85), taught by Mr. Terry. Looking back, it's probably the year that I was introduced to the most great literary works of all my life (especially 'Anthem' by Ayn Rand and 'Nausea' by Jean-Paul Sartre). Included that year in the course's curriculum was Anthony Burgess' dystopian masterwork, 'A Clockwork Orange' (as well as George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'--like Frank Sinatra would have said, 'It was a very good year'). I was mesmerized with it from the instant I noticed the unique approach to language, the 'ultraviolence' and of course, the eternal question of free will, its relationship to good-and-evil, and the can of worms of the myriad of ethical dilemmas that comes to the fore of individual freedom and rights versus that of society at large. The genius of Burgess was being able to put so well and forcibly, yet in such an entertaining way, so many issues that, had most anyone else set forth on the endeavor, would have come up with the type of off-putting, heavy-handed sermon that would never have reached such a literary pinnacle, and been required reading even now, generations later. It hasn't aged or dated a day.\r\n\r\nMost cinematic observers felt the book unfilmable. Director Kubrick's adaptations work so well, particularly this, '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Shining' (even though Stephen King would fervently disagree about the latter) because he, as he did with 'Dr. Strangelove', can so easily both find unforgettable visual metaphors for his ideas and so handily combine humour (an under-recognized trait of his, much more readily associated with say, Sir Alfred Hitchcock) with these heavy and daunting philosophical and intellectual volleys. In the wrong hands (particularly a Stanley Kramer, or his ilk), this could have failed miserably, like typical cinematic treatments of Ayn Rand novels. But this worked triumphantly, and heartily exemplifies one of the greatest directors ever at the apex of his craftsmanship. No self-respecting cinephile can avoid this movie, and I heartily recommend you to read the novel as well, though Kubrick nails it so effectively, reading the novel isn't necessary in the slightest for the film to be enjoyed.\r\n\r\nOne of the many 'gamechanger' films of Kubrick's storied and remarkable career.", "Some great visuals and direction not to mention an incredible performance from Malcolm McDowell, I wasn't totally into this, the first half especially was taxing to get through to the point I stopped watching and only finished a couple days later. The rest was good and found myself a bit more engaged however as a whole, this one never grabbed me. **3.5/5**", "With this film, a world heritage of cinema, Stanley Kubrick has reached a level of artistic mastery that would make Michelangelo pale in comparison. To make a film an art form, it must have the innovation of a Chaplin or Jean-Luc Godard. Furthermore, for a film to be a masterpiece, it must have music, direction, and great performances by the cast. Nevertheless, this film easily fulfills these requirements, and miraculously, it is a perfect work of art, with outstandingly high quality visual beauty far above the audience. For 136 minutes, one feels as if one has stepped into an exhibition of paintings or photographs that are sigh-inducingly vivid, beautiful, sometimes violent, and sometimes insane. The film's elaborate camerawork is erotic, but not vulgar, like a sensual film. The clarity of vision, both pictorial and photographic, is unparalleled. Any of the scenes, even the still ones, would make a grade-A photo book. Without a doubt, it is the best film made in the entire world in 1971. It deserves to be the \"Piet\u00e0\" of the film world.", "This is a truly challenging film that routinely glorifies violence - especially towards women, and offers us a terrifying appraisal of the effects of unfettered government and science working in cahoots with each other. Fifty years on from it's groundbreaking release, it's great to watch this on a big screen again - and though the imagery is much less potent that it was in 1971, the performance from Malcolm McDowell is scarily compelling. The plot centres around him and his three sadistic cohorts who live a disparate life terrorising wherever they roam until finally they go a little too far and he is apprehended. A fourteen year sentence is handed down but after two of them, he seeks enrolment in a controversial, experimental, aversion therapy scheme the results of which don't quite deliver as expected. The film presents us with some some pretty gruesome worst-case scenarios to start with, those serve to exaggerate the threat to normal livelihoods and thus lend credibility to the even more daunting prospect of the clinical conditioning of people. In this case, it is specifically the conditioning of one violent individual, but it's very easy to extend the principle to those with whom the government, or state, might disagree - and Kubrick lays that threat bare for all to see and evaluate. I struggled a bit with the nonsense language at times, it seemed puerile and prone to ridicule, certainly to detract from, the more thought-provoking elements of the plot. Perhaps it is there to serve as steam-valve for the intensity of the subject matter, but I am not convinced it is effective or necessary. The book allows us scope to use our own imagination as to the terror this whole concept could invoke, but as film adaptations go, this one offers us a great and innovative template for any interpretation, and coupled with the powerful use of a classical music score - including Ludwig Van, of course, and a solid supporting cast contributing well, this is a truly momentous piece of cinema.", "The film is based on Anthony Burgess\u2018 novel about young Alex Delarge and his droogs who go around tolchocking people and partaking of the ultraviolence and the old in-out-in-out.\r\n\r\nYes, the language is a futuristic mix of Russian, slang and made-up words that Burgess employed so that the futuristic language employed would never sound dated. He called it Nadsat. By the end of the film, for better or worse, you will understand the language.\r\n\r\n**Note: This may be too detailed for those who have not seen the film, so I advise reading it after a viewing.**\r\n\r\nAlex likes violence, sex, and Beethoven. He is the leader of a gang (droogs) and in the first part of the film we witness a typical evening: beating up an old veck (derelict, tramp); breaking into the house of a writer and beating him up and forcing him to witness the rape of his wife (in the book it is this writer who coins the term \u201cA Clockwork Orange\u201d), then heading back to the Korova Milkbar.\r\n\r\nWe are shown Alex\u2019s home: his parents are a rather dull and passive pair. Alex\u2019s bedroom has all the mod-cons, including a pet snake! He also has a state-of-the-art hi-fi on which he listens to his favourite piece of music \u2013 Beethoven\u2019s Ninth.\r\n\r\nThere is dissent in his group\u2019s ranks, to which Alex reacts with violence. However, having asserted his leadership Alex and his droogs go on another evening\u2019s rampage. Alex kills a woman in her house, but is locked in by his vindictive droogs. He is caught and sentenced to 14 years. Two years later, the current Government has promised to do something about the gross prison overcrowding so they employ a new technique that makes the offender feel ill when confronted with violent feelings (the Ludivico Technique). Alex volunteers for the treatment because he will get released after two weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter the two weeks of receiving the treatment we witness a debasing example of its efficacy conducted in front of his old prison warders and chaplain \u2013 who is opposed to the treatment on the grounds that it removes people\u2019s free will. Alex is released.\r\n\r\nGoing home he finds his belongings have been reclaimed by the state, his snake is dead, and his room has been let to a lodger on two-year\u2019s contract. Homeless and with no belongings he meets two of his old droogs who effect their revenge on him. Bloodied, he stumbles across a house and is taken in by the very writer whose wife he raped \u2013 and who has since died, attributed by the writer to the rape. Not recognising Alex at first (because they wore masks) he eventually realises who he has taken in and conspires to exact his revenge and at the same time, with the help of his friends, provide ammunition for those who oppose the Government\u2019s scientific methods of rehabilitating prisoners.\r\n\r\nStripped of his ability to defend himself, Alex now has become a victim.\r\n\r\nThat Alex survives this is no surprise to viewers, considering he is narrating the story; having been nearly killed by his previous victim, the Government has to take action to enforce damage limitation \u2013 Alex\u2019s treatment must be reversed. His ability to enjoy violence must be restored.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to view this film in the present day and understand what caused such furore on its original release. There is brutality and rape, but I have seen far worse in mainstream films and by modern standards these scenes are quite tame \u2013 and when looked at in the cold light of day there is more suggestion than depiction. I suppose the fact this film is now available on DVD indicates a shift in what is regarded as \u201cacceptable\u201d.\r\n\r\nAs with all of Stanley Kubrick\u2018s films, it is a carefully engineered story, the music a mixture of \u201cfuturistic\u201d synthesiser courtesy of Walter Carlos (now Wendy Carlos, yes, he had a sex-change) and classical music and \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d \u2013 the song Alex sings while the writer\u2019s wife is raped.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-made film, full of satire and messages about the free-will of people versus the rights of others to be protected; about how far the state should go to rehabilitate, questions about is it even rehabilitation, and the religious arguments stirred up concerning the removal of one\u2019s free will.\r\n\r\nThere is satire on political machinations and expediency and the love-hate relationship between the press and those in power, how the press can be a weapon against the Government, and its ally. There is a swipe at the fervent belief that God will always provide the answers provided we are patient and wait.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a sideswipe at man\u2019s insistence that Science offers the answer to all things, perhaps the main thrust of the book, and that which gives it its title: \u201c \u2013 The attempt to impose upon man, a creature of growth and capable of sweetness, to ooze juicily at the last round the bearded lips of God, to attempt to impose, I say, laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation, against this I raise my sword-pen \u2014.\u201c\r\n\r\nI recommend the film."], ["**Ponderous, meandering epic with a few bright spots.**\r\n\r\nThis film is about a soldiers quest to find a renegade and insane Colonel (a bald Brando in an extended cameo)  who has hidden himself away in the depths of the jungle and is causing all manner of commotion.

His haunting commentary is one of the most effective narrations in cinematic history and hooks the viewer into the nightmare-adventure.\r\n\r\nI could go on and on about the noteworthy scenes, but I'll resist, except to comment on Col.

General Corman informs Willard: \"He's out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops.\" And, yet, Kurtz was accomplishing what the US military couldn't or wouldn't do because of political complications and niceties. I bring this up because, as I've aged, I've come to see that I'M Kurtz in some ways -- operating \"out there\" beyond the parameters and restrictions typically linked to my work.\r\n\r\nThe script was written by John Milius with alterations by Coppola as he shot the film whilst the narration was written by Michael Herr. The meaning of the story is obvious: The trip up the river led by Capt. Willard exposes him to two extreme viewpoints of war represented by the two colonels he encounters on his long journey, both of whose names start with 'K,' which is no accident:\r\n\r\nLt. COL. KILGORE (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it, i.e. glorifies it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he \"loves the smell of napalm in the morning.\" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war. \r\n\r\nCOL. KURTZ (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's living horror and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard. The existential Kurtz becomes increasingly disillusioned -- even crazy -- after jumping ship from the system and now has no sanctuary. Death is the only way out. His consolation is that Willard will tell his son the truth. \r\n\r\nThe \"Redux\" version was put together by Coppola and released in 2001 with the addition of 49 minutes of material that he originally cut, not to mention placing Clean's surfing scene later in the story.\r\n\r\nCoppola made the right decisions with his original 1979 edit of the film (2 hours, 33 minutes) since the extra footage of \"Redux\" tends to drag the film down with 1 or 2 scenes being dubiously scripted, e.g. the theft of Kilgore's surf board. Not every idea that is birthed during the creative process is worthy of the final product and \"Redux\" illustrates this. Thus the new footage of \"Redux\" should've arguably been relegated to the \"deleted scenes\" section.\r\n\r\nThat said, I've warmed up to \"Redux\" and feel it's a worthy version of the film, but only _if_ you've watched the Theatrical Cut and **want more**. \"Redux\" successfully fleshes out the characters and gives them more dimension, especially Willard and Kurtz. Plus the sequence involving Kurtz reading a couple of TIME magazine articles illustrates beyond any shadow of doubt that he _wasn't_ insane and that the brass simply slandered him as crazy in order to justify the assassination of a decorated American officer.\r\n\r\nCoppola's preferred cut of the film is the \"Final Cut,\" released in 2019, which runs a half hour longer than the Theatrical Cut. In other words, it trims the fat off of \"Redux.\" There's also a \"First Assembly\" version, a bootleg, that runs 4 hours, 49 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A+", "It wasn't just insanity and murder, there was enough of that to go around for everyone.\r\n\r\nApocalypse Now is directed by Francis Ford Coppola who also co-adapts the screenplay with John Milius from Heart of Darkness written by Joseph Conrad. It stars Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms and Albert Hall. Cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro and the music is primarily arranged by Carmine Coppola.\r\n\r\nThe Vietnam War and Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen) is approached by American intelligence to go on a secret assignment: he's to follow the Nung River into the remote Cambodian jungle to find and assassinate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a member of the US Army Special Forces who has gone insane.\r\n\r\nOne of the most talked and written about films of all time, Apocalypse Now remains to this day a harrowing and haunting experience to first time viewers. With a production shoot that has in itself become legendary, Coppola's flawed masterpiece has been dissected and argued over to within an inch of its magnificent life. People will continue to write about it for ever more it seems, perhaps there might even be the odd new confrontational spin on what resides within? But ultimately it's what the individual takes away from the film that matters, our own interpretations key to the enjoyment of such a disturbing vision of war and violence.\r\n\r\nMany of the set-pieces, dialogue and characters have long since passed into folklore, and rightly so. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter assault, Kurtz's surreal death camp, the boat people massacre, purple haze, the playmates, Kilgore, and of course the horror, the horror..indeed. The performances match the quality of Storaro's sumptuous Philippines photography, Sheen is fiercely committed and Duvall and Hopper in turn are powerhouse and edgy. While Brando, doing his own bizzaro thing in the last third, brings a little chaos unintentionally in keeping with the madness at the heart of this particular darkness.\r\n\r\nPersonally that last draggy third does stop it from being a complete genius type whole, but everything up to it is so damn good it's arguably churlish to expect perfection? But as near perfection movies go, Apocalypse Now proudly sits with the best of them, sitting there with a harrowed look upon its face. 9/10", "This is, I think, the definitive Vietnam war movie. Martin Sheen is \"Capt. Willard\", a war weary veteran who is sent on a top secret mission to track down and stop the rogue Colonel 'Kurtz\" (Marlon Brando) who is operating independently from Cambodia. With only a small crew of rookie squaddies, he sets off along the treacherous Nung River where, along the way, they alight on \"Kilgore\" (Robert Duvall) and face all sorts of dangers against both man and nature as they seek their quarry. The sheer intensity of the journey, and of the challenges it throws up cause \"Willard\" to re-evaluate his whole perspective, and not just on the war, as the horrors of this conflict manifest before him. It's a stunningly strong depiction of war; the humanity and vulnerability of the characters - even those who are outwardly strong - and the casting is inspired. It's bloody and gory at times, but never gratuitously and the closely shorn Brando is in a class of his own as the megalomaniac \"Kurtz\". Though fictional in fact, it doesn't pull it's punches and leaves us all with a bitter taste in our mouth and some seriously thought-provoking questions."], ["This is not quite Bantha fodder.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from the freshness of Star Wars (1977) and the all round greatness of craft and story telling that was The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi was always going to struggle in comparison. That's not to say there are not fans who prefer it of the original trilogy, because there are many, and like minded fans of George Lucas' space saga shouldn't have a problem with that.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is the weakest of the three. The characters we have come to love, and to be a part of their universe, are performed with gusto - but they are mostly thinly written, reduced to playing second fiddle to special effects, while the dark heart has been replaced with - well - smokey hokey (furry teddy bears with sticks and stones, I ask you). Then there's the lack of sexual tension so evident in the previous two films. Oh we love Han and Leia because that's love! But one can't help missing the sparks that was once between them - and Luke of course, hmm...\r\n\r\nYet for all that, of the irks and complaints, Return of the Jedi is still a thrilling film, the budget up on the screen to entertain the children and the adults with the child within. Characters and creatures wander into this wonderful world for super impact. The Emperor, Jabba the scene stealer, Rancor and Sarlaac, while the speeder bike chase, further lightsaber shenanigans and the space battle ensure the action is never far away - even if one can be a little underwhelmed by the big finale not all it can be.\r\n\r\nUltimately it was not without faults, but still it was one hell of a conclusion to a genre defining (then) trilogy. 8/10", "_**Fun, cute, imaginative, iconic space adventure with a kick-axx cast**_\r\n\r\n\"Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi\" (1983) was the anticipated end of the original trilogy that began with the initial blockbuster from 1977. The trilogy is an epic, but simplistic space fantasy about an evil empire and the noble souls who dare to fight it. The main cast features Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Ian McDiarmid (Emperor) and the voice work of James Earl Jones (Darth Vader) and  Frank Oz (Yoda).\r\n\r\nThis is an amusing, inventive, iconic space adventure with a stellar cast that upped the ante with edgy cuteness. While I prefer the adult-oriented space science-fiction of Star Trek, I can\u2019t deny that the space fantasy of Star Wars always grants you an entertaining couple hours. \r\n\r\nThis one features lots of sci-fi action, cartoonish characters, great sets, Carrie Fisher at her fittest in an alluring costume, space ships, alien bogs and awesome forest sets (shot in the Redwoods of Northern Cal). Ford and Williams are at their charismatic best. Even the more obscure Hamill shines as the boyish hero and the Darth Vader story arc is notable. Then there\u2019s RD-D2, C-3PO and Chewbacca.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "Arguably the weakest (comparably) of the original trilogy, yet <em>'Return of the Jedi'</em> is still an excellent film!\r\n\r\nMark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher remain a thoroughly enjoyable trio. I did find parts of the plot a little similar to 1977's <em>'Star Wars'</em>, due to the Death Star stuff, but overall I unquestionably enjoyed the 135 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe score is great again, while the new bunch of characters are cool. There are some memorable moments in there, as we see the first spate of films come to a close very nicely. I'm very intrigued to see where things go with the prequels, hopefully they continue to hit high marks.", "This third of the original Star Wars films is probably my weakest. Possibly because the writing is not too tight but for me, more so because the \"Ewoks\" take over the thing and they are just stupidly annoying. What had potential to pitch the ultimate evil partnership against the Rebel Alliance became a toy-fight straight out of a Laurel and Hardy comedy - the storyline was infantile. Still it\u2019s a great film to look at, and features just enough menace and diversion in the first hour to make it worth watching until an ending that I found the ultimate in disappointment!"], ["In a world that's powered by violence, on the streets where the violent have power, a new generation carries on an old tradition.\r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s Goodfellas is without question one of the finest gangster movies ever made, a benchmark even. It\u2019s that rare occasion for a genre film of this type where everything artistically comes together as one. Direction, script, editing, photography, driving soundtrack and crucially an ensemble cast firing on all cylinders. It\u2019s grade \u201cA\u201d film making that marked a return to form for Scorsese whilst simultaneously showing the director at the summit of his directing abilities.\r\n\r\nThe story itself, based on Nicholas Pileggi\u2019s non-fiction book Wiseguy, pulls absolutely no punches in its stark realisation of the Mafia lifestyle. It\u2019s often brutal, yet funny, unflinching yet stylish, but ultimately from first frame to last it holds the attention, toying with all the human emotions during the journey, tingling the senses of those who were by 1990 fed up of popcorn movie fodder. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not romanticism here, if anything it\u2019s a debunking of the Mafia myth, but even as the blood flows and the dialogue crackles with electricity, it always remains icy cool, brought to us by a man who had is eyes and ears open while growing up in Queens, New York in the 40s and 50s. Eccellente! 9/10", "Martin Scorsese (director) always loves details in crime films, but he is not primarily interested in the crime itself. That is why his films are always produced with details that you may see as unimportant to you, especially if you want to see the movie for the purpose of seeing scenes of theft, murder, and so on, but you see the opposite. Somewhat other details are visible on the scene mostly\r\n\r\nThe film talks about liberation, stereotypes, and entering a new world for humanity. It was Ray Liotta (Henry). He wanted, as I said, to break free from stereotypes and enter the world of gangs.\r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese (the director) filmed this unfamiliar life and directed it in the form of a film similar to documentaries because he filmed it as if it were a real, realistic life. That is why the presence of Voice Over was important in order to give you the feeling that there is a person sitting next to you telling you the story while whispering in your ear as it happens in the movies documentaries.", "Ray Liotta is superb here as \"Henry Hill\", a man whom ever since he was young has been captivated by the mob. He starts off as a runner and before too long has ingratiated himself with the local fraternity lead by \"Paulie\" (Paul Sorvino) and is best mates with fellow hoods, the enigmatic and devious \"Jimmy\" (Robert De Niro) and the excellently vile \"Tommy\" (Joe Pesci). They put together an audacious robbery at JFK and are soon the talk of the town, but the latter in the trio is a bit of a live-wire and when he goes just a bit too far one night, the three of them find that their really quite idyllic lives of extortion and larceny start to go awry - and it's their own who are on their tracks. Scorsese takes him time with this story: the development of the characters - their personalities, trust, inter-reliance, sometimes divided, fractured, loyalties and ruthlessness and are built up in a thoroughly convincing fashion. We can, ourselves, see the obvious attractions for the young \"Henry\" of a life so very far removed from his working class Irish-Italian background - the wine, the women, the thrills; it's tantalising! If anything let's it down it's the last half hour; it's just a little too predictable and having spent so long building up the characters, we seem to be in just a bit too much of a rush; but that is a nit-pick. It's not the \"Godfather\" but it is not far short."], ["Described by Roger Ebert as a \"trapped in a haunted house\" movie, this movie set the bar for Horror in the Summer. \r\n\r\nThe \"Nostromo,\" like \"Star Wars\" spacecraft, looks worn and in use, compared to the \"just out of the box\" look of \"Star Trek\" spacecraft. (And I'm a fan of the \"Star Trek\" universe!) The claustrophobic feel of the \"Nostromo\" is due to \"filming inside of a tube\" location shooting next seen in \"Das Boot.\" \r\n\r\nA band of \"space truckers\" are awakened from hibernation, and are shocked to find that they are only half way home. The Company orders them to investigate an Alien transmission, which sets up a descent into Hell as the crew finds themselves being stalked by an opportunistic \"Exomorph.\" As the crew is picked off one by one, the true nature of the beast and the odd attitude of the Science officer, Ash, raise the anxiety level over 100%.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this tale apart from other \"space monster\" films is the character of Third officer Ripley, who raises uncomfortable questions to Capt. Dallas about company policy in general and Science officer Ash in particular. After Capt. Dallas disappears, take-charge-female-Ripley discovers Ash's true intentions and leads her diminished crew to action.\r\n\r\n The level of violence has been described as \"near pornographic,\" which is helped along by H.R. Giger's \"worst nightmare\" mature Alien. This is the first of a memorable franchise, featuring a strong female leader that continues into the \"Prometheus\" prequel.(?)", "There is a clause in the contract which specifically states any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin must be investigated... \r\n\r\nAlien is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon.

Bad idea...\r\n\r\nBack on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a  terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.\r\n\r\nOn plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.\r\n\r\nSome still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid  conventions.\r\n\r\nWith art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.\r\n\r\nIt made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.\r\n\r\nNow 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly show. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10", "The standard bearer of horror in space, Ridley Scott's masterpiece still thrills new generations of fans. The Giger-inspired alien induces a claustrophobic nightmare that still carries on in sequels and prequels.", "<em>'Alien'</em> isn't as eventful, and as such as entertaining, as I had anticipated, though it is still an enjoyable near two hours.\r\n\r\nIt's a strong cast, with newbie Sigourney Weaver putting in a great performance. Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and John Hurt are good too. I wanted to see more of them, though that's normal given the tightness of the setting - there's only so much they can do, of course.\r\n\r\nOther positives include the neat set design, solid special effects and well done tension building. I can't say I was ever fully unnerved, in fairness that's more a personal thing as fiction rarely scares me, but I was locked on for the entirety. It also gets respect for setting the benchmark it did.\r\n\r\nWill check out the sequels, prequels and spin-offs/crossovers with much intrigue.", "Horror in Space, that's what this is. It's a space monster movie, and the thing is, if you see Aliens, or most of the other Alien related films BEFORE you see this one, you're going to be expecting something completely different.\r\n\r\nBut what you have is a horror movie set on a space ship with an atmosphere so thick that you could cut it with a knife.\r\n\r\nYou can taste the eerie tension when you watch it...and, at least in my eyes, that makes it better than the over-the-top Space Marines that you see in the later installments.\r\n\r\nAnd, no questions are answered. There is no broad sweeping mythology. There is only the movie, there is only the monster, there is only the fear and tension. But that is all the movie needs.\r\n\r\nIt's just science-fiction and scary. It's a brilliant merger.\r\n\r\nBut, don't listen to the people making it out to be more than it is. It's really ONLY a horror movie in space and nothing more. That doesn't make it any less enjoyable, but it does make it completely confusing when you read reviews that make it out to be more than an exceptional monster movie.", "**One of the great founders of modern sci-fi.**\r\n\r\nAnyone who knows me already knows that I don't really like alien-themed movies, because I don't strictly believe in intelligent life outside our planet. However, the theme has already yielded many quality horror or thriller films. \u201cAlien\u201d is arguably the best, best-performed, and most enshrined and culturally significant of them all. It's one of those films that has already gone beyond cinematic issues to become a piece of art and culture that we all know, even people who never took the time to see it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not worth wasting time explaining the plot around the \u201cNostromo\u201d, a cargo ship with seven crew members who are decimated by a highly dangerous and carnivorous alien. The direction, in charge of Ridley Scott, is excellent, meticulous, attentive, and the story is intelligent, very well written and with well-developed and used characters. Contrary to what happens in other films, we see the characters trying to act as a team, and trying to solve an unexpected and dangerous situation. I never felt like they were acting in such a way as to almost purposefully put themselves in danger, which happens a lot in recent horror movies.\r\n\r\nSigourney Weaver made an excellent dramatic career after this film, which established her as an actress and opened doors for her in the industry. A deserved reward, given that she puts in her best efforts and gives this character all the resilience, humanity and charisma she deserves and needs. Despite the general quality of the cast being quite good, there are almost no actors capable of matching Weaver. As far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film has excellent cinematography (it even looks newer than it is) and really good special effects and visuals, considering that there is no CGI and that everything is done in the old-fashioned way. Finally, a word of praise for the iconic original score composed by Jerry Goldsmith.", "Back in the day before Sir John Hurt took to being little more than a highly paid cameo-man, he was a great actor and here is a prime example. His merchant ship is travelling through space when it receives a distress call. They stop to help and one of their number becomes infected with a... well, now you have to watch it. Sigourney Weaver is superb as the feisty, no-nonsense \"Ripley\" who leads the defence against a beastie that has brute strength, determination, intelligence and an astonishing ability to move at speed through the corridors and conduits of the ship. Ridley Scott allows the tension to rise gently and violently, by degree, and the clever use of sound and light; Jerry Goldsmith's tense score and excellent supporting performances from Tom Skerritt and a wonderfully seedy ian Holm make this a seminal sci-fi horror film that still makes you want to hide behind the sofa - 40 years on!", "The baby xenomorph looks like a muppet.", "A masterpiece!\r\n\r\nCan be rewatched indefinitely!"], ["My name is Ash and I am a slave.

It is marketed as a horror film, but there is absolutely zero tension or spooks to be had in its entire runtime, luckily the movie was actually quite funny. Raimi tried to do a bit too much in the special effects department, leaving many of the effects feel cheap and out of place. The green screen technology especially just was not there for the time. Raimi's direction was very relevant, and his signature touch on the film really helped. The performances and writing absolutely save the film. Bruce Campbell is the best he's ever been, with incredible line delivery that had be legitimately laughing out loud. The quick witty dialogue between characters was hilarious.

I generally like to start the franchises in the right order. However, and as far as I was reading, this film is the one that most differs from the antecedents, not least because the action takes place in the medieval period, and revolves around the possession of a book, the legendary Necronomicon.\r\n\r\nContrary to what one might think, the Necronomicon was not an invention of Sam Raimi, or any of the elements in the film. The book was created by the writer H. P. Lovecraft, and the idea came to be used for the film. Raimi is a creative and original director, and it's not surprising that such a bizarre film came out of his head. Basically, what we have here is a simple warehouse employee who, after handling the book, is teleported to the year 1300. And of course, to return to our time, he will have to find the book there, and overcome dangers of various order, starting with the medieval nobles themselves, at war with each other.\r\n\r\nBruce Campbell is the only actor who deserves mention in this cast of vast names in which there is no one who stands out positively.

And even Campbell is so irritating and arrogant that I didn't sympathize with his character at all, even though I know he's the hero and will somehow end up saving the day.\r\n\r\nThe film is corny, it's quite cheap (we only need to look at the poor quality of the stop-motion animations and visual or special effects to see that) and it's so absurd that it's hilarious.

While they\u2019re both good, \u201cPsycho\u201d is way superior. It was followed by three sequels (1983, 1986 and 1990), the last being a semi-prequel, all starring Anthony Perkins as Norman with Vera Miles returning for the first one.\r\n\r\nOne thing I don\u2019t like is that it was shot in B&W. Check out the sequels and the 1998 remake to observe the same settings in living color.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes and was shot primarily at the backlot of Universal Studios, Universal City, California, with other parts in Los Angeles & Gorman, California, and Phoenix, Arizona. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A", "My most favourite film from the master of suspense.\r\n\r\nThis psychological horror is widely considered to be the first ever slasher film. Powered by great performances from Anthony Perkins & Janet Leigh, and the outstanding score by Bernard Herrmann which adds such great tension throughout the film, it is unarguably the greatest thriller ever made. Only Alfred Hitchcock could make a film so entertaining and so horrifying at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe climax continues to haunt me forever.", "Amazingly, this is my first ever viewing, not sure why I waited so long, but finally got around to it. Great movie in every way from the performance by Anthony Perkins to the atmosphere, enjoyed every bit of this even though I basically knew the entire plot at this point since all iconic scenes and lines have been repeated over the years. Not sure this is my *favorite* Hitchcock movie as I still prefer Rear Window, but obvious why it has held up 60 years later. **4.5/5**", "There is so much more to this film than just that famous scene in the shower - and so much of it belongs to the marvellous scoring of Bernard Herrmann. His ability to use those screeching strings, and the pace of his music does so much of the heavy lifting that gives this film a sense of accumulating menace that makes it still, after over 60 years, a masterful piece of cinema. Janet Leigh wants to make a go of things with her cash-strapped hunky boyfriend \"Sam\" (John Gavin) so when an unexpected opportunity arises at work that puts $40,000 in her lap, she skips town and takes refuge during a thunderstorm at the \"Bates\" motel where she encounters \"Norman\" (a very handsome looking Anthony Perkins). The rest you will just have to watch for yourself, but the story has just about everything you could want from a thriller: a fella with a bit of a \"mummy\" syndrome; some good old fashioned larceny; lust and though I didn't quite love the ending, it is a superbly dramatic piece of well considered and constructed cinema that cleverly builds on what is quite a simple story with a strong and convincing cast. Big screen if you can; that house on the hill looks more eery that way. Great stuff!"], ["'We're on a mission from God.'\r\n\u2014 \"Joliet\" Jake and Elwood Blues\r\n\r\n(Laughs) ...\r\n\r\nWhat a magnificent work of motion picture art The Blues Brothers is! This fun-filled musical is truly a must-see. The screenplay was co-written by Saturday Night Live alum Dan Aykroyd, whom, by the way also stars in the effort as Elwood Blues, one half of the Chicago-based R&B/Blues band, The Blues Brothers. Native Chicagoan and Aykroyd's fellow SNL grad, John Belushi (The late, great), also stars in this zany opus as \"Joliet\" Jake, Elwood's biological other half. And with an all-star supporting cast that includes the likes of Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Cab (Minnie the Moocher) Calloway, John Lee Hooker, and Carrie Fisher, among quite a few others, The Blues Brothers is one tremendous cinematic force - in both the Musical film and Action film genres, respectively.\r\n\r\nJohn Landis, who co-wrote the screenplay with Aykroyd, also directs the high-leveled ensemble.\r\n\r\nIn this feel-good tale, the plot revolves around the threatened foreclosure of a Catholic orphanage in which the two brothers were raised. The city has placed an unlawful detainer on the orphanage, and if members of its clergy fail to raise $5,000, the amount needed to stay the pending foreclosure, then it's eviction time for all of those needy children who still call the institution home. But before \"Joliet\" Jake and Elwood Blues see that happen, they'll tear a whole lotta Chicago up!\r\n\r\nWith that, the crazy and over-the-top hilarious action begins ... And \"laughing out loud\" will truly be an understatement.\r\n\r\nSet in the Windy City, The Blues Brothers is jam-packed with action, adventure, great music, comedy, and deep, heartstrings-tugging emotion. It does its part in helping to define what a genuinely great and entertaining movie should be. And it is a CLASSIC in every sense of the adjective.\r\n\r\nMy big brother (God love him) introduced me to this film, by way of a movie date, over three decades ago. And to this day, I continue to harbor for both him and it, a love beyond passion. Five stars!", "OK, the title here is probably disingenuous. I live in Chicago, a city that doesn't allow you residence unless it can confirm that you love \"The Blues Brothers\" and \"The Untouchables.\" So this review is coming with a fair amount of cultural bias out the door. So I'm just going to drop the honest part right now and tell you flatly that this is bias. It's likely the most bias review that you'll probably ever read.\r\n\r\nFranklin singing in a famous Maxwell street diner (now defunct) but still, that's pretty Chicago right there.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, if you've ever lived by the L you get the joke about the trains running past you every couple of minutes at a deafening pitch.\r\n\r\nAnd there's the fact that I grew up in McHenry County when it was still a rural country podunk county and they still gave us the nod.\r\n\r\nIt's all Chicago, and it's all Chicago with a line up of Blues cameo's that the world has never seen before and sadly will never see again, especially as the genre has faded to near obscurity with the generations after X.\r\n\r\nThere's something splendid about it. It's a comedy that has never stopped reminding me of home. I can even sit down with my wife and watch this movie in our Chicago apartment and feel a nostalgia for the Chicago that used to be, for the Maxwell Street that used to be, and I can watch it when I'm out far from home and it acts as kind of a comfort piece.\r\n\r\nAnd, what I've found out in my life is that the love for it is international, or at least The Blues Brothers transcended borders and has a faithful following in Germany as well.\r\n\r\nIt's a movie about The Blues and about Chicago, and don't listen to the nay sayers, even our home town boy Buddy Guy will tell you that the Blues aren't an exclusively Black thing, it's not an exclusively an American thing, they are an exclusively music thing. There is a reason, after all, why people say that they \"appreciate\" the Blues. And I don't think anyone is in a position to argue with Buddy Guy about this.\r\n\r\nSo take this however you want. It's a funny musical with better music than musicals tend to have... or it's a beloved tradition that comes with your zip code. Either way it's something that only the most jaded and cynical among us won't enjoy and love.", "**Remarkable.**\r\n\r\nJohn Landis was inspired when he decided to direct a film like this one. In addition to bringing us the excellent music that integrates the soundtrack, it brings us high doses of very good humor and a captivating, intelligent and well-written story, based on the desire of two brothers to reunite their former R&B band, dissolved after them getting into trouble with the police, and using music to raise the money needed to maintain the Catholic orphanage where they grew up. It's a plot that seems subscribed, but considering that it's a comic and quite unpretentious film, it seems within a very acceptable level.\r\n\r\nThe cast is simply outstanding and is full of famous names. Each one of them does the best they can, and the result of it all, combined, is truly positive. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd manage the two main characters with panache and enormous talent, in a way that it's really hard not to dedicate all your attention to them when they appear on the scene. I really liked the absolutely serious way they say the jokes. We can't guess what will come out of their mouths. Carrie Fisher also appears here, in a smaller but quality work. And we need to highlight the enormous contributions of a wide range of immortal names in music, such as Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin and James Brown. Until near the end of the film, I really thought that the actors were very similar to them, but no.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, it's a film that looks more understated than it actually is. There's a lot of money invested there, and we can see that in the special effects and the staggering amount of cars and things that are destroyed throughout the film, as the Blues Brothers leave their trail of chaos in their wake. I got to the point of thinking that the Portuguese police would be happy if they had half the cars destroyed in the film! I also got the impression that shooting outdoors, especially in an urban environment, needed to interrupt normal traffic on the streets, which is expensive. Well, I've already mentioned the soundtrack, but it's worth stressing this point again: the film has excellent music and songs, and Jazz, Blues, R&B and Soul lovers will probably love this."], ["This is by far the greatest movie of all time!  Even better than the first Godfather!", "Worthy sequel to the first movie. In something more meditative and unhurried, in something more philosophically meaningful than its legendary predecessor. Backstage games and backstage talks replaced the dramatic mood swings of the main characters and the exchange of fire.\r\n\r\nThe second film continues the story of Michael Carleone in the role of the Godfather, and also complements the family story with scenes of the formation of the young Vito Andolini and his escape to America. The difficult choice of being young Don, his sphere of expansion of influence opens up new heights and horizons, but also acquires new enemies. Big money and power always keep pace with great temptation, and therefore you should always keep your ears open. After all, the knife in the back can insert exactly the one from whom you do not expect ...", "Building on the first volume, this self-adaptation by writer Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola develops the story of the new Don - \"Michael\" (Al Pacino). His attempts to expand, and to a certain extent legitimise, the family businesses see him associating with the duplicitous \"Hyman Roth\" (Lee Strasberg) in Cuba; subject to betrayal, assassination attempts and fighting what may be a losing battle to keep his own family together - all whilst doing plenty of Machiavellian manipulation of his own. There is an equally strong parallel thread depicting how his father \"Vito\" (Robert de Niro) rose to prominence after fleeing Sicily after the murder of his family at the hands of \"Don Ciccio\". With the principal characters all now well established, we can hit the ground running with a solid and complex set of inter-connected, character-driven storylines. The superior cast deliver this story really effectively - Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton as the consigliere and wife respectively, standing out. The attention to detail alongside the instantly recognisable Nino Rota score add amply to what is just a great story of Michael's efforts to build upon (and honour) his father's legacy, before he loses all of his own, once prevailing, decency. It is long, and it does miss Brando, but Pacino is on super form as the increasingly ruthless and isolated - even lonely - figure and I reckon this is every bit as good at the \"Godfather\" (1972).", "This Hollywood style formula movie about mobsters isn't as pathetic as the first or third one, simply because it is too dull and poorly directed to stay awake through.\r\nIt's basically just a bunch of scenes of people \"talking tough\" or getting killed, with no point.\r\nIf you're looking for a plot or story, forget it. There is none. It's a muddled mess. It appears that by the end, the chief mobster is in anguish over whether or not to kill his brother. \r\nWhy? Who knows? None of this makes sense to those of us who aren't born with some super psychic ESP. \r\nIt also appears there's some revenge, but we never know why, or who, or what. It's just a poorly directed and poorly written mess.\r\nIt does cure Insomnia, though, which is why it gets a 2 rating instead of a 1."], ["**The second half is better than the first half.**\r\n\r\nA film of two halves. \r\n\r\nThe first half of the fiim focuses on the training of raw recruits and features shenanigans we have seen countless times before - think _Stripes_ and _Police Academy_.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the fat guy - a scenario we had already witnessed in Stripes and Police Academy ( \"_I could show a movie on your butt, fatso_!\"- Lt Harris, Police Academy) is here played out to maximum effect. The fat guy who freezes atop a climbing frame is the central plot here with Matthew Modine's character playing second fiddle to all of the _Leslie Barbara_ stuff.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the movie at least gives us something we were not expecting when a sniper's identity is revealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Ian Beale", "Released in 1986, <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> is Stanley Kubrick's film about Vietnam, adapted from a novel by the reclusive and bitter Vietnam veteran Gustav Harford, and then further expanded by acclaimed Vietnam journalist Michael Herr.\r\n\r\nThe film breaks down neatly into two very different parts, though both are seen through the eyes of young United States marine J. T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine). In the first act, Davis makes his way through Marine basic training with a motley group of other recruits under the hellish command of gunnery sergeant Hartmann (R. Lee Ermey). Joker watches as Hartmann bullies an overweight and dim-witted recruit cruelly nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), until Pyle explodes into murderous revenge. In the second act, now set in Vietnam where Joker is doing a tour of duty as a military journalist, the protagonist and his fellow Marines find themselves on the front line during the Tet Offensive and Joker witnesses firsthand the savagery of war.\r\n\r\nFew films consist of such drastically opposed parts that differ in setting and tone and don\u2019t have any overlapping characters besides the protagonist (and one minor character from the boot camp scenes). <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> has often disappointed viewers because the first half is so thrilling that it proves a hard act to follow. That's all down to R.&nbsp;Lee Ermey, who actually was a drill instructor during Vietnam and initially served only as a technical consultant before Kubrick decided to let him play the role and improvise. Ermey acts with a white-hot intensity, realism, and brilliantly worded insults and obscenities that no screenwriter could ever have come up with.\r\n\r\nAs a young man, I too felt that the film was a letdown once it moved past the witty quips and goofy camaraderie of the boot camp scenes. With time, however, my appreciation for the film as a whole has only grown. The two-part structure now seems to be a strong yin-yang structure: the first act is a vision of order, while the second is all chaos. Furthermore, the second half is a moving statement of how war is often senseless. Joker and his squad, while on patrol for an enemy they cannot even identify and whose ideology or culture they know hardly anything of, begin to be targeted by a sniper. Several men perish before the sniper is found and neutralized, and all that death is pointless: it doesn't contribute in any way to victory for either side. The brutality of World War I trench warfare, where dozens of men could perish for merely a foot of conquered ground, is shown to have persisted through the American quagmire in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nThat said, the film does have its flaws. One is the unrealistic depiction of the Vietnamese landscape. Kubrick had a great fear or dislike of foreign travel, and he insisted on shooting the whole film in East London. Having merely a few palm trees shipped in is a poor replacement for a real Southeast Asian shooting location with its humidity and insects, and in the scene that is meant to show a lively Vietnamese town square Kubrick obviously had the same few cars driving around in circles. It's strange how a director who was generally so perfectionist, could be so careless about locales (this only got worse with his next and last film, <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, with its inauthentic stage set New York City). There are also some anachronisms that this director and his technical advisors should have noticed.\r\n\r\nStill, even a flawed Kubrick film is classic cinema.", "The Marine's don't want robots - they want killers.\r\n\r\nThis is the journey undertaken by Private \"Joker\" J.T. Davis, from brutal training camp to Vietnam itself.\r\n\r\nAs most people know by now, Full Metal Jacket is divided very much into two different halves, halves that to me show the best and worst of the talented director, Stanley Kubrick. For the first part we are subjected to the training regime inflicted on wet behind the ears boys, boys soon to become Marines out in the harshness of the Vietnam War. This is real dehumanising stuff, frighteningly essayed by the brilliance of drill instructor R Lee Ermey's performance. We know, see and feel that the boys are primed to be killing machines, unemotional killing machines at that, with Kubrick astutely weaving the brutality of camp into the moral quandary that was the war itself. One particular recruit, Private Gomer (a heartfelt and unnervingly great Vincent D'Onofrio) is the film, and Gustav Hasford's (writer of the novel and co screenwriter here) point of reference in this incredible first half. It's with this strand that \"Jacket\" burns itself into the soul of the viewer, to hopefully set us up for what will be Private \"Joker's\" (Matthew Modine) preparation for the Vietnam conflict.\r\n\r\nThen it's that second half...\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here? We already know that \"Joker\" and his mentally brutalised colleagues have been stripped of their basic humanity. Soldiers primed to kill, it's harsh, but true. But Kubrick has already chilled our blood and bludgeoned us repeatedly courtesy of the \"Boot Camp\" set up. Modine's (who isn't strong enough to carry the picture) \"Joker\" is now the film's axis, a clever, most definitely articulate character, who is thrust into the murky and muddled battle of the Tet Offensive, yeah and so? All it amounts to is a prolonged series of rationale and philosophical musings on the false war. Kubrick even shifting to safe mode with a clumsy narration segment spouted by \"Joker\".\r\n\r\nFull Metal Jacket is a truly fine film, but it's not the brilliant one it really should have been. If one can take the time to venture deeper with the second half, then it doesn't deliver on the already made point promise of the first part. Technically it's flawless, incredibly designed, with Douglas Milsome's cinematography stunningly effective. But I'll maintain to my final day that Full Metal Jacket finished up as being bloody and pretty instead of being a poignant and horrifying masterpiece. 7/10"], ["We all know that the moon is made of cheese, so when \"Wallace\" and his long-suffering hound \"Gromit\" run short of their precious Wensleydale - and maybe after watching a bit of \"The Mouse on the Moon\" (1963) on the telly - they decide to build a rocket and take themselves to this Elysium of fromage. After a last minute dash to get the cream crackers, off they go and are soon positively rolling in the stuff. Thing is, though, they are not the only occupants and their escapades now really begin. I rarely mention voice credits on animations, as many of us don't get the same people, but the delightfully charismatic comic actor Peter Sallis is inspired casting as the voice of \"Wallace\" and the animation skills of writer Nick Park and the Aardman team make for a really engaging stop-motion story that is amiable and enjoyably paced for twenty minutes of colourful and characterful drama. It's simple, uncomplicated and well worth a watch."], ["28 year old Kenneth Branagh really reached for the stars with **HENRY V**, his cinematic directorial debut.  Quite often, a young director falls on their backside in ones first attempt at making film.  Luckily for us, **Henry V** is nothing short of a triumph.\r\n\r\nBranagh's directorial approach is ambitious and confident.  Filled with high excitement - quite an accomplishment when staging a 400 year old stage play told completely through dialogue.  His visual style certainly are more film than stage play, and his screenplay adaptation tightens the story, even with the inclusion of a scene that was originally from Shakespeare's **HENRY IV Part 2** to clarify the story.\r\n\r\nMore amazing, Branagh also portrays the Young King in a tremendous interpretation of the role.  Not only does his Harry fit organically into the story, his understanding of the language makes the story relatable to today's audiences without destroying the poetry.\r\n\r\nOthers in the regal cast include excellent performances  by Emma Thompson and Derek Jacobi as the omnipresent Chorus.  Many other performers will star in Branagh's later films as he seems to operate in a collaborative community approach.\r\n\r\nThe stunning musical score by Patrick Doyle cements what will become one of the greatest director / composer relationships.  Brash and operatic, the score is as capable of supporting the many battles as well as the intimate romantic scenes.\r\n\r\nObviously, Branagh's **HENRY V** will be compared to Olivier's film - a production that has not aged as well for today's audiences.  Olivier's production is bright and colorful with sets resembling a production of the Wizard of Oz. Branagh's film is gritty and dirty and brings viewer onto the bloody field of Agincourt.\r\n\r\nOn a personal level, Branagh's **HENRY V** was the first film that I watched in its entirety and stayed in my seat and watched it all the way through a second time. It shows that Shakespeare can be vibrant, entertaining and beautiful."], ["_**Lively costume biography about Mozart\u2019s last nine years in Austria**_\r\n\r\nAntonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) is a competent but mediocre composer in Vienna, Austria, in the late 1700s. He recognizes the God-given genius of the younger Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and struggles with bitter envy. The story is told in flashback as Salieri shares it with a cleric decades later at an asylum. \r\n\r\n\u201cAmadeus\u201d (1984) is an entertaining costume drama that successfully takes you back to Vienna from 1783-1791. Mozart was basically the rock star of the era and some of his dynamic music even evokes certain modern rock styles. Giving the main characters personality helps bring the events alive and the flashback structure makes for compelling storytelling. \r\n\r\nOn the feminine front, Elizabeth Berridge plays Amadeus\u2019 cute & feisty wife, Constanze, while Christine Ebersole is on hand as a ravishing opera singer, sorta reminiscent of Tina Root of Switchblade Symphony (albeit taller).   \r\n\r\nThe original Broadway play concentrated on character motivation with music in the background while the movie focuses a little too much on it. Unless you\u2019re an opera aficionado, the extensive scenes of Mozart's and Salieri's operas being performed become tiresome after a while and unnecessarily bloat the film, somewhat muting the story. When the Emperor yawns during a performance of \u201cFigaro\u201d I could relate because a lot of opera music sounds the same to me.\r\n \r\nNonetheless, this is an informative and amusing biography of Wolfgang\u2019s last nine years; very well done. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 40 minutes and was shot mostly in the Czech Republic.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+/A-", "Rarely can I think of a more worthy multi-award winning performance than that from F. Murray Abraham in this masterfully crafted - if entirely speculative - retrospective on the life and times of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (portrayed here by the astonishingly effective Tom Hulce). Abraham portrays the duplicitous, envious and malevolent Antonio Salieri, the court composer to Emperor Joseph II of Austria (Jeffery Jones). He is talented, up to point, and settled in his politically influential and wealthy role, but growing up, he has always been aware of this other young boy who can play, perfectly, composing as he goes. Initially in awe of this man's predigious talent, it isn't long before the green eyed monster starts to rear it's ugly head, and jealousy soon starts to drive his every waking moment. Meantime, the young maestro is attracting more and more attention, acclaim and is soon rivalling Salieri for the attentions of the Emperor himself. At this stage, Salieri must act. How? Well fortunately he is ably assisted by Mozart's own self-destructive character. As a child, compared to a performing monkey, he always had issues with his father (Roy Dotrice) and even when married to Stanzi (Elizabeth Berridge) with his own child, we feel that he is always in search of adulation, appreciation and love whilst treading a very fine line between despair and a chronic fear of poverty and failure - one which leads him to an increasingly addictive existence. What is also striking here, is the extent to which Mozart's music has become pervasive in not just cinema history, but in our broader environment too. I found myself familiar - to varying degrees - with much of the superbly delivered soundtrack. It's all told via a rather apposite \"confession\" between Salieri and a priest who, as the story develops, struggles with his own faith and his belief that all sins can be forgiven. Perhaps some can't? The attention to detail here is fantastic: the sets, costumes and the location photography contribute hugely to the wonderfully rich look and feel of a film that just oozes style and confidence. Hulce's portrayal of the creative virtuoso as he descends into a maelstrom of misery is thoroughly convincing, and by the end - historical fact being adhered to, at least in this - I felt emotionally drained by the strength of these two tours de forces. A big screen with big sound is a must here, and I think you will find the three hours that this lasts will just fly by."], ["This film marked the third reunion between Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro after \u201cMean Streets\u201d and \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d. This time Scorsese invited Paul Schrader (\u2018Taxi Driver\u2019) and Mardik Martin (\u2018Mean Streets\u2019 ) to write the film script that is loosely based on La Motta\u2019s novel. Raging Bull tells the true story based of Jack La Motta a middleweight boxer whose rage, violence and temper made him king of the ring while on the other hand destroying his life slowly. The greatest demon of all we have to fight is actually deep within all of us.", "Impressive Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in a classical Scorsese movie.", "Sorry but I was really unimpressed with this tale of the life of legendary boxer Jake La Motta. It's based on his own book, so it can be relied upon to be authentic, but somehow this Martin Scorsese effort just fell flat for me. The usual mix of Robert De Niro (La Motta) with probably the least versatile actor I have ever seen on screen, Joe Pesci, as his brother Joey; Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie and an ensemble of Italian American co-stars just reminded me of a very much weaker \"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969). Sure, that's not about boxing - but I'm not too sure how much this is about it, either. There is precious little by way of ring action - though what there is is excellently and intensively photographed - for the most part it is more of a soap opera, backed up with loads of expletives and a bit of domestic violence that seems to have come to epitomise the attitudes this New York community have for their womenfolk. There is the usual gangland, fight-fixing, shenanigans but somehow it all comes across as remarkably sterile. I don't really rate De Niro as an actor. Like Pesci, he only really seems to have one gear; one style and it all usually involves him playing well to his own roots, armed with a ripe vocabulary and lots of angry tantrums. At times it is shot like a television movie; the black and white imagery is just too clean and pristine. It seems to be trying for a look that places it contemporaneously in the late 1940s, but instead, for me anyway, it came across more as a film out of it's time. I am certain that I am in the minority here; it played to a very full cinema the other night and received applause at the end, but I am afraid I just cannot see what all the fuss is about.", "**One of Scorsese's best.**\r\n\r\nThis is considered by many to be the best boxing film made to date. And in fact it is a very well made film, where director Martin Scorsese shows all his value as a filmmaker. I don't know if we can say it's his best film, but it's certainly on the top five list.\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around the controversial sporting career of Jake \u201cBull\u201d LaMotta, one of the most famous middleweight boxers of all time. At a time when sport was controlled by criminal mafias and where fights were often a hidden and manipulated betting business, LaMotta managed to succeed and become champion before his career collapsed under accusations of fight manipulation that led to the sanitation of the competitions for several years. The film portrays his journey well, but also dedicates a lot of time to showing us the violent man, coming from very humble origins and where violence is everyday, and who lives in a conflictive marriage due to constant jealousy. A man that very few could like, I dare say, he paid the price for what he experienced and finally understood the true value of violence. In fact, being such a violent film, it is obvious that children and more sensitive people should avoid it.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is simply impeccable. The black-and-white cinematography could not be sharper, more pleasant, clear and well-framed, and the cuts made during post-production work are surgical and made with millimeter precision. With very special care for the sets and costumes, the film makes us travel through time with silky smoothness, from the 40s to the end of the following decade: without being an expert, I can say that I didn't observe any great problems with recreating eras and the sets, costumes and props are of high quality. The effects and makeup are unblemished, transforming the scenes in the ring into authentic massacres that make the real fights look like classical ballet rehearsals.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, but I believe that, along with \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d, it was the film that launched Robert DeNiro's career to a level of maturity that allowed him to become the undisputed star he is today. The actor embraced the character with a commitment and dedication that is truly enviable and worthy of applause. Joe Pesci isn't far behind and does an excellent job as LaMotta's brother. In a more reserved but undoubtedly suffering role, Cathy Moriarty is very good, and we still have some room to see the elegant work of Frank Vincent or Nicholas Colasanto."], ["**Overall, it's a good movie about the start of the space race.**\r\n\r\nThe space race was one of the aspects that marked the intense rivalry between the USA and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. There was the notion that space could be a battleground or a zone of influence, as colonial territories had been decades before, and that the nuclear threat made it urgent to dominate space. That's why the Mercury Program was born, responsible for the first suborbital and orbital flights carried out by the USA.\r\n\r\nDirected by Philip Kaufman, the film is very good and very well made, even if, at times, it resembles an expensive advertisement for NASA and what was done by the North Americans in the space race. It is a long film, with three hours, but that is justified by covering a large period of time and giving us a very global view of the Mercury missions. This leads me to another problem: you need to have a minimal knowledge of the program and who was part of it to be able to understand everything the film shows, because there are not many explanations and the film presumes that the audience knows what they are watching.\r\n\r\nThe cast is, perhaps, one of the most important aspects of the film, since it is largely based on the development of the characters and on the way each actor worked and developed his character. And there is no doubt that we have a wide range of talented artists here where Sam Shepard, Fred Ward, Ed Harris and Dennis Quaid dominate the canvas and capture our full attention. There's no way to single out just one or two, I think each of them did the best they could with what they had at hand, and director Kaufman got the best out of them all.\r\n\r\nIt's a very light film, not a dense drama full of technical aspects or complicated ideas. The film even manages to give us an idea of the political and financial management of the project, and the use that American politicians were making of it for electoral purposes. There's some room for humor, but it's not a movie that makes us laugh out loud. The most comical situation for me was the way in which an American vice president was stopped at the door of an astronaut's house by his wife. The dialogues are good, they are well written, and the visual and special effects used are convincing. This film also has good cinematography and a very atmospheric soundtrack."], ["Not only does it sting, it floats like a butterfly as well.\r\n\r\nAcademy Award Winner Best Picture, Academy Award Winner Best Director-George Roy Hill, Academy Award Winner Best Screenplay-David S.

I have seen it written that the film's success was only garnered because of the star appeal of the leads! Well for starters that is an insult to Robert Shaw who may be accused of overdoing it at times, but his portrayal of Lonnegan is a complete joy, witness the fury on his face during an on train poker game as the irrepressible Newman does comedy gold. Visually the film is a delight, and the story fuses together to culminate in an ending that not only stings with impact; but also floats like a cinematic butterfly. 10/10", "Say what you like about the undoubted chemistry between Paul Newman (\"Henry\") and Robert Redford (\"Johnny\") this film belongs to a superb effort from the understated but hugely entertaining Robert Shaw. He's the hard-nosed gangster \"Lonnegan\" who gets (anonymously) fleeced by a \"Johnny\" who quickly decides that discretion is the better part of valour and gets out of Dodge. It's at this stage that the two grifters decide that their mark could be good for a great deal more money and so set up an elaborate operation purporting to be an undercover betting (on horses) proposition. Now \"Lonnegan\" ain't no easy target and every step they take is filled with danger - but slowly and surely the two, alongside a veritable army of fellow cons, start to piece together the ultimate lure for this clever, but ultimately greedy, man. Can they pull it off? Can they pull it off and survive? The films looks great, the writing is quickly-paced, humorous and it allows for loads of engagement between almost everyone - including an on-form Eileen Brennan and the charismatic \"Kid Twist\" (Harold Gould). The aesthetics are fabulous too - the sets, costumes, cars - even the tommy guns - all work really well adding huge richness to this cracking tale of the worm that turned. The Scott Joplin accompaniment is just icing on the cake of this classy and stylishly entertaining crime drama that I still love watching, fifty years on.", "**It is imperative to rediscover this magnificent film.**\r\n\r\nThere are many films about con artists and confidence games (Ocean\u2019s Eleven and its two or three sequels, for example), but I had never seen one that was so good-natured and in which the main characters were so likable. It's a light, family comedy from the 70s, in which a group of tricksters decides to risk their lives to deceive a powerful and rich mobster in order to avenge a friend, killed by his hitmen. This film was, at the time, a huge financial success in the USA and won notable awards, especially seven Academy Awards: Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Soundtrack, Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design, Best Editing and Best Art Direction!\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is difficult to believe that a film with such qualities has been forgotten, but it is true. I never saw it on television, I never heard much about it, I don't think it even had much visibility outside his country of origin. In Portugal there wasn't, but I understand why: the film premiered the day before the country experienced a military coup against the government, and the rest of that year was very complicated here, so no one was very willing to go to the movies. Therefore, I think that recapping this film and bringing it back to theater, in a possibly restored version, would be a gesture of complete justice to its quality.\r\n\r\nThe film has three enormous actors who deserve praise for the work done here: Robert Redford shows value and talent in a film that will open many doors for him, Robert Shaw offers us one of the best dramatic exercises of his artistic maturity and Paul Newman shines and enchants us in the role of an elegant and friendly swindler full of tricks. Seeing these three great actors together on stage is simply delightful. The film also has a good secondary cast, with Robert Earl Jones, Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan, Ray Walston and other good artists.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, we have to surrender to the impeccable cinematography achieved by the meticulous eye of director George Roy Hill, in cooperation with a team of good professionals, and which perfectly emulates old films from the 30s with the advantage of color, in tones deliberately brownish, golden and yellowish. The sets, props and costumes are simply incredible: the cars can make classic admirers salivate and the costumes deserve a place in the closet of any gentleman with a taste for the \u201cold-style\u201d elegance they exude. The period is well recreated and the situations balance dramatic tension and humor well. The soundtrack is solidly based on Scott Joplin's piano melodies and is wonderful to listen to, and the titles are magnificently well-designed and have art in themselves. It's a long film, two hours long, but it's so delightful to watch and so well edited that time flies by."], ["I can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him - and me.\r\n\r\nIt's funny really, writing a review for The Terminator these days just feels a little pointless, I mean anyone who wanted to see it would have done so already. In truth the effects work is a little creaky now but that doesn't matter, they were awesome in 1984. It's a ripper of a story awash with high energy action, rip-snorting characterisations and tech-noir atmospherics. It's place in the pantheon of science fiction films is assured, its influence on the genre undoubted, while the lead cast members cemented themselves in the sci-fi hall of fame.\r\n\r\nNo more needs to be said really, The Terminator is a kinetic live action comic book of a movie, classy movie making, paced to precision and featuring a story that's brilliantly complex and utterly compelling. 9/10", "Writing a review for a movie this old does indeed seem pointless, but since this is one of my favorite films I thought I would review it anyway. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion The Terminator is a beautiful, yet tragic love story set in the back drop of the future and the past. A soldier from the future is sent to the 80's to save the leader of the resistance (John Connor) mother from a High Tech Cybernetic Killing Machine. We all know that. What I loved was that this soldier, Kyle Reese volunteers for this suicide mission. He volunteers for one reason because, he had fallen in love with this woman, Sarah Connor. Though they were separated by several decades of time and Judgement Day, her son tells him these tales of his mother Sarah and gives him a single picture of her, purposefully pushing Reese to fall for his mother and this is the reason for him traveling through time to do the nearly impossible. Save and protect Sarah Connor to save the human race in the future and kill a super bad ass T-800 with low tech weaponry and a reluctant Damsel.\r\n\r\nBullets flying and bombs booming make this movie highly entertaining. The storyline, ridiculous as it is, is fantastic and had everyone in the 80's and 90's quoting this SciFi film. It's always a good watch. It holds up nicely overtime.", "I know saying this puts me in the minority, but the first _Terminator_ movie is actually my favourite of the franchise. That's not a knock on the second movie, _Judgment Day_ is **awesome**. But I really dig the lower down, dark, sci-fi horror vibe of the original (it **is** a knock on every movie in the series that came after _T2_ though).\r\n\r\nSchwarzenegger as the titular Terminator is inspired casting. Firstly, any restrictions he had in acting ability back in the 80s are brushed aside by the fact that he's playing a cold, unfeeling machine. And can you imagine someone who looks like that coming after you? Forget the fact he's got an arsenal in his back pocket, forget the fact that he's got a near unstoppable metal exoskeleton, Arnie is already a machine! Being hunted by that man would be terrifying, and you feel that in the performance of the leads.\r\n\r\n_The Terminator_ is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I have seen - a lot.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Ridiculously strong appeal.

I don't think it is Michael Biehn's fault, but Kyle Reese is kind of a forgettable character in this.\r\n\r\nThe depth of this action movie is just on the concept of time travel, and whether or not you can truly change the future.\r\n\r\nThis is a good movie, but it lacks something really special for the time of 2020, it's more important as a precursor to the sequel.", "Here we go, the movie that started it all and wasn't Arnold believable as a robot? He came across as threatening and creepy as all get out, and the thick accent really played for the role.\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, the plot was so unbelievable that it sucked everyone right in, from the start you suspended your disbelief because you knew it was going to be one heck of a ride.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was absolutely brilliant, everything seemed to fall into place perfectly for the first outing of the Terminator franchise and we got to see Sarah Connor transform from a frightened waitress at the start of the film, to someone that would become on of science-fiction's best known heroes by the end of it.\r\n\r\nIt was a truly fantastic film.", "**James Cameron\u2019s first film immediately showcases his unparalleled mastery of sci-fi action films and world building making The Terminator the gold standard of sci-fi thrillers.**\r\n\r\nThe Terminator franchise has its ups and downs, but it\u2019s hard to deny its iconic status and significant impact on pop culture. Many would pick Terminator 2 as the pinnacle of the franchise, but for me, it\u2019s the first one. While T2 made considerable upgrades to the original in every way, The Terminator was the directorial debut of James Cameron and in his first time in the director\u2019s chair, made a groundbreaking sci-fi masterpiece that has spawned five sequels, a tv show, video games, merchandise and so much more. The story and world established by this film are so rich and vast and a real credit to Cameron\u2019s writing ability. However, my favorite part and the reason The Terminator holds its place as the best in the franchise for me is the character of Kyle Reese. A war-hardened marine for the future who has suffered and fought to survive his entire life travels to the past or protect Sarah Conner, the mother to the savior of humanity in the coming war. Michael Biehn\u2019s performance is tough and heroic but carries the terror and suffering of all the years resisting the machines. He was my hero as a kid and every the namesake for my son! As important as John and Sarah Conner are to the Terminator story, Kyle Reese is its heart. The first film has dated effects (although incredible for its day) and a lower budget than its sequels, but the horror tones and fascinating characters will always make it one of my favorite films.", "Arnold Schwarzenegger arrives in 1984 Los Angeles, in his birthday suit, and on a mission. Firstly, to get some clothes then to eliminate all the \"Sarah Connor\" folks listed in the phone book. Moments later \"Kyle\" (Michael Biehn) arrives with the aim of thwarting this dastardly plan - and soon the race is on. Meanwhile, \"Sarah\" (Linda Hamilton) is blissfully unaware that she is a target until the news bulletins start reporting the brutal slaying of her namesakes. She is spooked, and takes refuge in a night club while the city's finest head to her rescue. Thing is, Arnie is not just a big muscly bloke, he's a big muscly killing machine - and a nigh-on immortal one at that. \"Kyle\" and \"Sarah\" now have their work cut out just to stay alive while they try to concoct a plan that will destroy her nemesis before it destroys them - and pretty much everyone else it comes into contact with! Aside from the synthesiser music - which has dated quite badly - this film still holds up as a solid and entertaining sci-fi horror film. True, the script is never top of James Cameron's priorities, and here is no different, but the pace of the film and the sparing but effective use of the special effects build to quite an exciting crush-endo that is good to watch with a surprising degree of jeopardy right until the very end. Hamilton is not a very good actress, but as the momentum builds she gels well with Biehn making the whole thing well a worth a watch on a big screen even now, almost forty years on."], ["Carpe Diem & The Punk Rock Movie.\r\n\r\nDead Poets Society is directed by Peter Weir (Picnic At Hanging Rock/Gallipoli) and stars Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Kurtwood Smith, Gale Hansen & Norman Lloyd. The script is written by Tom Schulman, based on his life at Montgomery Bell Academy, an all-boys preparatory school in Nashville, Tennessee. The film is set in 1959 at the fictional Welton Academy in Vermont (location shoot from St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Delaware). The story follows that of English teacher John Keating who uses his different method of teaching to inspire his students to be all that they can be whilst warning of the perils of conformity.\r\n\r\nDead Poets Society was a monster smash hit that made almost $220 million profit in Worldwide box office takings. Not bad considering this was the year that film lovers flocked to see the likes of Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and the third outing for one Indiana Jones. It showed that there was a mainstream market for serious drama if it is done well. And rest assured, Dead Poets Society is done well, very well in fact. Its launchpad is Schulman's Academy Award winning script that puts under the microscope educational conformity and the ogres that are parental and peer pressure. Enter the inspired casting of Robin Wiliams (nominated for BAFTA & Academy Award for Best Actor) as the teacher who urges his charges to see outside of the box that they have been placed in. Young men, soon to be full adults, who have their lives mapped out for them, are challenged by Mr Keating to be spontaneous, to pursue idealism and view life with new perspectives.\r\n\r\nComing two years after he was nominated for Good Morning Vietnam, Williams once and for all proves to his doubters that he is a quality dramatic actor. His Keating is charismatic but without the mad-cap histrionics that Williams is famed for. Very controlled, in that what is in essence a catalyst role, Keating hasn't rushed to become said catalyst. He's a constant sympathetic presence, a father figure type, yet a confidential friend too. That Schulman's script has avoided the usual clich\u00e9s that come with teacher-student relations in film's helps Williams as an actor to breath intelligent life into Keating. Even the flecks of humour that Williams is allowed to work from, such as Brando doing Shakespeare, play with a warmth that's essential to the relationships forming in the piece. Tho it's unquestionably Williams' movie (the film soars when he is on screen), the young cast playing the students get an A + for their sensitive portrayals. Notably Robert Sean Leonard (heartfelt), Ethan Hawke (haunting) & Gale Hansen (punky). While Kurtwood Smith leaves an indelible image as a domineering father.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of Weir, the film, unsurprisingly to his fans, carries an air of mysticism too. Again working with one of his regular DOP's, John Seale, Weir knows how to capture the time, place and people in his movies; while cloaking them in dashes of mystical beauty. Be it the boys striding around the school grounds amidst autumnal hues, or plodding wearily thru the snowy terrain as Winter kicks in, Weir gives the scenes an apt poetic quality. It's also of note that these scenes, as well as the cave sequences where the Dead Poets Society meetings take place, blend with the characters emotional states. Sprightly and optimistic around the greenery, nervous and excited in the darkened cave, then heavy of heart and leg as the fall accompanies the emotionally turbulent last quarter. A last quarter that leads to what has now become a divisive ending. Some have (and will) come away from it irked and claiming it to be syrupy. Others such as myself find it uplifting, hopeful and a fitting end to the emotional roller-coaster that cast and crew have taken us on. Is your glass half full or half empty? An excellent and intelligent story is directed and acted accordingly, with its themes making it actually one of the best Punk Rock movies out there. 9/10", "_**Seize the day; be Exceptional!**_\r\n\r\nJohn Keating (Robin Williams), a new teacher at a stuffy prep school in 1959, inspires his students to capitalize on their natural talents and develop a passion for life because they only have one shot and in 60 years or so they'll all be worm-food. Each boy starts to act on Keating's dynamic ideas with explosive consequences , both good and bad.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1989 and directed by Peter Weir, \"Dead Poets Society\" is a coming-of-age drama that's one of the most inspiring films ever made and ranks with my all-time favorite movies. The film captivates from the very beginning and doesn't release until it's over. That's when you KNOW a movie's really good, regardless of the subject matter. The cinematography and locations are top rate, shot in the Middletown region of Delaware (although the story itself takes place in Vermont). The quiet Fall & Winter scenes are breathtaking.\r\n\r\nThis is not a spoiler, but there's a powerful scene at the climax where the students give Keating a daring final salute. Roger Ebert criticized the scene as \"so moving he wanted to throw up,\" but he's dead wrong. It is both unexpected and potent.\r\n\r\nThe film contains a wealth of riches to mine in subsequent viewings, and I don't just mean the insights conjured from the poetry & prose. Here are a handful off the top of my head: \"The letter kills,\" referring to the legalistic nature of Neil's joyless father and most of the teachers at the school; the type of Judas (Cameron); the scapegoat (Keating); the stunning nature of feminine beauty (when Chris appears at the entrance of the school and the guys' mouths drop); the marvels of nature and how they're conducive to inspiration & spirituality; Keating's heartbroken countenance after Neil is removed from the theater crowd (Keating knows there's little he can do about the authoritarian mistreatment).\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of insignificant scenes that don't work so well, but that's always the case, even with the best of films.\r\n\r\nOne possible objection is that one boy's tragedy goes against the very message of the film to \"seize the day.\" I disagree. The kid really started to \"seize the day\" but his passions were quenched by someone who didn't share Keating's mindset and he unfortunately couldn't handle it. Again, dynamic ideas have explosive consequences, good and bad. The other kids had varying results with their attempts to \"seize the day.\" Some made progress in attaining their dreams and others got in trouble because they threw wisdom to the wind. The varying results make the story realistic.\r\n\r\nAnother criticism was voiced by a reviewer who stated that the late night meetings at the cave to read poetry and inspire one another were \"homo erotic.\" This interpretation could only be derived by an adult in our gay-obsessed modern culture. The kids in the film are about 16-17 years-old. This was the only way they could go out and have fun under the strict rules of a New England prep school in 1959. I remember when I was a teenager going out to the treehouse with several guys and drinking & smoking; we'd sometimes discuss metal/rock lyrics, which could be viewed as a delinquent form of poetry, and other such things. Sometimes we'd bring a girl or three. Likewise, in two of the cave meetings in the film one of the guys brings a couple babes from another school whilst the others look on in awe; on two other occasions a guy brings nude pages of whoa-men. I think that pretty much quells the \"homo-erotic\" theory.\r\n\r\nMost of those who scoff at this film's message go back to their 9 to 5 slavery (or 3 to 11 or 11 to 7, etc.) with no light at the end of the mundane tunnel. I encourage such people to give the film a second look. But BEWARE, there are no moronic explosions, CGI, non-stop 'action,' gore, OTT cussing, nudity or sex scenes; I know that's completely shocking, but it's true. Then I would encourage these people to take a good look at their lives and ask: Are you willing to change it? Throw off the shackles? Throw caution to the wind and pursue your true calling, your dream? Will you \"sieze the day\"? Or will you continue to stagnate in a puddle of mediocrity? The answer that comes back will usually determine if this film becomes a favorite or not.\r\n\r\nFINAL ANALYSIS: Australian director Peter Weir has other good films like \"Witness\" and \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" (the latter is, incidentally, a film about an ALL-GIRLS school and can be boring if you're not in the mood for an ultra-mystery yarn), but \"Dead Poets Society\" is his best. Check it out. Give it a second (or third) chance if you haven't already. It's an outstanding story and it'll inspire you, especially if you've fallen into a life-stifling, growth-stultifying rut of drudgery.\r\n\r\nThe film runs just over two hours (128 minutes).\r\n\r\nGRADE: A+", "Robin Williams (\"Keating\") arrives at an all boys school where he is to teach them English. As you'd expect, they weren't particularly interested, but when he begins by telling them to rip up the poetry manual, and continues with an inspirational and vocational approach the pupils start to engage not only with him, but they set up the eponymous club which helps each of them to develop as a person. This is quite a task for the shy young \"Todd\" (easily the most effective performance of Ethan Hawke's career) and for aspiring actor \"Neil\" (a terrifically measured and sincere Robert Sean Leonard) who is struggling to reconcile his own desires with those of his loving, but over-bearing, father who wants him to go to Harvard and become a lawyer. This is a terrific character based drama with Williams on great form, but he features quite sparingly - the thrust of this potent, funny and thought-provoking narrative rests with the young men. Their ensemble effort exposes a myriad of layered teenage foibles from trauma to Tennyson; Shakespeare to sex (or sax!) - with well written and delivered dialogue that focuses poignantly and cleverly on their maturing personalities. This film is highly recommended."], ["Dustin Hoffman is great in this as the impressionable twenty-one year old \"Ben\" who falls prey to the wiles of the woman immortalised by Simon & Garfunkel. \"Mrs Robinson\" (Anne Bancroft) is married to the husband of his father's business partner. She is sexy, alluring, sophisticated - and he, well he is just young, naive and horny. Their assignations proceed with few problems but in parallel, his own family are trying to hook him up with her daughter \"Elaine\" (Katharine Ross). The plot thickens and poor old \"Ben\" finds him self more and more conflicted, Whom might he choose? Whom might he be allowed to choose? Can their secret stay just that? What, I think, keeps this stylish effort from Mike Nichols relevant fifty-odd years later is it's ability to expose the human, visceral, need for sex, for love, for \"more\" - without graphically demonstrating it! How characters evolve into more rounded, measured, less \"instant\" human beings - and Hoffman carries that development role off perfectly. Bancroft is simply a class act. She manages to morph from glamorous wife and mother to seductress and back again with a distinct panache and chic that is both menacing and tantalising in equal measure. You just know that the equilibrium, the balance of power and dependency between the two will change, it has to - but how? That's the question. At what cost - collateral, emotional, personal? The production standards are excellent, the dialogue potent and the chemistry between the initially hapless Hoffman and Bancroft palpable. Of course, a memorable soundtrack helps it along too and if you can see this on a big screen, then it's well worth the effort.", "**A good example of a film that was extremely notable in its time, but that is not very relevant today.**\r\n\r\nThis film is considered by some to be one of the best that US cinema has given us. It is also the film that catapulted to fame the discreet Dustin Hoffman, one of the most consistent and solid actors of his generation. There is no doubt that he deserved the status, in this and other films that followed. However, considering this film as one of the best ever made in the USA doesn't seem fair to me: the film is satisfactory, it was a huge success at the time and had an impact on pop culture, but it has aged poorly, and today it seems like nothing more than a minor work.\r\n\r\nThe script is, perhaps, the key point to understanding the film: a love triangle between a young man inexperienced with women, a seductive older woman and her young daughter, with whom he falls in love. Released in 1967, in the wake of the Sexual Revolution and a growing challenge to society's values and morals, it is a film with a strong focus on the characters' sexuality and which places women in the role of seductress before a beardless, clumsy male figure. The sexual evocations are discreet in our eyes \u2013 we are too used to films with explicit sexual content \u2013 but enough to shock and excite people at the time and give the film a huge success at the box office.\r\n\r\nHowever, let's be honest: watching the film today, it's forgettable. I understand the impact it had and the way it was viewed, but it has aged poorly and seems somewhat dated, uninteresting and conventional. On the other hand, there is a huge lack of morality, an implicit nihilism that is only rebutted when Hoffman's character fights for love, finding a meaning that goes beyond carnal attraction, even though the story between these two characters seems totally unbelievable.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has nothing special, and takes on a conventional aspect as it bets all its chips on the story told and the performance of the cast. There is only extra care in some details, such as the excellent soundtrack, with songs by Simon & Garfunkel, made specifically for the film and which are now known even to those who have never seen it. Dustin Hoffman deserved all the attention he got: he carried the film on his back and wisely took advantage of the opportunity to boost his career. However, he is the only interesting actor in the film. Anne Bancroft fulfills what is required of her, but does not go beyond that, and Katherine Ross is not well used."], ["Upon cinematic release, being fascinated with Bridget Fonda, I watched 'Point of No Return', which I enjoyed but had no idea it was based on Besson's film. Badham's work was okay in my books, but nothing spectacular. Over the years I had loved those films of his I had seen ('Leon: The Professional', 'The Fifth Element', 'The Family' and 'Lucy'), and decided I wanted to see his earlier classic. I like the fact that Besson always has some hand in the writing, and the exquisite and graceful small part he wrote for acting legend Jeanne Moreau, virtually a microcosm of everything splendid she had ever brought to the screen. Besson has a very good feel for the genres his films represent--he plays to his strengths, and is not afraid to stick to his guns (for example, I'm glad he chose the ending that he did). The two significant extras on my DVD, remarking on the making of the film, and the sound selections by scorer Eric Serra, were both informative and entertaining, and added significant value. I highly recommend the experience to those who only think of 'The Fifth Element' when they think of Luc's work--you're in for a real treat...", "**One of the most striking films in Luc Besson's work.**\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps one of the most iconic films in the cinematographic work of Luc Besson, who is one of those directors who are hardly consensual or pleases everyone, but has an undeniable talent. The story revolves around a rebellious girl who becomes involved in a crime and the death of a police officer. Arrested, she seems completely out of control, is violent and seems to hate everyone who speaks to her. What happens next is perhaps the most poorly explained twist in the entire film: someone has the idea of faking her death in prison and taking her, against her will, to a spy training center run by the French government. Between a rock and a hard place, she has no option but to become a highly trained assassin.\r\n\r\nThe film is quite good, if we exclude the first half hour, which is quite surreal and in which the events are very underwritten. Luc Besson, who directed and wrote the script, is very good, but he didn't know how to put that young woman in a situation where she actually had to become a professional spy. Besides, why her? What was so special about her that she was forcibly selected for something so sensitive and where cold blood is so essential? In any case, from the moment he does this, the film runs smoothly and glides effortlessly until the end.\r\n\r\nAnne Parillaud is good enough for the role and gives it what she needed, but she is not at all an attractive or sensual woman, as the film tries to sell, showing her with barely any clothes on whenever she can. Jean Reno does a very good job, although short, which seems like a rehearsal for what the actor will do later, in \u201cL\u00e9on\u201d. Marc Duret and Patrick Fontana gave life to the two main actors in a very correct and committed way. On a technical level, I would highlight the effects, discreet but effective, and the choice of sets and filming locations. Personally, I hated the soundtrack, but that was a problem in other Besson films, not just this one. It seems that the director has a particular taste for soundtracks that seem to be taken from cheap erotic films."], ["Colonel Bogey's Barmy Army.\r\n\r\nOK!

Kubrick chose a perfect cast and uses the timing and music to create a greatly opressing atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNicholson is superb, but Duval and the kid are not less good.", "This rum is red, man!\r\n\r\nIn spite of author Stephen King not being happy with Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of his novel, The Shining (1980) has proved to be a critical and commercial darling.\r\n\r\nIt may not be in the spirit that King wanted, but it's undeniably a skillful piece of film making, a mixture of beauty and terror, of bravura techniques and simple but effective scares. With quality acting performances to match as well. The story unfolds at a deliberately slow pace, claustrophobia oozes from practically every frame, while the narrative smarts brings to bear the ghosts of the human and supernatural kind, all bone chillingly rendered for great effect by the vast spaces - the cold winter grounds outside - of the Overlook Hotel.\r\n\r\nIt's not all perfect, the screenplay is very average, which makes Kubrick's work even more impressive, but with that comes the wave of feeling about style over substance. A churlish gripe? Maybe? But with Jack Nicholson on scenery chewing overdrive and Kubrick pulling the strings, The Shining still represents a highlight in horror. A horror movie that all horror fans should see at least once - and in the best format available as well! 8/10", "Probably my favorite of the Stephen King adaptations (though not much for many of the others save for a one or two) but not amongst Stanley Kubrick's, watched this one for the first time in many years (maybe a decade) and while I did immensely enjoyed it, and really liked Nicholson towards the end, I never really bought into him early on. Still, atmospherically it was amazing and at times creepy. But can't place this as some sort of classic in my book, anyway.\u00a0**4.0/5**", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nWith Doctor Sleep, an almost 40-year sequel to The Shining, being released this week, now it\u2019s the perfect time to revisit one of the greatest horror movies of all-time, as well as one of the most influential directors ever, Stanley Kubrick. I know, I know\u2026 Spoiler-free? For a movie released in 1980? Well, first of all, there\u2019s always someone who still didn\u2019t watch it. Secondly, as deeper we get into the 21st century, the more the 60s/70s/80s/90s movies are forgotten. And finally, if there\u2019s a movie which I don\u2019t need spoilers to explain how outstanding it is, it\u2019s The Shining. With that said \u2026\r\n\r\nIt has always been one of my favorite horror films ever. It\u2019s not perfect (no film is) and some aspects don\u2019t work as well now as they did 5/10/20 years ago. When it came out, Kubrick\u2019s adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s novel was received with mixed reactions. King himself criticized the movie. However, less than 10 years later, Kubrick\u2019s film was already being reevaluated. Nowadays, it\u2019s considered a cult classic, and it\u2019s easy to understand why. From the countless homages to the hundreds of comedic parodies, The Shining has some of the most memorable lines ever. Just this year, we had It: Chapter Two mimicking Jack Nicholson\u2019s \u201cHere\u2019s Johnny!\u201d scene, for example. And then there\u2019s the mysterious \u201credrum\u201d\u2026\r\n\r\nHowever, the movie\u2019s biggest influence is its technical achievements. I apologize in advance if this review becomes too technical, but it\u2019s impossible not to address the arguably best component of the film. This movie was one of the first to use Steadicam (a camera stabilizer mount which allows for smooth shots, even on irregular surfaces, isolating the operator\u2019s movement), something that became so common that people don\u2019t even praise anymore. Honestly, there are still a bunch of recent movies that have terrible camera work, so I\u2019m one of those who defend that the Steadicam use shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted. Especially how Kubrick did, barely above the floor, which originated the extension \u201clow-mode\u201d that now exists and allows for the operator to easily shoot lower than its waist.\r\n\r\nWith the innovative use of the technical equipment, Kubrick\u2019s delivers a masterclass in framing (composing the visual content of a series of frames as seen from a point of view). So much that it became worthy of studying. Almost every shot in this movie has a visual clue or an underlying theme. If you ever feel bored during your viewing, then you\u2019re (probably) not \u201cwatching it right\u201d. You\u2019re not truly thinking about it or looking around the characters. This isn\u2019t a generic horror flick with monsters or demons jump scaring you. It\u2019s heavy on visual storytelling, so if you don\u2019t pay attention, you\u2019re going to reach the film\u2019s climactic and enigmatic ending and feel that you missed something.\r\n\r\nFrom the mise-en-scene (arrangement of everything that appears in the framing, hence this French term that means \u201cplacing on stage\u201c) having several blood-red colors to the wide shots clearly showing \u201cexit\u201d signs and giving the maze-vibe of the enormous hotel, the imminent danger is visually spread out across the movie. The symmetry/mirroring is absolutely crucial to not only deliver key plot points but to create this sense of reality vs fantasy. From the hotel\u2019s structure and decoration (everything is incredibly symmetric) to the growing use of mirrors (these are heavily used to either literally translate words or to show the descent into madness), Kubrick\u2019s framing is what leaves viewers scratching their heads, still to this date.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll always find something new on another viewing. It might be from 1980, but it\u2019s a movie that requires your full attention. Don\u2019t underestimate films from the 20th century like you can\u2019t be surprised by a film \u201cthat old\u201d (you\u2019ll be dumbfounded by dozens). If John Alcott\u2019s cinematography is impressive, then what can I write about Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind\u2019s haunting score? Nowadays, scores are more based on creating an emotional impact on specific moments. However, throughout the film and during dialogues, even epic films still have a subtlest approach to these scenes, and the music is either very quiet or completely inexistent.\r\n\r\nIn The Shining, the score is part of the conversation. If a character feels fear or danger is imminent, a simple heartbeat can elevate such a moment. If two characters gradually turn their dialogue into something more violent and aggressive, the music makes sure to accompany that descent into craziness. It\u2019s a perfect horror film\u2019s score. Technically, I\u2019ll stop there because no words will be able to express how mind-blowing Kubrick\u2019s visionary methods are. He\u2019s one of the greatest directors ever, maybe even the most influential. Hopefully, his work will always be remembered and never stop being relevant.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, The Shining also inspired a whole new generation. Everyone knows and loves the key moments of the film, but it\u2019s the clever exposition that satisfies me. Every piece of information is given through either an incredibly captivating dialogue or visual clues/actions. I watched the 144min version of the film (the European version has 25min less than the American version, and the latter has a final scene at a hospital edited out by Kubrick himself), and pretty much every single scene is intended to mean something. It can be important new information or an update on a previous plot point, but every single sequence has a particular purpose.\r\n\r\nJack Nicholson commands the screen with a phenomenal performance, one of his career\u2019s best. His script might be very well-written, but his delivery and commitment to the role are astonishing. He carries one-take, extense dialogues seamlessly. Credit to Kubrick for making a movie with at least 2/3-minute takes, sure, but Nicholson is able to transform a good scene into a fantastic one. Danny Lloyd delivers one of my favorite young performances ever. His voice as Tony is a great accomplishment, and he seems to understand his surroundings, in a way that I never felt like I needed to \u201cgo easy\u201d on him because he\u2019s just impeccable. \r\n\r\nShelley Duvall, however, is a mixed bag for me. Over-the-top displays were better received at the time, but almost 40 years later, her performance does reach an unbearable level a few times. She\u2019s an amazing counterpart for Nicholson and she stands her own within their dialogues, but when she\u2019s alone or in an emotionally troubled moment, she\u2019s too much to handle. Scatman Crothers doesn\u2019t have that much screentime as Dick Halloran, but he shines every time he has to deliver a line. Some people complain about the slow pacing, but I love how it helps elevate the suspense and building up moments of immense tension. While the ending might be just a tad abrupt, the final image of the film stays with us forever, and after all this time, I still didn\u2019t settle on my own theory.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Shining might be one of the most accessible classics to new viewers of today to understand why it is, in fact, one of the greatest and most influential horror films of all-time. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s masterclass in framing with his play on symmetry and mirrors is evident, so even if you don\u2019t study the art of filmmaking, it\u2019s clear that these two themes are vital to telling the story. In addition to his framing, his use of the innovative Steadicam and his notable mise-en-scene shaped an entire new generation that never misses a chance of paying homage to his work. Besides the impressive technical achievements, Jack Nicholson delivers a memorably haunting performance. The ending is still mind-blowing after all these years, and new theories keep coming up. While I\u2019ll keep trying to settle on my own interpretation, don\u2019t you dare spend the rest of your life without (re)watching this cult classic.\r\n\r\nRating: A+", "\"Darling, I'm not gonna hurt you.

A quick prologue sets things up nicely, then BAM! Ash (Campbell) and his squeeze are in the cabin of doom and about to be part of a night of unholy demonic terror.\r\n\r\nIt's a nightmare of the black comedy kind, where Raimi and Campbell invite us to a party and then gleefully pummel us into submission - and we sado-masochistically enjoy it! Ash has grown a pair of cojones and decides to fight back against the demonic forces, cue mucho action with chainsaw and shotgun. There's a quip on the tongue for our hero as well, even as he is battered from pillar to post to make the action work.\r\n\r\nRaimi isn't interested in extraneous scenes or exposition, he strips it bare as the pic hurtles along, all while he brings his technical skills with camera and sound design to the fore. The humour is often outrageous, dementedly so, while it's nice to find a group of film makers who don't feel the need to now throw blood and guts at the screen every other scene just to make a formulaic impact.\r\n\r\nBonkers, chilling and devilishly funny. 8/10", "RELEASED IN 1987 and written & directed by Sam Raimi, \u201cThe Evil Dead\u201d chronicles events when two Michigan State students (Bruce Campbell & Denise Bixler) travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. The daughter of the archeologist who made the tape (Sarah Berry) also visits the cabin with her beau (Richard Domeier) and a couple of dubious locals (Dan Hicks & Kassie Wesley DePaiva).  \r\n\r\nThe first film was low-budget, cartoony and extreme, but it was serious horror. This sequel is also cartoony and extreme, but it\u2019s decidedly comedy horror. It\u2019s entertaining for what it is, but it\u2019s hindered by a confusing opening \u201crecap\u201d that doesn\u2019t match the previous film. Raimi stated that he didn\u2019t have the rights to use material from the original movie so he did a 7-minute recap with only two people instead of five (with Denise Bixler taking over the role of Linda). But there are other inconsistencies: The Book of the Dead and audiotape is found in a room rather than the basement and Ash (Campbell) later \u201crediscovers\u201d that the bridge is out, which he already knew via events in the first film. \r\n\r\nOnce you get past the awkward and perplexing set-up, the movie settles into an entertaining over-the-top gory horror comedy, which is so creative it\u2019s as if it was made by a lunatic. Bixler is a great replacement in the role of Linda, but her part is too brief and you only catch glimpses of her stunning beauty. It took me a while to warm up to Annie (Berry), but I eventually did and she\u2019s a worthy secondary protagonist. There are several amusing and thrilling sequences, like the demonic hand scenes.      \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 24 minutes and was shot in Wadesboro and (studio) Wilmington, North Carolina, with supplementary work done in Detroit.

He is not a great actor by any stretch, but he does have a rather boyish charm that moves the film along, even if the script is as creaky as the rocking chair in his cabin!\r\n\r\nDefinitely made on a shoestring budget, and the sfx (no cgi here!) are not all that great, but it doesn't matter because you're just there for the ride; and to be fair there are some very good fx splashed around throughout, and the first person camera-eye of the Evil Spirit in the Wood, is also well done.\r\n\r\nGroovy!", "The Evil Dead II takes everything fans loved from the original and ramps it up to one thousand, but is that such a good thing? The direction from Raimi is very present once again with fantastically creative shots and quick zooms that are such a staple of his. The story is way more fleshed out here, with interesting flash backs that give the original an entirely new perspective. The special effects are better than the original, and we get to see a lot more of what the evil entity is. But with all the positives this movie has, it is just missing something that I cannot put my finger on. The original felt so genuine, and I think the low budget helped increase the tension and horror of the possessions. Here the tone is a little campier and I just don't resonant with it as much as the original. It is still a great film, and one of the better horror films of the 80s, but I do not hold it as high as most unfortunately.\r\n\r\nScore: 81% \u2705\r\nVerdict: Great", "**I don't understand the hype.**\r\n\r\nWhen watching this film, I got the serious impression that \u201cArmy of Darkness\u201d ended up being a kind of sequel or spin-off to this work, considering the themes involved and the persistence of the main actor, Bruce Campbell. Both films have similarities, and it's hard not to think about it.\r\n\r\nSam Raimi is one of those directors who have made a name for himself in horror cinema, but I can't help but think that this is one of his poorest works. \u201cEvil Dead\u201d is dark, it's bizarre, it's full of gore and scenes that make you want to throw up your popcorn, but it's not the kind of film I would watch again. With a miserably low budget and a lot of creativity, the director manages to disgust us more than to scare us, and there is little in this film that can really instill fear or dramatic tension. In fact, there are scenes that dangerously border on comedy.\r\n\r\nBruce Campbell does what he can, and what he does is enough to guarantee protagonism due to the absolute lack of a capable and competent cast. The actor is not completely devoid of ability or talent, but he seems to have limited himself to this, and similar films. It goes without saying that the rest of the cast doesn't even deserve a mention in this review, as they are absolute amateurs or people who made mistakes in their profession. And of course the Necronomicon, a book created by the fantasy imagination of H. P. Lovecraft, has a relevant role in the plot and is absolutely fearsome. In the midst of this funny disaster, what saves this film a little is the way Raimi takes the opportunity to study cheap visual and special effects, and the results he can get from them. Buckets of paint, raspberry juice, bizarre synthetic makeup similar to carnival faces, we have almost everything."], ["Funny story done to fit on Bill Murray's shoes.\r\n\r\nIt is good enough and with a moral for the family but I don't get it what this is such a famous movie.", "I can watch this movie again and again and again.

In a reversal of _It's a Wonderful Life_, rather than Bedford Falls being worse off from George's absence, Punxsutawney is better off with Phil's presence.

An incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema, regardless of being a genre fan or not. 10/10", "This movie directed by Clint Eastward is one of my big three. Three westerns I am willing to watch multiple times when the opportunity arises. (The other two are Once Upon a a Time in the West and The Good the Bad and the Ugly.) All three of those movies are gritty, but not necessarily realistic. The Wild West didn\u2019t see many Gun fights where a gunman  outshoots four or five guys facing  him. And yet, if we saw a movie gunfight where they are shooting pistols at each other and missing all over the place, that might seem unrealistic to us. Movie magic.\r\n\r\nSo Eastwood plays a former ruthless bad guy who we root for now, and Gene Hackman plays a good guy lawman who is cruel and easy to root against. The dialogue is excellent, such as what Bill Munny says after her shoots a bar owner. There is some humor, as usual for his movies, especially concerning the bragging Schofield. I could go on and on, but you may be one of those lucky ones who hasn\u2019t seen it and still has it to look forward to.", "_**\u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a thing, killing a man\u201d**_\r\n\r\nIn 1880-81, Big Whiskey, Wyoming, a prostitute\u2019s face is cut up by an offended patron. When the big, tough sheriff (Gene Hackman) goes soft on the two cowboys responsible, the vengeful women collect their assets for a \u201cwhore\u2019s gold\u201d reward to attract a hit man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman play old pardners who are interested in teaming up with a young kid (Jaimz Woolvett) to earn the money. Saul Rubinek plays a maker of Western legends while Richard Harris is on hand as the deadly English Bob.       \r\n\r\nDirected by Eastwood, \"Unforgiven\" (1992) is a downbeat Western with a bit o\u2019low-key humor. It\u2019s marred by a pall of ugliness and darkness, but it has grim realism in its favor. It\u2019s all about what it takes to kill/abuse people and the ramifications thereof. Munny (Eastwood) is haunted by it, the hardened Sheriff leads by it, Ned (Morgan) discovers he just can\u2019t do it anymore, English Bob relishes it for celebrity status while the \u2018Schofield Kid\u2019 is just testing his mettle. \r\n \r\nFrances Fisher and Anna Thomson lead the female cast with the latter playing the scarred prostitute. Liisa Repo-Martell stands out as the young blonde. There are a few more.\r\n\r\nThere are several iconic scenes, but two moving ones come to mind: When the 'Schofield Kid' experiences an unexpected breakdown. And when the scarred girl shows honor for Munny's faithfulness to his beloved wife (even though she finds out later the wife had passed away; nevertheless Munny was still faithful to her). It's almost as if she marvels at the nobility of a man who refuses to be a faithless adulterer. Munny was really rehabilitated by his beloved and it was only a certain person's death that brings back the cold killer, albeit this time an agent of fearsome vengeance.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes, and was shot in Longview, Alberta, Canada (the town of Big Whiskey) and other areas of Alberta, as well as Red Hills Ranch, Sonora, California, for the train sequence.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+", "It's good!\r\n\r\nI have to say I'm a little surprised to see just how highly regarded this is, given I had - somehow, evidently - never even heard of it until scheduling this Clint Eastwood watchathon of mine - all of the latter's other well received I had/have heard of, but not this. I don't check reviews etc. until after I view films and my jaw kinda dropped when I saw the 4.1 average rating, I won't lie.\r\n\r\nThat makes it sound like I think <em>'Unforgiven'</em> is bad, which I absolutely, most definitely do not. I honestly just found it to be a solid but unspectacular western flick from 1992. I really enjoy Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman as actors and they are all good value in this. There is also some neat cinematography, while the production is well paced.\r\n\r\nHappy for all involved that this did do bits with awards et al., even if it is a tad unexpected for me - what do I know!"], ["**Entertaining**\r\n\r\nA man goes back in time to save his mother - or something like that anyway - I was too entertained to fully grasp what was going on.  Seriously, this film moves so fast that you will find yourself having to try your hardest to keep up with it.\r\n\r\nGreat movie. Great soundtrack. Great performances. A shame that the sequels did not live up to this one. \r\n\r\n- Ian Beale", "Earth Angel And The Nuclear DeLorean.\r\n\r\nIt's 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future - a film about a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn't capturing the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice anyway but couldn't get a release slot from shooting with Family Ties. Luckily the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play Marty McFly as well as work on the show - the result of which would turn out to be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era.\r\n\r\nIt's honestly hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock \"n\" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually. Alan Silvestri provides a whirring & pleasing score and the theme song, The Power Of Love, by Huey Lewis & The News, is infectiously enjoyable. Finally it's the cast that seal the deal for why this is as good as it gets for fantasy escapist cinema. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson & Crispin Glover are the perfect quintet, each feeding off each other and doing justice to the excellently constructed story.\r\n\r\nMade for $19 million, Back To The Future went on to make a worldwide gross of over $381 million, and those are the kind of figures you really can't argue with. It's snappy, happy and down right funny, so really, if you don't like Back To The Future then seek medical help immediately. 10/10", "\"Robert Zemeckis remains the beating heart of modern science-fiction films\"\r\n\r\nThe first time I have ever redacted a critic was down in 2015, since then, I learned how impressive productions could change lives and start movements throughout the world. Back To The Future represents one of those films, such a powerful, inspirational, comical, heartwarming, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film (which, happily, could end up being top-notch of all time). There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinematic history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be thinking about the reason of having assessed the film as absolute perfection score.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back To The Future follows the proper steps to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping. Secondly, we balance the film's highest moments and ordinary moments with humour, some 50's nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains; therefore, they become fundamental. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film's core, as excellent as Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson's 2005 Wedding Crashers, I daresay. \r\n\r\nFinally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot's main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80's and 50's at school, at traditional coffee shops and the streets, not forgetting the excellent pop-culture references introduced.\r\n\r\nThe audience ought to congratulate Robert Zemeckis' mind and, also, the crucial support of his staff (one of whom was Steve Spielberg) owing to this masterpiece. The montage is proof that everyone who has an incredible imagination is capable of creating chef-d'oeuvres, delivering the audience such an extraordinary time. What is more exhilarating is the fact that then-president Ronald Reagan loved the film to the point that he used famous BTTF quotes, for example, during his 1986 State of Union Adress. What an achievement ladies and gentlemen!\r\n\r\n(90/100)", "Not sure how many times I've seen this (first time was on VHS ~1986 or 87 I think) but still an incredibly fun sci-fi comedy with Fox and Lloyd working perfectly off one another. Holds up so well each and every time I re-visit. **4.5/5**", "Everyone who's ever seen this movie loves it. We all wish we could go back in time. I know I do.", "A quintasential '80s movie. A time-jumping rollercoaster ride everyone will enjoy getting on board.", "The first time I saw this movie I was 6 or 7 years old and my friend had it on VHS and since then I can't count the number of times I have seen it. Such a fun time travel adventure movie."], ["I love it. God help me I do love it so. I love it more than my life. \r\n\r\nPatton is directed by Franklin J Schaffner and is adapted to screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North from Ladislas Farago's \"Patton: Ordeal and Triumph\" and Omar N. Bradley's \"A Soldier's Story\". It stars George C Scott, Karl Malden, Michael Bates, Edward Binns, John Doucette, Stephen Young, Michael Strong and Cary Loftin. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Fred J. Koenekamp.\r\n\r\nPic is a part biography of George S. Patton Jr. which follows his exploits in WWII until his retirement from service.\r\n\r\nReleased at the time of the Vietnam War, there's a certain bravado in the makers choosing this period to release a biopic about one of America's most famous - and controversial - military characters. Led by a tour de force performance by Scott as Patton, Shaffner and his team rightly portray the man as full of flag waving bluster, gigantic egotism and majestic tenderness. The complexity of the man in Scott's hands is what drives the film to greater heights.\r\n\r\nSchaffner's (Planet of the Apes) shows a smart eye for battle scene construction (shot in 70 millimetre - Dimension 150), this puts us viewers right in amongst the horrors of warfare. The supporting cast do sterling work in the face of Scott's barnstorming show, which when all told as a film leaves us with a war biography of great depth and one that rightly is held up as a marker for such genre ventures. 9/10", "**A good film about one of the most controversial generals of the Second World War.**\r\n\r\nPatton is one of the most controversial generals of World War II. A man guided by his killer instinct rather than reason, he played a relevant role in the defeat of the Germans, but he also took conflicts that greatly tarnished his military record. A US cavalry officer, he fought in the First World War and is one of the biggest names in the development of tanks and armored cars, both at the level of conception and strategy, where he valued rapid movements and aggressiveness. In World War II, he led Operation Torch, faced the German general Rommel and openly competed with Montgomery, who was more prudent in his approach. But he also blatantly ignored superior orders and assaulted soldiers who did not appear committed, so he was harshly censured and only recovered after the Battle of the Ardennes, when he supported the Allied forces.\r\n\r\nI think I can join most people in saying that the strong point here is the very solid performance of George C. Scott: he was extraordinarily convincing in the role of the \u201cBandit\u201d (one of the many barracks nicknames that Patton collected). He effortlessly steals all the attention and is a more than solid protagonist, to which we can add a consistent and competent supporting cast, featuring the worthy Karl Malden and Michael Bates.\r\n\r\nExpertly directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, the film features a magnificent script. I'm a historian, but I'm not an expert on the period in question and, therefore, I'm not the right person to evaluate the film's historical realism. However, I can say that I didn't see any glaring errors. The cinematography is very colorful and bright, making the most of the excellent sets, costumes and filming locations, which reproduce very well the settings and environments. However, if what you want is a war film with a lot of action, I have doubts about recommending this one: there isn't much here, except for some good fights. The film did well in the market, was profitable, and the critics were very receptive. In 1971, it won seven of the ten Oscars for which it was nominated, namely Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor (for Scott, who refused to accept it for not agreeing with the competition) and Best Film."], ["Let's make one thing clear right off the bat: this review is gonna be positive. _Akira_ is not only my favorite anime but my favorite animated film bar none and one of my favorite films in general. Katsuhiro Otomo has crafted an animated sci-fi actioner for adults that's good, great in fact, a rarity since the vast majority of \"adult\" animation fails miserably by relying on dopey sex jokes and idiotic plot rather than solid storytelling and likable characters. Otomo's film weaves together themes of friendship, honor, betrayal, the deadly consequences of playing God, gang war, espionage, corruption, and the abuse of power while maintaining a breakneck pace throughout its running time. Throw it all in a blender and you've got one of the greatest, if not _the_ greatest animated film of all time, a classic in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\nOn July 16, 1988, Tokyo was obliterated in a massive explosion, setting off World War III. In 2019, Tokyo has been rebuilt as Neo-Tokyo, a megalopolis crawling with malignant crime and governed by corrupt politicians where 16-year-old Shotaro Kaneda (Cam Clarke in the 1988 Streamline dub, Johnny Yong Bosch in the 2001 Pioneer dub, Mitsuo Iwata in Japanese) is the tough, cocky, skirt-chasing, and bullheaded leader of the Capsules, a biker gang that's currently at war with the Clowns, a band of savage rapists. Kaneda's gang consists of his friends, 15-year-old Tetsuo Shima (Jan Rabson, Joshua Seth, Nozomu Sasaki) who's like a brother to him, 15-year-old Kai (Bob Bergen, Anthony Pulcini, Takeshi Kusao), and 16-year-old Yama (Tony Pope, Michael Lindsay, Masaaki Okura) and a few others. During a brawl with the Clowns, students are protesting and an odd-looking boy named Takashi (Barbara Goodson, Cody Mackenzie, Tatsuhiko Nakamura) with psychic powers has been abducted. After Tetsuo takes down a Clown, his bike explodes upon nearly ramming Takashi. The boys arrive to find a battered Tetsuo. The army, led by Colonel Shikishima (Pope, Jamieson Price, Taro Ishida), arrives on the scene and takes both Tetsuo and Takashi away, while the boys are arrested. At the police station, Kaneda gets 17-year-old resistance member Kei (Lara Cody, Wendee Lee, Mami Koyama) released with them, having taken an interest in her. Dr. Onishi (Lewis Arquette, Simon Prescott, Mizuho Suzuki) and his team of scientists conduct experiments on Tetsuo, prompting his escape. After Tetsuo steals Kaneda's bike to run away with his girlfriend Kaori (Goodson, Michelle Ruff, Yuriko Fuchizaki) and both are attacked by the Clowns, Tetsuo beats a Clown to a pulp before he is again taken by the army to the facility that also holds Kiyoko (Melora Harte, Sandy Fox, Fukue Ito who is credited as Sachie Ito), Takashi, and Masaru (Bergen, Mackenzie, Kazuhiro Kamifuji who is credited as Kazuhiro Kando). When Kaneda tries to find out what happened to Tetsuo, he and Kei soon find that Tetsuo, newly equipped with telekinesis, is being consumed by psychosis, and after he murders one of their friends, an enraged Kaneda resolves to stop him.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably guess from the summary, there's a lot going on in _Akira_, enough that it takes a few times seeing it to get everything, making repeat viewings that much more rewarding. Even with Otomo having removed much of what was in his then-incomplete manga, there's still more than enough to warrant its 124-minute length. We see Kaneda worry about Tetsuo as a true friend does, Tetsuo lose his grip on sanity and become someone else, and Colonel Shikishima struggle against dirty politicians who only care about money; it's interesting, arguably scary, to consider how much of this stuff is actually happening in the real 2019 and _has been happening for ages_. We see the dangers of playing God in the result of Dr. Onishi's experimentation as Tetsuo wreaks havoc on Neo-Tokyo which also doubles for the abuse of power and even earlier when Colonel Shikishima says that maybe they should leave that power alone. We also get glimpses at honor when Kaneda tries to curb Tetsuo from killing a Clown he's already beaten severely and with Colonel Shikishima's musings on a soldier's duty. On top of that, Otomo throws in religious fanaticism as people blindly follow Tetsuo, thinking he's \u201cAkira.\u201d There's more where that came from and the stakes keep rising to keep you on the edge of your seat until the endgame brings things to a close with a bang. Due to Otomo and Izo Hashimoto's excellent writing skills, the film isn't overstuffed and nothing feels out of place.\r\n\r\nThe animation is stunning. All 327 colors are jaw-dropping; check out those reds. Each background is vastly detailed; the streets of Neo-Tokyo are gritty and grimy, buildings vary from excellent condition to run-down and deteriorated, we see walls and even a door with English profanity painted on them, and the sewers are as filthy as a real one while the interiors of the hospital are exceptionally clean in contrast to the clutter and graffiti of the school the boys attend. Each character looks like a real person, with the wide array of facial expressions that entails, while clothing looks like what real people wear. The gore is also highly realistic. Let it be stated right up front that anyone without an iron stomach will want to steer clear of _Akira_. Internal organs spill out, a cop loses half of his face, and limbs are removed, which is not to mention the mutation scene akin to something out of John Carpenter's _The Thing_. With that said, the gore serves the story rather than the reverse. The attention to detail goes even further to the few animals depicted in the film; the attack dogs near the beginning and even the dog that's seen in a commercial on a TV in the background look like real dogs and the rats in the sewer look like real rats. Put it all together and it's a depiction of 2019 that looks a lot like the real thing. Another element that never ceases to amaze is the way Otomo keeps everything perpetually moving. Otomo's decision to record the dialogue first and animate every nuance of the actor's mouth is where he pulls out all the stops since this wasn't done in Japan at the time, making it even more impressive that both dubs match the animation as well as they do.\r\n\r\nWhichever version one prefers, though this fan is partial to the Streamline dub - probably since it's how I first saw the film, performances excel across the board. Clarke, Yong Bosch, and Iwata are uniformly excellent as Kaneda, the tough, cocky and womanizing biker who cares about his friends and won't let anyone hurt them if he can help it, a lot like I was at that age; moreover, that was around the time my sister became consumed by psychosis in much the same way Tetsuo does. While some have argued against both Clarke and Yong Bosch (usually in favor of the other) as sounding too old, I don't think that's the case with either; when I was 16, I didn't sound all that far removed from Clarke's take, having had a naturally deep voice since age 12. Another argument some have made against Clarke is that he speaks in monotone, but nothing could be further from the truth; his tone changes appropriately with the situations the character finds himself in. The same can be said of Rabson, Seth, and Sasaki as Tetsuo, though Seth lags just a little behind. With that said, this can be partly attributed to the Pioneer dub script, though it _is_ grating that Seth often mispronounces Kaneda's name as \u201cKah-nee-duh\u201d rather than \u201cKuh-nay-duh\u201d or \u201cKah-nay-duh.\u201d Take the scene where Tetsuo advances on the soldiers in the government hospital and Seth says, \u201cIt's no use hiding anymore,\u201d while neither Rabson nor Sasaki says, \u201canymore.\u201d It's not that big a deal and it can be attributed to the Pioneer dub script, but it takes away from his menace some. With that said, all three portray him as an abused kid who loses his sanity and despite being the villain, you feel bad for him - or at least I do since I see a lot of my mentally ill little sister there. Cody, Lee, and Koyama are first-class across the board as Kei, portraying her as tough but sensitive, well in line with how Otomo conceived her. The same can be said of Pope, Price, and Ishida as Colonel Shikishima, playing up his no-nonsense attitude and sense of a soldier's duty. Bergen, Pulcini, and Kusao are superb as Kai, one of the film's most likable characters. So are Pope, Lindsay, and Okura as Yama, the most confrontational Capsule, and this can also be said for the rest of the three casts. Long story short, you can't go wrong with any of them and each dubbed or subbed option is entertaining in its own way and tells the story faithfully enough.\r\n\r\nMusic is a crucial part of any film. _Akira_ is no exception and the Geinoh Yamashirogumi are up to the challenge, using drums, chants, guitars, gamelan percussion, and even a church organ to form Akira's musical score. _Kaneda_ is the most recognizable, having been used in nearly every trailer. It's easy to see why; it's an exhilarating track and it's hard not to feel pumped once you've heard it. The same can be said of _Battle Against the Clowns_, _Tetsuo_, and _Exodus from the Underground Fortress_. The score mostly remains the same, with the only radically different version being the Japanese hypersonic track that Geinoh Yamashirogumi founder Shoji Yamashiro mixed in 2008 for the film's Blu-ray release. In this version, which Yamashiro mastered at 192 kHz, music has been moved around, some pieces are shortened, some are replaced with alternate versions, and the piece used during the flashback to Kaneda and Tetsuo's first meeting has been replaced with an organ, heavily altering the scene and not necessarily for the better; if you want my honest opinion, the flashback is more powerful with the original piece of music sampled from Requiem. That said, the entire score is incredible and I've listened to it countless times. In addition to the score itself, Otomo squeezes in _Tokyo Shoeshine Boy_ by Teruko Akatsuki during the scene at the mall where the groupies walk off from Kaneda, Kai, and Yama. Throw a head-turning sound design into the mix and you've got a terrific film that's firing on all cylinders.\r\n\r\n_Akira_ is a fun and exciting film I could watch over and over again; as of writing, I've seen it upwards of 30 times since my first viewing. Wanting to see it ever since age 11, it knocked my socks off when I finally saw it at 18. At 30 years old, it continues to stand the test of time. It's a timeless film, just as relevant today in 2019, if not more so than when it first dropped on Japan in 1988 and the United States in 1989. _Akira_ was one of the first anime to arrive in the western world uncut; without it, we may not have _Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind_ and many more of the best Japanese animation has to offer without a single frame removed. _Akira_ is the best animated film ever made for an adult audience and one of the best films of the 1980s, anime or otherwise. Its characters are well-drawn and feel real, it deftly handles global issues that are still at work today, its frenzied action scenes continue to thrill with repeated viewings and it's vastly quotable. Its imagery will remain burned within your psyche for the rest of your natural life and its musical score will ring inside your eardrums long after the credits roll. If you love sci-fi, love action and can stomach the violence, you should see _Akira_ at least once. Who knows? Maybe you'll like it and want to come back to it repeatedly. **Very highly recommended.**", "It has been said that when Oppenheimer witnessed the first atom bomb test, he said, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\" This may actually be a mis-translation of the Bhagavad-Gita, which deals with illusion and impermanence. Nevertheless, the sentiment that great achievement in science, like great power, carries great responsibility, remains true.\r\n\r\nYet to date, homo sapiens has consistently shown that it is not ready for this dilemma. The string of films and sci-fi novels that deal specifically with this subject is long and varied with many excellent examples: Lang's Metropolis, Robert Wise's The Day the Eartch Stood Still, The Terminator, Blade Runner, and Ex-Machina to name just a few.\r\n\r\nAkira is another, very well-done, classic in this field. The story-telling, the themes, the action, and especially the jaw-dropping animation are masterful, and likely unequaled in the genre.

However, I have to say that, even as a child, I hated this type of highly stylized animation, so different from what I was used to seeing.\r\n\r\nEven so, it is necessary to grant this film some value. The animation it brings us is of excellent quality and very well designed, and the perfectionism typical of Easterners is clearly evident in the attention given to the smallest details, scene by scene. As has been the hallmark of modern anime, it has a lot of action and moves in a futuristic, dream-like environment, much to the liking of the Japanese. In fact, it is quite remarkable that they are a people so attentive to the future and so respectful of their own traditions and their past... a good example of how both things are not incompatible, quite the contrary, a sign that we can build the future without cut with the past.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this film is that, until now, I haven't been able to understand the story. It's confusing, and the feeling I got is that the creators focused so much on the action and technical execution of the drawings that they totally forgot to do all of this based on a logical story, capable of being followed without difficulty. Is there something that I, with a Western mindset, have not been able to understand? I don't know. I just know that this film, regardless of its technical value, didn't work for me."], [], ["For what we are about to see next, we must enter quietly into the realm of genius. \r\n\r\nYoung Frankenstein is directed by Mel Brooks who also co-writes the screenplay with Gene Wilder. It stars Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Teri Garr and Madeline Kahn. Music is by John Morris and cinematography by Gerald Hirschfeld.\r\n\r\nFilmed in black and white, Brook's movie is an affectionate spoof of the Frankenstein movies that came out of Universal Studios back in the 1930s.\r\n\r\nThere wolf, there castle.\r\n\r\nYou are either a Mel Brooks fan or not, there doesn't seem to be any middle ground. However, even his most ardent fans admit not all of his productions have paid dividends, but when on song, as he was in 1974 (Blazing Saddles also released), it's justifiable that those fans proclaim him as a spoof maestro. Ineviatbly a bit tame when viewed today, Young Frankenstein is still a picture of high comedy and clinical execution of the film making craft. Everything works, from acting performances, the gags that are both visual and aural delights, to the set design of the Frankenstein castle. It also boasts a smooth storyline, this is not a hodge-podge of ideas lifted from those Universal monster classics, it has a spin on the story and inserts its own memorable scenes along the way (Puttin' on the Ritzzzzzzzz, Oh my!).\r\n\r\nOf its time for sure, but still great entertainment for the Mel Brooks fan. 8/10", "When I had the opportunity Ro watch this film again after decades, due to a Cloris Leachman tribute, I couldn\u2019t resist, despite feeling there was a risk of a familiar problem: that of me not liking a program or movie as a mature adult as much as I had as a young man.\r\n\r\nI needn\u2019t have worried. This is not Mensa material here, but it is a good example of what Mel Brooks did best, spoof movie genres or other cinematic cliches.\r\n\r\nEveryone seems to have great fun making this movie, and it shows. Some of the bits have become catch phrases: the horse neighing when a certain name is mentioned, the hilarious sight gag of the secret door (\u201cPut the candle back!), and other classic lines. This doesn\u2019t make any of my Favorites list, but it was well worth revisiting it for the laughs and a glimpse at what my younger self thought was funny, and older self agrees with him.", "I'd probably best start by saying that I love the writing of Mel Brooks, but I detest the acting style of Gene Wilder - so my views on this are somewhat mixed. It is a spoof - and James Whale ought to be writ large in the credits, as should Glenn Miller and a host of others who have inadvertently contributed to the wonderfully paced script that rarely draws breath. Wilder - the grandson of the eponymous, famously mad scientist - decides to visit Transylvania where he stumbles upon a formula that might just bring the dead back to life. In my view, the acting plaudits go to Marty Feldman, who is great as henchman \"Igor\" trying desperately to foil the over-the-top antics of the star - who just seems to play each role he takes on in the same, super-hammy, fashion with big eyes and loud, grand gestures that I find most unfunny. Coupled with Brooks, they are, however, on cracking writing form and as parodies go this sets up the whole genre - sometimes overtly and sometimes subtly, but regardless - when you listen to the dialogue you can't help but laugh. For me, it could have done with a less annoying star - but the writing has stood the test of time well and is still very much worth a watch.", "**One of the great comic films of the 70s.**\r\n\r\nMel Brooks is one of those names in comic cinema that I haven't explored much yet, and that I know more from his fame than from having seen his work. I decided to change that a little by watching this satirical film, which he directed, and in which a grandson of the infamous German doctor and nobleman Dr. Frankenstein, after years denying his name and any association with his grandfather, is called to the family castle for... what? In fact, the script badly explains this decision, but it is important for the film that he returns and that is what he will do. There, he contacts the locals and decides to further explore his grandfather's attempts to reanimate human corpses.\r\n\r\nAs already understood from these lines, the script is not this film's strong point, with a weak story and many problems with a lack of logic. The film needs the characters to make certain decisions, and they will make them without worrying that this corresponds to a logical and understandable attitude. Of course, being a comedy, this is unimportant, and the nonsense also adds to the film's joke, but there are one or two moments where I missed this logic.\r\n\r\nBrooks' direction is inspired and well done. On a technical level, the black-and-white cinematography stands out, clearly designed to emulate the visual aspect of the great Frankenstein films from the 30s, with Boris Karloff. The lighting work also deserves a positive note, as does the design of the sets, costumes and props. The dialogues, sometimes improvised, work wonderfully and the jokes are excellent, even those that are a little more naughty. As for the cast, the highlight goes entirely to Gene Wilder's inspired performance, in one of the most memorable comic roles he left us. We will always remember him as Willie Wonka, that's for sure, but this film is not far behind and deserves an honorable highlight in the actor's filmography. Alongside him, we also have Marty Feldman, in his most iconic film and in an incredible performance. Peter Boyle and Cloris Leachman also deserve a note of praise."], ["Am I the only one getting bored or not? It's probably because I don't like that loud noise", "So the legendary British rockers \"Spinal Tap\" are on the comeback trail. After a dry spell in the USA, they determine to take their provocative new album and their film-faking fan \"Marty\" (Rob Reiner) and re-establish themselves as superstars. \"Marty\" has access to all aspects of their activities as he makes the ultimate fly-on-the-wall documentary depicting the ups and downs, warts and all, of this band of musicians who epitomise just about everything good, bad and excessive in the industry at which this film takes an entertaining swipe. Interspersed with some decently staged rock numbers that could easily have been seen on MTV, we are exposed to the extremes of venality and avarice, some completely bonkers lyrics and their gradual realisation that the grand stadium days are maybe long gone, now. The bickering always stays on the amiable side of toxic, but squabbles about their racy album cover being banned in Walmart, their shrinking appeal narrowed now to just to stoned-out students and their own peccadilloes deliver an enjoyably authentic looking and frequently quite funnily written analysis of life on the downward side of the showbiz mountain - and it's quite scathing of those who make a living out of it with little or no talent but a solid belief in what they see in the mirror. This is British sarcasm and irony at it's cinematic best, disguised in a faux environment that even now, after forty years, is still often laugh out loud.", "**Interesting, remarkable for its subgenre, credible\u2026 but I didn't find it funny.**\r\n\r\nI'm not a specific admirer of mockumentaries, but I recognize their value if they're funny. The film reports on the tour of a British rock band called Spinal Tap, and shows the enormous difficulties and crazy things they carry out on and off the stage. It's supposed to be a comedy... but, to be honest, it didn't make me laugh.\r\n\r\nI recognize the value that this film had for the cinematographic subgenre it launched, and the interest that the film has for cinema students and others who deepen their knowledge of the seventh art in greater detail. For me, as I'm just a guy who watches films because he likes them, it's different: it's harder to convince me to watch this a second time because of the many technical arguments they might use. Being a comedy, it has to be funny. If it doesn't, it failed as a comedy (even considering the fact that I may not be the target audience, that would just be a sign that it's not a film for me).\r\n\r\nAlthough it didn't make me laugh, I recognize that Rob Reiner does an interesting job and manages to give his film enormous authenticity on all levels. I wonder what fieldwork he did to prepare for the project, whether he spoke to journalists who follow the music industry, with bands or music artists, because in fact the film captures quite well the bizarre things that can happen on a rock tour. And the work of the main actors (Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest) is equally worthy if we consider that much of what they say is improvised at that moment, not previously written. The film looks cheap and this is perhaps even intentional: the cinematography resembles a \u201cfound-footage\u201d film, with the image shaky, poorly calibrated, full of grain at times. The sets are very good and the soundtrack, made for the film, is absolutely believable."], ["Raiders Of The Last Crusade.\r\n\r\nIndiana Jones teams up with his father to try and locate the Holy Grail. Something that the Nazis are again particularly interested in themselves. \r\n\r\nWe didn't know it at the time, but every Indiana Jones fan on the planet presumed that The Last Crusade was to be the final film to feature the intrepid archaeologist. As it turned out, another film would surface in 2008, but casting that aside (as many would like to do), Last Crusade should, and is, judged as the trilogy closer it was meant to be. \r\n\r\nIn 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition, all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two, Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period, but he needn't have worried, because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself (post Empire Of The Sun), but also Lucas (Willow) and Harrison Ford (Frantic). \r\n\r\nI mention the run up to this picture because it explains a lot on why the film is pretty much a retread of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, something that some detractors find unforgivable. Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture, with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom, Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three, but still it manages, courtesy of a sparkling casting decision, to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not, but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore. \r\n\r\nIn comes Sean Connery as Dr Jones Senior, and its the picture's trump card, because the magnificent interplay and obvious rapport with Ford (cool as a cucumber) is there for all to see. It's this what drives the film on through the more mundane and picture filler sequences, showcasing two top wily professionals with care and consideration to their craft. The casting of Alison Doody as the main female is a poor one, and one only has to look at her subsequent career post Crusade to see she wasn't up to the task here. Bonus comes in the form of the River Phoenix prologue, Phoenix as the young Indiana paves the way for the jaunty path that Crusade takes, whilst simultaneously giving us a nice little back story from which to launch the adventure. \r\n\r\nMade for $48 million, the film went on to gross $474,171,806 Worldwide, now that's a lot of people who evidently were happy with Raiders Of The Lost Ark 2! And I gleefully count myself amongst that number. 9/10", "It feels very much a retread of _Raiders_. But, that was a great movie, so it's not exactly as if that's a bad plan.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._", "Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nWhile Harrison Ford does a great job as Indiana Jones, it is always good to see Sean Connery get involved, even if he is very passive in the action. \r\n\r\nThen there is an unfortunate amount of flashback, but it is better than doing an \"Indian Jones: Origin\" movie to explain how he attained his stylish attire and phobia of snakes.\r\n\r\nThis has a quality female companion, an entertaining side character, but we're back to Nazi's again for villains.  It almost is just a highlight of the ridiculous lengths that Nazi's went to look for weird resources: the occult (\"Hellboy\"), artifacts, and investigations into alien contact.\r\n\r\nThis is a return to quality though, it takes up the more serious atmosphere of the first movie and with that concentrates on a dramatically good action adventure movie.\r\n\r\nThis is my favorite of the franchise.", "\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" adopts a change of pace probably because the filmmakers have obviously deemed \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" (1984) much too dark (and perhaps completely unpalatable in some quarters) for most audiences who thrilled at the exciting derring-do of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981). This current outing is much more audience friendly and it gets the delicate balance just right to create a heady mix of thrills and spills which results in a breathless whirlwind adventure during its action packed two hours. Steven Spielberg is certainly on tremendous form as he skillfully pieces together superbly executed action scene after action scene. He also makes extensive use of a tank in much the same way as he did the boat \"Orca\" in the blockbusting \"Jaws\" (1975) and he effortlessly finds a seemingly inexhaustible array of fresh camera angles to capture every second of the unfolding and fast moving action.", "In my view, the best of the series by a country mile. It's action-packed adventure cinema at the top of it's game. Harrison Ford and Alison Doody provide the foundations in an engaging and sexy way and allow Denholm Elliott; John Rhys-Davies, a duplicitous monkey and, of course, a series defining Sean Connery as his learned dad \"Professor Henry Jones\" with such a cheeky glint in his eye to add all the icing to a very, very good cake. John Williams provides a cracking score to complement the history and creativity of Messrs. Spielberg and Boam's words and images. We have even got a quote from Charlemagne. What's not to like?"], ["**Without ever becoming a classic, this is a film that had its own space and time.**\r\n\r\nThere are certain films that, despite being forty or fifty years old, seem to maintain all their relevance and pertinence. These films generally surpass the test of time and continue to win new audiences, generation after generation. On the other hand, there are films that are a portrait of the time in which they were made, and belong to that specific time and need to be understood in the light of that particular moment.\r\n\r\nThe plot unfolds during the Korean War, which occurred shortly after the Second World War and divided two countries that are still at war, although it is a frozen conflict. The action focuses on a mobile medical unit near the front line, where a group of doctors and nurses seek, through humor and sarcasm, to lighten the tense environment and forget the surrounding danger, ignoring and mocking their superiors. As you can see, we cannot understand the film without delving into the mentality of the 70s. At a time when American youth were shouting for peace and against the war in Vietnam, what film would make more sense than a comic parody of the army? Korea had been recent and did not have the almost sacred nature of participation in the Second World War, it was acceptable to play with that and have bearded doctors, 100% hippie style, drunk or semi-drugged, doing antics that, in real circumstances, would lead them to court-martial. If this film had been released just ten years earlier, we would have had something totally different, but this is the decade of Flower Power, of peace and love.\r\n\r\nRobert Altman provides reasonably effective direction. The recreation of the time, and the environments of the military field, is done with technical care. There was a lot of authentic war material that could be used in the design of sets and costumes, and it is quite likely that some witness told what those mobile health units were like, and what was done there. However, the script lacks unity and cohesion, and resembles a collage of comic or sarcastic episodes without much relationship between them. It was a bad script, and I can't understand how it won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. The type of humor is another additional problem: our sense of humor has changed a lot in just a few decades and our sensitivity does not let jokes in such bad taste escape like those that occasionally happen here, particularly those aimed at female characters.\r\n\r\nWhat saves the film ends up being the enormous capacity for improvisation and creativity that the cast used in the project. With less than competent screenwriters and insufficient material to build characters, the director seems to have had the intelligence to give the actors enough margin to fill in the gaps, molding the characters in their own way. This is what Donald Sutherland did, ensuring a very strong and charismatic lead. It's not even close to the actor's best, but he managed to pull it off with flying colors. Elliott Gould and Tom Skerritt follow him closely, and form a consistent core cast, with characters good enough to sustain the action. Robert Duvall, Sally Kellerman and Roger Bowen provide indispensable support.\r\n\r\nAt the time, the film was a success, as expected, and even led to a TV series. And today? Almost no one remembers anything, and to say that this is a classic seems to be a huge exaggeration. At that time, the film had a guaranteed audience. Today, with world peace declining at the expense of growing conflict between the USA, Iran, China, Russia and other powers, we can no longer call for peace without calling for the rearmament of our countries and their allies. At a time when we already live in a \u201cpre-world war\u201d environment, a film that ridicules the army has no room to flourish."], ["**The Unbearable lightness of Sex.**\r\n\r\nWhen the recently deceased Milan Kundera published \u201cThe Unbearable Lightness of Being\u201d he probably knew that the book would be both loved and hated. Based on the philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, it outlines a story full of eroticism between four characters amid the turmoil resulting from the Prague Spring in 1968, and the \u201cyears of lead\u201d that followed. What this film did was adapt the novel to the cinema, with some changes and focusing attention on the two central characters.\r\n\r\nI read the book many years ago and didn't like it. In the book, the author exposes philosophical positions taken from Nietzsche's ideas and where he privileges sex and the search for pleasure while relativizing and diminishing love. No idea could be more different from my thinking. After all, what could be more fleeting than an orgasm? In a subtle way, the book ends up proving me right: the characters live very troubled lives until the moment they find the serenity that stable feelings, such as love and friendship, can bring to each person's life. From this short review, you can already tell that I didn't like the film. I still decided to watch it due to the amount of positive opinions I heard and the presence of some big names in cinema.\r\n\r\nDirected by Philip Kaufman, the film was made almost immediately after the book was published, but the adaptation is quite weak. The film essentially focuses on one thing: sex. I shouldn't be exaggerating if I say that we can't watch thirty minutes of film without see a naked woman or a couple in the act, and the film is almost three hours long. It was something that had to be part of the film, given the content of the book, but I think there was an exaggeration on the part of the producers and screenwriters. Nudity is very present, bluntly, from all angles, which makes the film heavier. With so much attention to sordid details, the rich characterization of Kundera's characters got lost somewhere: Tereza couldn't seem more confused and Tom\u00e1s was transformed into a debauched maniac who can't see a woman in front of him and can't respect his wife.\r\n\r\nWhat about the book's political plot, in which Kundera exposes his aversion to his country's regime? The film tells us very little. The images of the Prague Spring are striking, in large part due to the superb cinematography and the way they combined archival footage with the film, and we have the feeling, from then on, that the authorities' control is suffocating, but no much more is told or revealed to us. Again, the attention is focused on nudity and sex, not on what matters in the book.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, we must highlight the performance of the cast, led by Daniel Day-Lewis and Juliette Binoche. Day-Lewis is undeniably a great actor and has immense talent, and the only thing that stops us from appreciating his performance more is the disgust for his character. Binoche, I confess, has already seemed much more interesting to me in other characters and works, but she also has enough space to shine. They also have the support of Lena Olin, Derek de Lint, and we can also count on the special participation of Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd. On a technical level, in addition to the exquisite cinematography that I have already mentioned, we also have the excellent recreation of the period, palpable in all the props, sets and costumes and an excellent soundtrack."], ["**A film that seems to be more concerned with criticizing the manners of the 19th century than with telling us a good story.**\r\n\r\nThe film is set in the early years of the 20th century and is a romantic story that begins when a young British girl stays in a guesthouse in Florence among other English tourists. The room she received does not have a view over the River Arno, so she agrees to exchange with a young man, with progressive and daring ideas, who will win her heart. When they return to England, the get-together is inevitable. I haven't read the book this film is based on, but I believe those who say the adaptation is respectful. Written by James Ivory, it won three Oscars (Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction and Best Adapted Screenplay) and was also nominated for other awards (Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Film). However, if we think about it, almost no one remembers it nowadays, except for big cinema fans.\r\n\r\nAs a romantic film, it works and fits into that clich\u00e9 of couples who break conventions to experience love, a utopia that leaves the majority of the female audience daydreaming. It's not a bad story, but we know where it will end. There is a profound anachrony underlying the film. It is not visible in the production itself, which is luxurious and expensive, with excellent sets, makeup, hairstyles, costumes and intelligently selected props. However, watching the film calmly, we detect the anachrony in the way in which British society at the time was portrayed: etiquette, good manners and social conventions appear as \u201ccastrating\u201d love and passions, when in fact few people in that society overvalued love in the same way we do. This must be in the original book, of course, but it is still a \u201cblack and white\u201d vision of a past that is judged in the light of our eyes. Despite this, it deserves clear praise for the sets, costumes and props, for its magnificent cinematography, where warm colors and the most touristic landscapes and places in Florence (one of the most beautiful in Europe) stand out, and for an excellent soundtrack, solidly based on classical and lyrical pieces that may, or may not, be recognized by the public.\r\n\r\nHowever, what stands out in the film and gives it greater value is the extraordinary performance by a luxurious cast full of strong, talented and well-known names. A very particular ovation is justified by the work of Helena Bonham Carter, in her debut in the seventh art, marking the start of her great career in cinema. Equally incredible was the chameleonic Daniel Day-Lewis, who gave us an affected and pompous gentleman who gave soul and grace. Maggie Smith is always a safe bet, especially when she plays characters within her \u201ccomfort zone\u201d, but I found her somewhat dull. Denholm Elliott is very good, but not incredible as Julian Sands, who has one of the central roles in the plot. He was one of those actors who would have done better by spending a little more time working in Europe before trying his luck in the USA. He was very good, but he lacked opportunities in the land where they supposedly appear. Allow me to make an aside: in one of those strange coincidences in life, I saw this film yesterday and just now saw, at the Oscars ceremony, this actor's name in memoriam by having passed away in 2023. What more can I say? Rest in peace."], ["**Pink Floyd's music works on its own. As a film, it's a waste of time.**\r\n\r\nI don't know if Pink Floyd were aware of the impact that \u201cThe Wall\u201d would have when they released it. Today, there is some consensus in considering it one of the best rock albums ever and \u201cAnother Brick in the Wall\u201d has become an anthem for teenage rebellion, which does not conform to the rules, dictates and conventions. And I feel free to say all this because rock is not, by any stretch of the imagination, one of my personal preference styles of music. I listen, casually, but I wouldn't pay for a ticket.\r\n\r\nWhat this film does, essentially, is to take the concept of the album \u2013 which was designed and released as if it were a kind of opera-rock \u2013 and give it a look to match in an absolutely dreamlike, hallucinated style. There is no plot other than the one that goes on in the head of the protagonist, the rock vocalist Pink, who seems to be experiencing a very deep depression, as his social and emotional isolation increases, caused by an absent father (he died in the war when he was a child), an overprotective mother, a series of abusive teachers and a recent divorce.\r\n\r\nWatching the film is like watching a musical nightmare. It's not an optimistic film, and it's not easy to watch, especially because the plot isn't very obvious and there are no explanations. There are several impactful scenes, so I don't know if it's the most suitable film for impressionable audiences. There are many fantasies about war, about power and using power to control others. There are also some good animated scenes, although they are just as disturbing as all the others. However, the film is just that... and Pink Floyd's music. The film will certainly please fans of the band, and rock lovers in general, but other audiences may think it doesn't justify their time."], ["Capra meets Serling for 1980's joyously multi genre hankie wetter.\r\n\r\nComing back to Field Of Dreams over 20 years after its release finds this particular viewer beaming with happiness that the warmth I felt way back when still washes over me in the same way. Director Phil Alden Robinson (All of Me/Fletch) manages to turn W.P. Kinsella's novel, Shoeless Joe, into a multi genre film with deep emotional heart for both sexes to latch on to. It has a beautiful mix of mythology and family values that come together to realise a dream that ultimately rewards those viewers who are prepared to open themselves up to pure fantasy with a deep emotional core.\r\n\r\nIt was nominated for best picture in 1989 because it struck a cord with so many people, it's not just the thematic heart of the film that delivers, it's also the actors on show who perfectly realise this delightful tale. Kevin Costner is surrounded by great workers in Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, Amy Madigan and Burt Lancaster, and he wisely lets these actors dominate the scenes that he shares with them, it's something that is an often forgotten good point of Costner's performances; that he is comfortable to let his co-stars dominate important narrative snatches. However, he is the glue that binds the whole film together, it's quite a naturally engaging performance that rightly gave him the star status he would achieve post release of the film.\r\n\r\nAs a born and bred Englishman I don't profess to appreciate just how much a way of life Baseball is to Americans, but I do have my own sports in England that I'm happy to dream the dream with in equal measure, and with that I understand all the themes in Field Of Dreams big time. Most of all, though, I can involve myself with its family values, the dream of dreams, and because it's undeniably pure escapist cinema for those who aren't afraid to let their respective guards down for a wee short while, the rewards are many. With a lush James Horner score evocatively layered over the top of it and John Lindley's photography almost ethereal at times, production is suitably in the fantasy realm.\r\n\r\nNever twee or over sweet, Field of Dreams is a magical movie in more ways than one. A film that manages to have its cake and eat it and then closes down with one of the most beautiful endings of the 80's.

Incredibly, \u201cShoeless\u201d Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) shows up, along with seven other members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox who were banned from the game for throwing the World Series. Ray then pursues a reclusive author (James Earl Jones) to assist him with his fantastical situation. \r\n\r\nI know respectable people who cite \u201cField of Dreams\u201d (1989) as their favorite movie and it does have some magic, along with some welcome humor and a fun road movie section, but it\u2019s burdened by the thoroughly unreal set-up, which likely would appeal to hardcore baseball fans. Still, I appreciate the message on spiritual guidance, dreams and the insouciant diligence to act on them.  \r\n      \r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in Iowa (Dyersville, Farley & Dubuque), Illinois (Galena), and Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+", "Field of Dreams is yet another movie that I originally watched a hundred years ago and recently had the chance to watch again. In my mind it was a fairly realistic story tinged with the large fantasy built into the plot involving what happens at the ball field. But that recollection was faulty; this movie is pure fantasy. That is not a criticism; I was just surprised I remembered it wrong that way.\r\n\r\nIt is an entertaining movie that effectively plays upon the heartstrings. Not just with the plot involving Kinsella\u2019s father and their fractured relationship; and with Shoeless Joe Jackson, who is perceived as a victim for accepting money for the plot that caused the Black Sox scandal and got him banished from the game, even though he didn\u2019t follow through by purposely playing poorly. What he should have done was try to talk his teammates out of it. And in a way, the presentation of pro baseball itself is a bit of a fantasy. It was obviously less mercenary a sport than it is today, but owners ruled with an iron fist, paid the players as little as possible, and traded them to other teams at will. All we see in this film is a magical fairlyland where man/children fulfill their dreams on the ball fields.\r\n\r\nI had a little trouble suspending my disbelief at the outset. Not sure why his wife after a bit of teasing swallowed his story so easily. Her support was critical, obviously, for him to continue his plan to plow his cornfield under and build a ball park. Once we accept that unlikely support, however, the rest of the fantasy elements fall into place nicely.\r\n\r\nBut it is entertaining, as I said above, and harmless fun. I am glad I watched it again, though it won\u2019t make any list of favorite movies for me.", "**A good movie to watch with the family.**\r\n\r\nIn this film, a man who has just moved to a small country house, in order to have a quieter life, begins to be disturbed by a mysterious voice that invites him to build a baseball field on a large part of his land. cultivation. That's a bad idea, because he depends on the sale of production to pay off a bank loan taken out to buy the house. However, he decides to believe his instinct. Immediately, he begins to receive visits from former players who are now dead and who, while still alive, had been removed from the competition following harsh accusations of sporting misconduct.\r\n\r\nNo, the film is not a horror film and, although the souls of the other world are very present, it is one of those delicious films to watch with the family. Here, the spiritual entities are, in fact, the nicest and kindest there can be. The script is quite good and hides a very pertinent message about the importance of family, following dreams and maintaining a good relationship with our family members.\r\n\r\nKevin Costner plays a sympathetic role that easily captivates our affection, acting very lightly in one of the most interesting cinematographic works of his life as an actor (up to the present moment). He acts with a small group of good actors, all of them committed and leaving a very positive note: Ray Liotta deserves a special mention for the way he resurrected the now dead \u201cShoeless Joe Jackson\u201d, but I also really liked James Earl Jones, in a more grumpy character. Amy Madigan does what she can, but her character is downright sidelined, while Burt Lancaster makes an honorable but brief appearance.\r\n\r\nThe film has excellent cinematography, is very colorful, is very well shot and is very light, with touches of nostalgic ambience throughout. The pace is even, and the scenes are very well inserted, so the film does not waste unnecessary time and is effective in presenting its story. The soundtrack helps a lot to build the whole atmosphere and, overall, it's another one of those discreet, quality films that is worth resurrecting for the present day."], ["A timeless classic!", "Well worth a watch, as anticipated.\r\n\r\n<em>'When Harry Met Sally\u2026'</em> is one of those films that I've heard a tonne about but without finding out anything tangible about the plot, the only thing in that regard that I knew was the Katz's Delicatessen location - not even the full scene, just the famous quote (out of context) from Estelle Reiner. Of course as a romcom drama you know mostly what you're gonna get, but this does have more to it in fairness; big fan of the time jumps, e.g.\r\n\r\nBilly Crystal is great value throughout, amusing and even touching at moments. Same goes for Meg Ryan, naturally, who I know of only by name; I never remember her face for some odd reason. Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, meanwhile, make for strong supports to the two leads.", "Were it not for the now legendary scene in the diner - and, for me, the lovely follow-up from the observing woman at the next table to the waitress, this would just be another quickly-paced, run-of-the-mill, romantic comedy that's exceedingly heavy on the dialogue. It's all about the evolution of the relationship between \"Harry\" (Billy Crystal) and \"Sally\" (Meg Ryan). They've been friends since God was a boy, but always preferred to date other people. Now clearly, as we progress through this feast of relationship mishaps, that isn't really working and they come back to their perennial question. Would them having sex ruin a beautiful friendship? The story is set across quite an extended timeframe, and that allows Rob Reiner to reset the episodic nature of the comedy and introduce new partners for us to appreciate, like and loathe as the punchline to the story becomes as obvious as the sun in the sky. The writing is witty and pithy at times, yes, but there's just way too much of it and even though there's a semblance of chemistry between Ryan and Crystal on screen, I just found the whole thing just a bit too obvious. It's not a bad watch, and I know I'm very much in the minority of opinion here, but this is really only a standard vehicle for two averagely talented stars, one of whom can \"yes, yes, yes...\" with the best of them."], ["This Seductive, Thrilling, love story has some Bite!

Some brief nudity and a HOT scene with Winona as she runs though the garden in her PJ's. Not only do I gave Bram Stoker's Dracula 5 stars, BUT I rate it in my Top 10 all-time. MUST SEE!", "The script is an unevenly good adaptation of the novel. It resolves better Dracula's aims and motivations through the love story.  Also, it provides a more understandable glue to join the 4 men chasing Dracula from a XXth century point of view and removes unimportant characters having a more \"round\" story.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to some changes certain parts are now incoherent since they were not properly adapted to the other changes. In addition, other parts are totally impossible to follow due to the amount of details only commented quickly along the movie.\r\n\r\nCostumes and general artistic work is superb but it drives the movie to some extreme stravaganza that, in the case of the actors' performances make some parts of the movie completely overacted.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think this is an iconic movie worth watching more than once.", "Although it certainly won't make you easily forget earlier interpretations of the seminal horrific character by Max Schreck, Bela Lugosi, Sir Christopher Lee or Klaus Kinski, Gary Oldman definitely finds a way under your skin. As well, the resoundingly sumptuous cinematography will sweep you off your feet--unless you're dead to begin with... =)", "Gets worse on repeat viewings. \r\n\r\nFrancis Ford Coppola's take on the Dracula legend sees Gary Oldman as the Count, who as a warrior prince returns from battle to find his true love, who after believing him to have been killed, has committed suicide. Renouncing his Christianity he pledges to return from the death to enact revenge on humanity. Century's later he is back to keep his word but becomes infatuated with Mina (Winona Ryder) who bears a resemblance to his long dead true love.\r\n\r\nForget the Bram Stoker bit, this is liberty taken wholesale, and forget any notion of this being a scary Dracula movie, for this is Gothic romance opulence. There is no doubting that as a production design goes, it's top dollar, costumes, photography, score, sets and puppetry etc, all the money is up there on the screen to please the eyes and the ears. But the narrative shift to make Dracula a tragic longing figure is a mistake, as is several casting decisions and performances. It's actually easier to say who comes out of it with credit, so step up Tom Waits as Renfield and Richard E. Grant as Dr. John Seward. Oldman is committed to the lead role, and has tortured soul down pat, but someone thought it was a good idea to make him an old ponce and stick a set of buttocks on his head! You just can't take the character seriously from the moment he appears on screen.\r\n\r\nThere's some vampire erotica as Coppola caters for the horny horror faithful, though these scenes play out like an after midnight MTV video, so not really very sexy at all. While there's a lot of fun to be had, yes you read right, with a number of scenes inserted within the dull narrative: did the great Anthony Hopkins just sniff the cheese and Keanu Reeves attempt a posh British accent? Aaargh! It should have been a Gothic classic, but clearly Coppola was out of his depth tackling such a genre. After giving myself over ten years between returning to watch the film again, I can say with confidence that it's a film that gets worse on repeat viewings. That is unless you like unintentional comedy pictures? 3/10", "Gary Oldman is super in this hammy reimagining of the tale of the legendary Count Dracula. Having lured his lawyer - the unsuspecting, and frankly rather insipid, \"Harker\" (Keanu Reeves) to his Transylvanian Castle he employs cunning and guile to use him to acquire \"Carfax Abbey\" in England. He also has designs on the young man's glamorous fianc\u00e9e \"Mina\" (Winona Ryder) and is soon set to acquire much more than just the eerie stately pile. Luckily, \"Prof. Van Helsing\" (Anthony Hopkins) is on hand to help our rather hapless hero and perhaps they can thwart the evil intentions of their vampiric visitor? Francis Ford Coppola presents us here with a highly stylised interpretation of the legend. At times it does border on the Hammer style of production with the gore and peril really unconvincing for most of the film. The heavily made up Reeves is easy enough on the eye, but his accent is tougher on the ears and his performance is more about box office than generating any sense of menace as his red-clothed nemesis marauds around in a wig Marie Antoinette would have found fitting. It does send itself up, and that works - there is plenty that is theatrical about it, and that is what helps make this iteration distinctive. Oldman looks even inch the megalomaniac as he effortlessly glides, purrs and munches his way from Romania to Victorian England. Ryder delivers well - her part has very little substance to it, yet she does rise above the all too obvious damsel in distress persona. There are also valuable supporting efforts from Richard E. Grant and the eagle eyed might spot sword and sandals veteran Jay Robinson as \"Hawkins\". Wojciech Kilar's score helps create quite an atmosphere too, especially as we enter the last half hour of against the clock drama. I didn't much care for the way the ending is portrayed but after two hours of quickly paced and colourful entertainment, that maybe didn't matter so much. This really does need big screen visuals to have any real impact, and if you can find a cinema screening then this is very much at the better end of the Dracula genre of output - even if it does play rather fast and loose with the book!"], ["Meet Max Cady, the most terrific villain role De Niro ever played simply because he successfully portrayed a crook who possesses a very complex personality of being stone-cold, violent, absolutely merciless, also on the other hand quite witty and charismatic to ever lure Danielle Bowden (Juliette Lewis) into his trap when he pretended to be her drama teacher so convincingly. Martin Scorsese\u2019s Cape Fear tells the story of a brutal rapist who waited for so long just to be able to avenge his wrath towards Attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) for he believed that Bowden could have done much better in defending for his case. This film is well-told with so many suspense elements through some shocking events throughout the film. \r\n\r\nCape Fear is one of the examples of film whose remake, in some ways, considered outwits the original one produced in 1962 starred Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck. This is quite understandable remembering the remake was filmed many years later, with sufficient advancements in technology and financial supports. In Cape Fear, De Niro managed to portray the chilling Max Cady successfully. He had a best-laid plan to avenge his disappointments/hatred towards Bowden by studying laws in prison just to be able to find the flaws that in the end shall leave him untouchable by the law. \r\n\r\nSometimes it\u2019s amazing to understand how an actor/actress willing to go through for the sake of a role. Robert De Niro paid a dentist $5,000 to make his teeth look suitably bad for the role of Max Cady whereas right after filming, he paid $20,000 to have them fixed.  De Niro migh have been spectacular in portraying Cady but we also have to consider how remarkable and superb were Peck and Mitchum.", "**A really very good movie, and proof that there are remakes that are really worth it for their quality and good execution.**\r\n\r\nI've just seen this movie (which I've actually seen on television, but without paying enough attention to a movie I want to write something about) and once again I was very impressed. The truth is that, without wanting to legitimize the practice, which is often taken to exaggeration, there are remakes that manage to justify themselves, not only for the quality they demonstrate, but also for the gift, not to mention, of drawing the public's attention to the older movies. I can give my personal example: it was the contact with some remakes that made me know that there were older films and go looking for them to be able to see them.\r\n\r\nThis film maintains, without significant changes, the story told in the older film, which dates from 1962 and was starred by Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum: very briefly, it is the story of a lawyer who finds himself persecuted and threatened, with his wife and daughter, by a spiteful ex-con who blames him for many years of incarceration. Of course, there are things that change between the two films, and this film has the advantage of not giving us a simple story where a terribly bad man wants to harm a very nice man. Bowden, the lawyer, is a man with a past full of mistakes (much like many of us) who hasn't always been good at his job and his role as a husband and father, and we see that, and the way character is called upon to face the consequences. The sexual theme, which the original film attenuates a lot (due to the restrictions imposed on cinema at the time), is also more pronounced here, transforming Max Cady into an almost perfect pervert.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the nuances that make the film denser and with a more complex story, we can count on an excellent cast where Robert De Niro steals all the attention, thanks to a powerful, convincing and genuinely menacing interpretation. This film is worth seeing just to savor the actor's performance. Nick Nolte played attorney Sam Bowden, a man who desperately seeks to protect his family. The actor is good and does a good job. Much less interesting, Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis play the lawyer's wife and daughter in an ambiguous and sometimes very unpleasant way: Lange can still reasonably extricate herself from the challenge she has, but Lewis has turned her character into a kind of teenage nymphet who sees Cady as a terrifying sexual temptation rather than having the discernment and intelligence necessary to at least realize the risk her entire family is running. Also a reminder of the cameos of honor by Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam, three actors who were pivotal in the original film. Incidentally, this film would end up being the last in the life of Peck, who died shortly after.\r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese made this film as a means to an end, that is, a way to get the studio to invest in another film he wanted to make. Anyway, and for whatever reason, it was a good bet by the director. The film deserves our attention and is full of merits. The filming work and cinematography are excellent, the sets and costumes too, with an emphasis, of course, on the scenes on the Bowden houseboat. The effects were also well done, although not particularly extraordinary. The central score of this film is the same as its older counterpart, composed by Bernard Herrmann, one of the best and best conceived by the composer, and which is already part of the collective memory.", "\"Cady\" (Robert De Niro) is released from jail after serving eighteen years for rape. He alights on the doorstep of his erstwhile defending counsel \"Bowden\" (Nick Nolte) with his cigar and his red sports car and generally starts intimidating the man and his family. Why? Well it turns out that the lawyer had buried some evidence during the trial that may have cast doubt on the voracity of the evidence given by the victim - and so now, \"Cady\" has revenge in mind. Now I loved the 1962 version of this film - Robert Mitchum is superb - and so I was always a bit sceptical about this remake. No, this honestly isn't a patch on that version, but that's as much to do with it being in colour and with it featuring the really poorly cast Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange. De Niro thrives in his element as the manipulative and genuinely odious character whilst Martin Scorsese allows the tension to increase, the sense of desperation and control to blossom and for a genuine sense of peril to develop. Hats can also go off for a strong effort from Juliette Lewis as the daughter \"Danni\" - a naive young girl whom \"Cady\" soon has in his sights. The setting for the denouement is as good as cinema can offer - an houseboat and a rainstorm - and as remakes go, this is not bad at all."], ["Possession is nine-tenths of the law.\r\n\r\nA Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge is the runt of the Elm Street litter. It was unfortunate to be the sequel to a landmark horror film, a film that birthed one of the ultimate horror icons whilst having at its core a terrifying premise. A premise that was superbly executed by all involved in the first film. Part 2 bravely tried to advance the bogeyman story to another level, to one of possession, which in hindsight was a mistake.\r\n\r\nThere's also the mixed tonal flow and confused intents that hamper the pic. Whilst the young members of the cast are too blank to garner the required amount of sympathy to get us to care about their plight, especially lead lad Mark Patton as Jesse Walsh. However, there is still a lot to like here, some striking imagery grabs the attention and it is not without some unnerving scares.\r\n\r\nThe debates about what metaphors the makers were going for still exist, and that homo-erotic sheen is never going to go away, but even though it's an average Elm Street movie, it's not as dreadful as it was first painted. 5/10", "Freddy's Revenge deserves redemption. If you don't expect a film about Freddy, you can appreciate this sequel for what it is, instead of begrudging it for what it isn't. The argument for a gay reading--the idea that Freddy is symbolic of the protagonist's repressed homosexual desires--isn't entirely convincing but even without it, the movie's a lot better than many credit it. This is a Nightmare on Elm Street story that uses the creature to explore what it feels like to grow up. It's confusing and scary and transformational. Tonal shifts and plot mistakes only contribute to the overall intent.", "The nightmare that started it all. Made us all scared to go to to sleep. My favorite horror series next to Friday the 13th.

So it was kind of dumb."], ["It takes it's time to get going this, but once we've met the characters and it gets into it's swing, its quite an amiable showcase for the star. \"Gregory\" (Jeff Bridges) is a rather dry university professor who's looking for a distinctly platonic form of female companionship. He places an add and amongst the responses is one from \"Rose\" (Barbra Streisand). Thing is, she didn't volunteer for this - her recently married sister \"Claire\" (Mimi Rogers) nominated her... Anyway, the two meet and rather surprisingly they click. A few rather rushed escapades later and it's clear that the two are falling in love - despite the obvious scepticism of her mother \"Hannah\" (Lauren Bacall) - and that \"Rose\" is now ready to takes things to a next level that \"Gregory\" is scared silly of... Meantime, her sister and husband \"Alex\" (Pierce Brosnan), upon whom \"Rose\" has always had a bit of a crush, are having difficulties and with \"Gregory\" playing his hand particularly badly, well - might \"Rose\" stray? The last forty minutes or so are well paced with some pithy dialogue and as \"Rose\" finds her true personality the characterisations begin to come alive a little better. There are a couple of fun scenes with the all too sparingly used Bacall and Streisand sabre-rattling and the rest of it, well I reckon there are some clear parallels with \"What's Up Doc?\" (1972) as the story heads to an increasingly predicable denouement. It's quite watchable, but you'll probably never remember it or the duet with Bryan Adams at the end."], ["Though I really didn't rate the story so much here, I thought the performance from Emily Watson as \"Bess\" is formidable. She lives on a remote Scottish island and is to marry oil rig worker \"Jan\" (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd). Somewhat reluctantly, the islanders embrace this and all is happy until she feels the wrench of his return to the rig. Pining for him, she regularly has conversations with God in their small kirk. It's on one such occasion that she begs him to send her husband home to her. Well, he does - but following a tragic accident that has left him completely incapacitated. She is determined to care for him at all costs, but he has other plans and convinces her that she ought to seek another lover. Somehow, she gets it into her head that every sexual act she carries out improves his condition - and so, well you can guess what she succumbs to in her quest to restore him to health. Katrin Cartridge (\"Dodo\") and Adrian Rawlins (\"Dr. Richardson\") contribute well in support as this story of a loving, immature and caring character plumbs the depths before an ending that rather summed up for me the cruelty - and implausibility - of the story. What does he actually intend for his wife - whom he clearly adores? What it also takes is an unflinching swipe at is the supposedly charitable nature of a local \"wee-free\" clergy whose behaviour towards her at the denouement is little short of disgraceful. It also asks us to consider religiosity and the medical profession (or, certainly, it's efficacy) and again I found that annoyingly unrealistic. Miracles happen? Well perhaps, but here they were the wrong kind of miracles! The film is intensively shot, the photography creative and imaginative and it all has an intimacy to it that is largely down to an excellent Watson and a illustration of a small island mentality that is almost claustrophobic but entirely enthralling testament to this director's skilful ability to provoke thought!", "**An ugly film on all levels that insults our intelligence.**\r\n\r\nFor me, cinema is an art that tells good stories, whether fictional, true or a mix of fiction and real facts. It has a clear social role, often makes people think or raises difficult questions. However, there are directors who seem to live off controversy, that is, they try to use cinema to shock or impress, attracting attention for the worst and most selfish reasons. Lars von Trier is like that: he loves a good controversy and doesn't mind about criticism, as long as they talk about him. And that's why I don't like him and I don't consider him a good director. It's not enough to have talent, you need to know how to use it.\r\n\r\nAs in many other films by this director, sex is the epicenter of this film: the script begins by introducing us to an incredibly naive and submissive woman, who lives in a kind of narrow-minded religious community in the North of Scotland. Anyone who likes to criticize Catholics for allegedly being followers of a conservatism that has no place today should get to know this Protestant religious community, where I, a conservative Catholic, would feel like I was in Iran or Afghanistan. It is clear that the director, a confessed atheist, wanted to show his horror towards religious dogmatics in general. It was a way to \u201ccaricature\u201d religion and express a personal opinion.\r\n\r\nThis young woman, whose innocence is so absolute that she would probably believe she could get pregnant just by sitting on a chair previously used by a man, marries a modern foreigner who works on an oil rig. And she discovers sex. And she loves sex, and gives herself to love. All this is beautiful until the day he suffers a serious accident. As he could lose his reproductive capacity, he asks her to meet and \u201crelieve\u201d herself with other men. Naturally, she is horrified, and he convinces her that this will help him heal. And against any rational logic, she believes, and becomes the biggest libertine in Scotland.\r\n\r\nWe have to agree on one thing: this film proves that even the stupidest story wins awards at Cannes, and that there is an audience capable of consuming the most complete idiocy that a film can present to them. In addition to ridiculing religion in a way that is offensive to any believer, I believe, the film does not care about the rationality and logic of the decisions made by the characters. If I cut myself with a knife, of course I'm going to try to make sure it doesn't happen again because it's dangerous, but what the film proposes is that I do the opposite and intentionally cut myself, believing that I'm curing a loved one's cancer by doing so. This is so stupid that it doesn't deserve qualification. Von Trier, in an act of absolute intellectual arrogance, insults our intelligence. I don't even need to talk about the clumsy and distorted way in which the film approaches love and the most genuine human feelings.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's a cheap film. Cheaper than the worst indie films. We don't have a production worthy of the name, the cinematography is horrible, the filming is so amateurish that even I could do better. The rhythm is heavy, slow, like a mournful funeral. Stellan Skarsgard, an actor I respect, lends some renown to the film and shows talent, but his character deserves contempt. In an extraordinary dramatic effort, Emily Watson deserves praise for her commitment, but it is perhaps this actress' most forgettable film."], ["_**Solid Next Generation Trek film with The Borg**_\r\n\r\nReleased in 1996 and directed by Jonathan Frakes, \"Star Trek: First Contact\" features The Next Generation characters taking on the Borg, a collection of species that have been turned into cybernetic organisms functioning as drones in a hive-mind called the Collective. In order to escape imminent destruction by the Federation, a Borg mini-ship flees back in time to 2063 to prevent the renowned Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) from accomplishing the initial warp drive and the subsequent first contact with an alien race, which later paved the way for the Federation of Planets. Alfre Woodard has a key role as a colleague of Cochrane.\r\n\r\nThe Borg are an excellent villain and one of the greatest contributions of The Next Generation TV series, along with all its elaboration on Klingon culture. Here the Borg are augmented by the introduction of a Queen (Alice Krige), which some feel detracted from the impersonal and eerie race while others think enhanced them. It makes no difference to me personally, but it fits the parallel of a queen bee in a honey bee colony. Besides, why wouldn\u2019t there be a central intelligence?\r\n\r\nThere are some gems to mine from the proceedings, like Cochrane's revelation of his carnal motivations for developing warp drive and Picard's hell-bent desire to annihilate the Borg. Speaking of Picard, Patrick Stewart carries the film with his unique star power, which is very different from Shatner, but just as effective.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, The Next Generation TV series never developed a prominent triumvirate like Kirk/Spock/McCoy, but rather a dyad, Picard and Data. Whereas this duo was core to the previous TNG film, \"Generations\" (1994) and the last one, \"Nemesis\" (2002), it's not as evident here until the last act when Picard attempts to rescue the charismatic android, but that's only because they get separated early on and Data ends up hanging out with the Borg Queen. By the way, Picard's self-sacrificial desire to save Data reveals a weakness in the script: After the Enterprise is set to self-destruct, Picard only has 15 MINUTES to rescue Data and escape the ship, but Picard is shown having a meaningful discussion with Lily (Woodard). Why sure! \r\n\r\nAnother gem of the film is the revelation of the alien race at the end, which prompts a \"Wow\" reaction to fans of Star Trek (although erudite Trekkers undoubtedly knew what was coming).\r\n\r\nThere are other flaws, like the jarring, contrived excuse for going back in time and the questionable fiery confrontation between Picard and Lily. I say \"questionable\" because something about the sequence renders it somewhat shaky; it may be the acting, the writing or some combination, but they needed to work out the kinks. Still, that scene has some good aspects, like Picard's line: \"The line must be drawn HERE!\" and the build-up to it.\r\n\r\nWhile I favor 1994's \"Generations\" to \"First Contact\" because of the fascinating story elements, e.g. the Nexus, and the potent subtext (see my review), and even marginally prefer the underrated \"Nemesis\" (2002), this doesn't take away from the fact that \"First Contact\" is a quality installment in the series, which gets better with repeat viewings despite its weaknesses.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs almost 111 minutes and was shot in the studio with location shooting at Angeles National Forest and Green Valley, Arizona (substituting for Montana).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend (at least for dedicated \"Star Trek\" fans).\r\n\r\nMy favorites aspects of all of \"Star Trek\" are The Borg, and the artificial entities like Data.  This movie potentially ruins both of them, depending on who you ask.  Also, time travel is the worst.\r\n\r\nI would have been much happier if we hadn't bothered with time travel as that creates a lot of other questions about why The Borg haven't utilized it before if they had such technology.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of humanity in The Borg and Data are pretty interesting though, seeing Data find what it is to FEEL is a great, but seeing The Borg personified into a single entity to which one can converse is odd, at best.\r\n\r\nSeeing the Enterprise defend against Borg assault was fun, but none of the \"First Contact\" stuff was compelling at all.", "Really solid and suspense-filled Star Trek film. Seen this one once before and still holds up along with the visual effects which were decent for its time. This is also the first complete TNG feature and unlike Generations, did feel like a movie rather than two-part episode. 4.0/5", "Interesting how this film divides opinion like no other from this franchise. It is my least favourite (except perhaps \"The Final Frontier\") as it does attempt to impose a morality that is well beyond the scope of the talent involved - both on screen and at the typewriter. The effects are certainly special, but even with the quirky contribution of James Cromwell I'm struggling to think of this as anything better than a longer episode of \"Next Generation\" with all of it's pseudo-intellectual idealism. Like so many films directed by and starring their stars; objectivity is sometimes first under the bus - I fear that is the case here."], ["***When a murderer is the likable protagonist, mmm-hmm***\r\n\r\nA simple, slow, seemingly pensive man (Billy Bob Thornton) is released from a mental hospital in central Arkansas after 30 years and gets a job fixing lawnmowers. He makes friends with a boy & his mother (Natalie Canerday) and they let him live in their garage, but the mother\u2019s abusive boyfriend presents a problem (Dwight Yoakam). John Ritter is on hand as the mother\u2019s gay best friend. \r\n\r\n\"Sling Blade\" (1996) is a small town drama with a memorable central character (if I didn\u2019t know beforehand that Thornton played the role, I wouldn\u2019t have recognized him). The characters and their situations smack of real life while the unhurried story is interesting enough. There are well-done moments of meditation and revelation, as well as touching ones.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a tad overlong, however, and the politically correct glorification of Vaughan (Ritter) is eye-rolling. Karl (Thornton) observes that \u201cThe Bible says two men ought not lay together. But I don't reckon the Good Lord would send anybody like you to Hades.\u201d Yet his opining doesn\u2019t mean much since he candidly acknowledges elsewhere that he doesn\u2019t understand a lot of the Scriptures, not to mention his foolish predilection for murder to solve mundane problems. He should stick to fixing lawnmowers and eating them French fried potaters, mmm-hmm.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in Benton & nearby Haskell, Arkansas, which are about 20-30 minutes southwest of Little Rock.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "**A film full of challenges, to which Billy Bob Thornton, in his greatest work, responded categorically.**\r\n\r\nI didn't really know what I was going to find when I decided to watch this film, and I'm happy about that: it's a really good, convincing and moving story, which doesn't try to escape the harsh reality of things to create unbelievable heroes. And it is probably the most solid and significant work of Billy Bob Thornton's career. In fact, he not only plays the main role, but is also responsible for the script and direction. It is a labor of love, of total and absolute commitment, which makes this film a \"Magnum Opus\", even though Thornton has done other works that are equally notable and full of talent.\r\n\r\nIn this story, we follow a seemingly kind and harmless man who has lived his entire life in a mental institution where he was imprisoned as a child, after killing his mother and her boyfriend. Now, he is a mature man, but he doesn't know anything about the outside world, he has no connections of any sort with anyone (he has a father, but there is no emotional bond between them) and he has a serious mental disability. However, doctors consider him well enough to return to a normal life. When he leaves, he returns to his homeland, where he meets a boy who is roughly the same age as he was when he was institutionalized. The friendship between the two leads him to meet his mother, a young woman who has a complicated relationship with a man with a violent nature. And despite her limitations, he quickly realizes that this man could be dangerous to his new friends.\r\n\r\nThe whole story revolves around values that are very dear to us: friendship, kindness and altruism. It's not a completely unpredictable film, but it works very well and presents a deeply credible story. After all, you only need to open a newspaper to see dozens of situations of domestic violence and dating abuse that end badly. It is a subject that deserves deep social reflection: in a world where possessive relationships are increasingly observed, it is essential to understand that love only makes sense if it is based on trust, understanding and mutual acceptance. The film also challenges us to rethink our prejudices about mentally disabled people: they have feelings and emotional needs, just like us. After all, being mentally ill does not mean that you are a psychopath or sociopath.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film presents us with excellent cinematography, in addition to a wise choice of filming locations and a careful design of the costumes and sets in Rural America. If the film is not very clear as to the geographical location where the action takes place, filming took place mostly in Arkansas, and it seems appropriate to place the fictional story somewhere between this state and its neighbor, Missouri. The well-modeled rhythm does not cause drowsiness or wear out the audience.\r\n\r\nAs I already said, it is Billy Bob Thornton who deserves the most praise for his work in the general work, and particularly as an actor. Playing dramatic roles as mentally disabled people is always challenging: there is a permanent risk of transforming the character into a caricature worthy of condemnation and offensive to people. Thornton manages to be authentic, credible in his interpretation, and reaps the fruits of this magnificent work. In addition to him, Dwight Yoakam also deserves an applause for a challenging and difficult job, in which he did wonderfully well."], [], ["A true classic. Who doesn't like this movie.

Poor Perdy squeezes out fifteen puppies, under the watchful, slumming eye of Joan Plowright, playing Nanny. Cruella returns and offers to buy the puppies. Inspired by one of Anita's designs, she plans to make a giant fur coat out of them. She and her henchmen have been collecting puppies, and these final fifteen will give her her frock. Anita and Roger do not sell. The puppies are dognapped by henchmen Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams), who look exactly like their animated counterparts from the better Disney film.

Director Stephen Herek is no Chris Columbus, however. While Columbus can direct (usually), Herek is all over the place, not quite sure what he should be capturing in order to double over the audience with laughter. The scene where Anita and Roger meet after wrecking their bikes thanks to their runaway dogs is milked for all it is worth and runs way too long. The editing is not tight, as Herek switches back and forth between multiple cameras, and capturing extreme close-ups of \"funny business\" instead of just letting the actors be funny. Daniels and Richardson get lost in the shuffle, making no impression on the audience whatsoever. Glenn Close is just right for the part, with some amazing costumes and hair, but she seems reined in as well. The film makers cannot decide if their audience is innocent children or their tired parents. Some of the dialogue is harsh, like the villains' plans for the puppies, but that is offset by sugar coating too many scenes, including the finale. There are also a couple of clips from other Disney films in the movie, but this does not seem like an inside joke so much as free advertising for other Disney videos. In the end, \"101 Dalmatians\" fails to deliver on its intent. Close almost breaks free from the shackles of marketing mediocrity, but the real loser here is the audience. The puppies are adorable, though."], ["Great fun re-watching this after checking out the original for the first time.

Willis has bags of charisma, and he needs it as he has to persuade sceptical authorities and other cops of the critical risk - and all before an incoming flight carrying his wife (with quite a fun little sub-plot of it's own) runs out of fuel. The dialogue is sometimes quite pithy, and Tom Bower is fine as \"Marvin\" (the janitor who gets roped in too). It does lack menace, maybe Willis' style of characterisation is just a bit too laid back; the smile and the glint - but it's still an end to end action thriller with plenty of pyrotechnics and near misses to fill a couple of hours in a world of mindless cinema.

This time Tim Burton was given complete creative control over the entire film, and it shows. Batman Returns cranked up the campy weirdness that the studio had restrained in the first Batman. This film focuses on Danny DeVito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman over Batman, making Michael Keaton feel like the supporting cast to Pfeiffer and DeVito. As disappointing as that may sound, Pfeiffer took this over-the-top campy Catwoman and delivered a truly iconic performance, and DeVito performed much the same in his role. I appreciated Batman Returns avoiding the comic book movie trope of putting the entire world or whole sitting at stake. Instead, the story concentrates on corrupt businessmen and politicians avoiding giant sky beams. The climax risks a more significant part of the city, but it's still more localized than most comic book films. Batman Returns has its flaws, but the Christmas setting, the return of Michael Keaton to his career-defining role, and Pfeiffer and DeVito's incredible acting overcome the severe campiness and lack of Batman, resulting in a decent entry in the Dark Knight's 90s franchise.", "The only other great batman movie. Not as much action but still was a really good movie.", "Tim Burton's original Batman definitely deserved a worthy sequel. Unfortunately, this just doesn't cut it. Keaton's Batman deserved more grit and drama, not corny comical antics. It's worth a look, but keep your expectations low."], ["If we're caught, we're gonna hang... But there's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip.\r\n\r\nYoung Guns is directed by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco. It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, Casey Siemaszko, Terry O'Quinn, Jack Palance and Terence Stamp. Music is by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli and cinematography is by Dean Semler.\r\n\r\nFilm is a telling of Billy the Kid's part in the Lincoln County War in New Mexico 1878. Plot sees the murder of John Tunstall send Billy and the rest of the Tunstall Regulators on a mission to avenge his murder.\r\n\r\nIt ain't easy having pals.\r\n\r\nOften derided by Western movie purists as a sort of MTV Western made to showcase the various talents of the then Hollywood Brat Pack of Estevez, Sheen, Sutherland et al, Young Guns is actually a far more entertaining picture than some critical assessments suggest it is. It also has some rock solid Western history footings holding it up, yes it's far from accurate in various scenarios, age of characters and numbers in gangs etc, but the core story of the Lincoln County War is there. A massive success at the box office and spawning an equally successful sequel in 1990, Young Guns zips along at pace, contains high energy action sequences and provides plenty of quotable dialogue. Best of all, though, it doesn't take itself seriously, it wants to be a rooting-tooting Western of fun endeavours, if viewed on those terms it's an absolute winner, especially since the cast are playing it that way.\r\n\r\nAlex, if you stay they're gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you. That's a lot of killing.\r\n\r\nEstevez is terrific as The Kid, blending boyish arrogance with fearless rage, a fun and scary character who is easy to get on the saddle with. Elsewhere it's a mixed bag, but apart from the disappointing Sheen, the casting decisions sit well and if you talk to ten different Young Guns fans you will most likely get a number of different answers come back as to who is their favourite Regulator (mine is Dirty Steve played by Mulroney if you are wondering?). O'Quinn is spot on as Alex McSween, Stamp adds classical tones to the ill fated John Tunstall and Palance is a neat fit as villain Lawrence Murphy. Nice to see Brian Keith get a cameo as a larger than life bounty hunter as well. Semler's photography and Cain's filming techniques are a bit too anachronistic at times and the Banks/Marinelli score too modern an accompaniment on occasions. But film rounds out as a nifty bit of Oater play for Gen X and showed that as the 1990s approached there was still love for this greatest of genres. 7.5/10", "\"Young Guns\" has wonderfully authentic production values and costumes which really brings this rugged period to life on the screen. It did seem as though the western was permanently out of fashion with mainstream audiences a couple of years before this film was released and perhaps it might never again return to the prominence it had once enjoyed, but then along came this entry in the genre and the fresh faced young talent involved each have key roles and this fact alone undoubtedly guaranteed plenty of equally fresh faced young audiences would watch. However, this film is also worthwhile for some other reasons as well. The western has always been a consistently popular genre and after watching this film you can immediately understand why. The story is a strong one and best of all the film as a whole is also incredibly well paced and intelligent and informative and these are elements you seldom encounter these days."], ["The fun kind of dumb, _Under Siege_ is probably Segal's best work, and in my opinion the only reason people ever mention him in the same breath as the likes of Stallone, Schwarzenegger or Willis.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it.

The scenario is pretty far-fetched, but to be fair to Steven Seagal as the chef with attitude, this is a fair action adventure film with plenty of combat, kitchen devil action and pyrotechnics to compensate for the pretty woeful dialogue and acting - especially from Busey - that only really works when the enthusiastic TLJ is letting loose the dogs of war. There's no jeopardy to speak of, the ending is never really in doubt - but I still find this, periodically, an enjoyable bit of machismo escapism that passes the time ok."], ["Jaws.\r\n\r\nA man eating shark is terrorising the holiday island of Amity. Police chief Martin Brody, shark hunter Quint and marine biologist Matt Hooper set sail in the hope of killing the great white monster.\r\n\r\nJaws is responsible for many things, it's responsible for propelling director Steven Spielberg's career into the stratosphere, it was responsible for a downturn in the package holiday trade, and it was responsible for shaping the summer blockbuster release practice's. There are many other things which one doesn't need to bore you with, it's just true to say that Jaws is firmly ensconced in movie history, if one hasn't seen it then one surely knows about it, it is, even today, part of popular culture.\r\n\r\nBut is it any good? Is it worthy of a long standing reputation as one of the greatest monster movies of all time? Hell yes it is, one or two easily overlooked flaws aside, it busted the box office (world wide) and tapped into a primal fear that resides in the majority of mankind, the unseen that resides in the sea.\r\n\r\nJaws sets out its marker right from the start with a truly shocking and attention grabbing opening sequence, from then on in Spielberg (learning from Hitchcock for sure) tweaks the tension to have the audience living on their nerves, even as character building (by way of Brody's family arc) sedates the pace, we just know that it's all relative to an extension of fear and terror that is around the next corner. After the first victims' remains are found, Brody glances out at the ocean, Spielberg perfectly framing the shot to say so much about what we are about to be witness' to. Jolts and shocks pop up from time to time to help build the unease, whilst Spielberg makes the audience wait before we even see what it is that so coldly and efficiently destroys man. Then it's the claustrophobic switch as our brave protagonists are out at sea on Quint's boat, unaware that the giant menace is now hunting them, eyes as black as death itself.\r\n\r\nSo many great scenes linger for all time in the memory, the entrance of Quint is a hum dinger, a mournful widow reducing Brody to a stunned realism, the Indianappolis monologue, the bigger boat! Just some of the reasons why I personally love cinema so much. The score from John Williams is as effective as any for the genre and Robert Hoyt's sound team's work furthers the unfolding dread. The cast are superb and uniformly excellent, managing to cast aside technical problems (and genuine resentments at times) to portray this story with verve and a genuine depth of feeling. Yet Roy Scheider (Brody), Robert Shaw (Quint) and Richard Dreyfuss (Hooper) were far from from original choices, Charlton Heston was wanted for the role of Brody, Sterling Hayden and Lee Marvin were both mooted for Quint, and John Voight was Spielberg's preferred choice for Hooper. Whilst Jaws author (and co screen writer here) Peter Benchley was heading for the top by asking for Newman, Redford and McQueen!! Imagine that!\r\n\r\nStill it all turned out well in the end because Jaws stands the test of time as one of the best films of its type. No amount of complaining about continuity and a rough looking mechanical shark will ever dim its appeal, even as I revisited it recently for the hundredth time I still got tingles all over my body. So file it alongside King Kong in the pantheon of Monster Movie Masterpieces. 10/10 always, now go enjoy your dip in the ocean.", "Is it safe to go back in the water? ...\r\n\r\nSteven Spielberg got ahold of the incredible Peter Benchley-penned novel about a giant, carnivorous Great White (dubbed \"Jaws\") who swims the ocean waters off a fictional resort town, preying on both the Island's locals and its visitors alike, and adaptated, for the silver screen, what would become one of the most terrifying American made thrillers to ever be released in the worldwide cinema. Exceptional filmmaking! And members of Spielberg's crew had the nerve to maliciously \"mock\" Jaws, by referring to it as \"Flaws\", during the filming process? All because of a few \"glitches\" in the mechanical shark? Ha! Who's laughing now?\r\n\r\nGreat screenwriting by Benchley and Gottlieb. Great composition by the legendary John Williams. Great direction by Spielberg. Phenomenal performances by Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss. Great supporting cast. Just...magnificent. Jaws is a magnificent film. A true classic.", "Much like the shark itself, the movie starts slowly, deep down in the depths before coming to the surface to explode in pure sensationalism.\r\n\r\nJaws is one of those rare exceptions where high-brow art meets fun entertainment. At the time of its making, however, simply keeping its head above water was the most the cast and crew were hoping for.\r\n\r\nBut Spielberg had created something special. During production, no one saw it--I'm not sure Spielberg himself saw it, but it was there. I think it was really editor Verna Fields who saw it and put it together.\r\n\r\nJaws begins the way most primal fears begin: someone is alone, in the dark, in an alien environment, and is being attacked from some unknown entity. People remark today how Jaws worked so well, that it's kept them afraid of the ocean for years. I disagree. I think it's because we are scared of the ocean is why Jaws works so well. The opening scene of the young girl being savaged in the black nothingness that is the night ocean is terrifying because it preys on primal fears; it doesn't create them.\r\n\r\nNext we're introduced to our cast of characters: There's Police Chief Martin Brody--an everyman with a fear of the water--and his wife, Ellen. There's Brody's loyal deputy Len Hendricks (mysteriously named \"Jeff\" in the sequel). Then, of course, there's the other side. There is the crooked mayor Larry Vaughan, and his two toadies newspaper editor Harry Meadows and coroner Carl Santos. After Brody and Hendricks find evidence of a hungry shark off the coast of the resort town of Amity, they do the sensible thing and start closing up the beaches. The mayor, seeing dwindling dollar signs, convinces Meadows and Santos to back him, and together they confront Brody and put the kibosh on his beach closing plan.\r\n\r\nIn an era where the primitive special effects technology gave us a shark that looked like a pool toy, it became essential that the shark not be the focal point of the film. And while a fin here and a barrel there do work wonders, it's only because the shark is far from the only villain in the movie. To have credibility, we have to have a human villain. And that is where Vaughan comes in.\r\n\r\nAfter Vaughan's cavalier \"it-can't-happen-again\" attitude blows up in his face, Brody brings in the book smart, but decidedly out-of-his-element marine biologist Matt Hooper. Hooper tells Brody everything he and we, the audience, already know: The shark is out there; it's hungry; it's eating people; and it will continue to do so unless it is killed.\r\n\r\nAfter a disastrous Fourth of July celebration that should have gotten Vaughan impeached, Brody and Hooper join forces with Quint, a grizzled fisherman with a personal vendetta against sharks. The movie then switches from its horror and drama elements and becomes something of an adventure, foreshadowing Spielberg's work on films like Raiders of the Lost Ark. Even John Williams' score begins to conjure up images of Errol Flynn-style swashbuckling. The adventure almost seems fun.\r\n\r\nAnd that is when the shark, previously only a shadow, fin, or plot point referenced by dialogue, takes center stage. The movie shifts gears further near the end, going from adventure to a full on monster movie.\r\n\r\nThe build up is slow, relying on showing us the results of the shark's presence rather than the shark itself. This creates enough fear and credibility so that by the time the big, rubbery toy shark is commanding the screen, we're afraid of it. It's already been established as a monster.\r\n\r\nThe movie's pacing, dialogue and acting are all perfect, creating a strong enough foundation on which a silly, albeit terrifying, plot rests. By the time the shark is sinking boats and eating shark cages, Spielberg has made us by into it that he could have had the shark blasting off for the moon and we would have accepted it. And that is how and why Jaws works.", "Solid shark-thriller that still holds up well with each subsequent viewings. Love the cast especially Robert Shaw and was entertained even during some of the slower moments. Not a favorite of mine or amongst Spielberg's resume, but a lot of fun. **4.25/5**", "A very good, and evidently a very influential, film from 1975.\r\n\r\nThat release year doesn't even sound correct, the film holds up extremely well in that regard - I knew already, but if I didn't and I had guessed the year I wouldn't have said anything earlier than 1990. This alone raises the film up \u00bd* for me - it's impressively made.\r\n\r\nI don't, personally, think the story is as perfect as the aforementioned. Don't get me wrong it's all entertaining, but I feel it peaks with the shark terrorising the town as a whole - when it's down to just the trio, I didn't enjoy it quite as much. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss do give notable performances, though.\r\n\r\nGoing back to my initial point, the effects for the shark are incredible. I kinda wanted to simply see more of just the shark, even if we do get more of the great white towards the conclusion. Heck, the film from the shark's prospective would've been 5*. Lastly, that John Williams score is sensational - I think every film fan, whether they've seen it or not, knows that famous theme.\r\n\r\nAlmost 47 years after its release, I've finally seen <em>'Jaws'</em>.

A marvel, really.", "I saw this recently on the big screen for the first time since I originally went as a child in 1975 and if anything, it has got better. John Williams' score and Robert Shaw's \"Quint\" combine to far outweigh the \"rubber\" shark scenes. Unlike \"The Meg\" this film conveys a real sense of tension; coupled with some good old-fashioned scariness. It also dips it's toe into the science and behaviour of an apex predator, which we may consider ourselves to be.

Otherwise it's just a good old jump in \"The Way Back Machine\" to see a litany of cameos or cheap parts by almost anyone who was famous in the mid-1990s.  Though I do feel like most of the actors I liked were essentially wasted, but it is possible that was by design so the Martians could keep the focus for the majority of the movie.\r\n\r\nRethinking on the movie almost makes me want a modernization, it has so many little quirks and nuances that really brings it to a special experience.  Even if you think it looks terrible, throw this on your queque and slot it in for a Bad Movie Night.", "**A film full of black humor, and for that very reason difficult to digest for many people.**\r\n\r\nBlack humor is doomed to be understood by very few, and this film, which is drenched in black humor from beginning to end, paid the price, becoming a minor failure. I believe that, even today, it is one of the less well-appreciated films of director Tim Burton's career, who made films considerably worse than this one.\r\n\r\nThe action takes place in the 90s and portrays a hostile Martian invasion of our planet. The US government (obviously, the other countries have virtually disappeared from the map and only France is mentioned lightly to show the total destruction of the country) is understandably tense: there are military personnel sexually aroused by the idea of using nuclear weapons against the invaders, there are scientists absolutely convinced that Martian technological superiority is reason enough to believe strongly in the good intentions of the visitors, there are politicians worried about the elections. Of course, when it comes time to showdown, the visitors get the upper hand.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best thing about this film is the strength and talent of its cast, filled with good actors who wanted to work under Burton's guidance. Jack Nicholson stands out naturally in the role of the president and does an interesting job, being well assisted by a discreet Glenn Close and a young Natalie Portman. Lisa Marie plays an unforgettable role where she doesn't have to say a single word, while Danny DeVito seems to revisit some previous characters to do his job here, which is little (but it's also true that he wasn't given much to do) . Tom Jones makes an interesting appearance. Pierce Brosnan looks like he's having fun while parodying himself. We also have good contributions from Sarah Jessica Parker, Annette Bening, Martin Short, Michael J. Fox, Rod Steiger and Jack Black.\r\n\r\nBesides, the film is a gigantic satire on the sci-fi B cinema of the 50s and 60s, where it was common to see martian invaders and visitors. The cinematography is colorful, light, and the environment is light, funny. You can feel that the film doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't want to be taken too seriously.

They think that's a bit greedy, and alight on a plan to pinch one of the babies and... Keeping that a secret proves difficult as firstly his boss \"Glen\" (Sam McMurray) and then two of his erstwhile jailbirds who have escaped from prison - \"Gale\" (John Goodman) and his brother \"Evelle\" (William Forsythe) all come to visit and conclude that this miraculous conception and the news headlines are linked! Add to the mix, the motor cycle riding, grenade carrying \"Hell Rider\" bounty hunter \"Smalls\" (Randall Cobb) who wants to track down the bairn for the $25,000 reward and we have a perilous mix of comedy and menace that works well for the first hour or so. Cage is on good form for the most part as is Hunter for maybe the first 45 minutes, thereafter though the joke really does begin to wear a bit thin and the comedy a little too puerile. The fun car chases (don't forget the nappies) are entertaining and the script is quickly paced and entertaining, but that too turns to much farce as we head to an ending that I found really quite underwhelming. There's a fun scene with Frances McDormand and the deliberations of the parole board made me smile, and all in all it is still worth a watch.", "**Another honorable addition to the Cohen Brothers' remarkable filmography.**\r\n\r\nI've seen several films by the Cohen Brothers and this one, far from being one of the most quotable when talking about them, is full of qualities that deserve note. The two brothers are known and respected for the way they create and direct cinematographic projects, giving little room for interference that would disturb the overall vision they have outlined, and actively interfering in all aspects of production. It's their film, they define the characteristics and, whether you like them or not, they are undoubtedly a talented duo.\r\n\r\nAnd being an author's work, this film follows several characteristics that are hallmarks of the two filmmakers. This is a work full of irreverence, where the narrative stands out for its bizarreness and sarcasm, intelligently constructed and crafted in a way that surprises the audience. The story is simple: a couple, who meet and fall in love under the most unorthodox conditions, discover that they cannot have children and, therefore, decide to kidnap a baby from a family that had quintuplets. There is an entire history of crime in the life of one of the couple's members that contributes to them being the target of a brutal chase by a wild bounty hunter. And there are many moments of acidic and difficult-to-digest humor. Added to this is the cinematography and soundtrack, where the Cohens are completely at ease. Personally, I must say, I didn't really like the soundtrack that was used in this film. I found it excessively intrusive and strident, but this is just my personal taste.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the artistic and author notes, the film also features a skilled cast where Nicholas Cage has plenty of space and material to shine. He is charismatic enough to give his character all the sympathy he needs to captivate us, and he makes a good romantic pair with Holly Hunter, who received a character tailored to her abilities and talent. The two actors have everything it takes to do an exceptional job, and there is no doubt that they won't leave us disappointed. Trey Wilson, Frances McDormand, John Goodman and Randall Tex Cobb join the project, with all their talent, to shine with very well-made secondary characters."], ["A great night in with a top cast having fun.\r\n\r\n\"I could have joined the NSA but they found out my parents were married!\" \r\n\r\nThe DVD box proudly proclaims that the film is one of the most satisfying suspense films ever! Naturally this is hyperbole from the marketing department, but it's stuff like that that can make or break the chance of a viewers expectation level being achieved.\r\n\r\nI opened this write up with a funny line spoken by Robert Redford because having just finished the film I feel all jolly, and that is a priceless thing after watching one of the most suspenseful films ever! (groan). This film is a multi genre offering, it has pretty much most bases covered and features a cast of actors from different eras clearly enjoying the work that they are doing. There is no earth shattering twists or performances to match, it's a tight and intelligent script that's written to provide two hours of pure entertainment. It does have suspense, and it does make you think about how technology can be an incredible tool/weapon, but chiefly the film is one that you all can watch during a night in and be safe in the knowledge that your rental or TV time hasn't been wasted. 7.5/10\r\n\r\nFootnote: The ending is fabulous, I really should go for a higher rating purely for the incredulous looks that James Earl Jones gives as the final reel draws to a close."], [], [], [], [], [], ["On the face of it, two A-list men at the top of the bill should have made this compelling, but sadly what we get is a rather lacklustre thriller that is positively lacking in thrills! The story centres around police officer \"O'Meara\" (Harrison Ford) who takes in an Irish lodger \"Devaney\" (Brad Pitt and his hilarious Irish accent). From the outset, we are aware that the lodger is really an IRA terrorist who is hiding out under an assumed name, and gradually his host begins to suspect that all is not what is seems. What now ensues is a really rather poorly constructed story that leaves breadcrumbs for us all to follow to an ending that though taut at times along the way, is really nothing very interesting. As a Brit, I've always found these intrigue films that portray terrorists as glorified freedom fighters a bit tough to stomach and the narrative here plays to just about every dumb stereotype imaginable. There is precious little by way of action and the pace sort of lumbers along with little to engage the little grey cells. The plot is overly simplistic and from a political perspective, totally one-sided and that renders the whole thing little better than an hollow outing for both. Though Pitt is at his most eye-catching, this is nothing at all to write home about and offers us little of meaning to help comprehend the complexities of the true problems on the island of Ireland."], ["Pretty dumb movie. I was expecting this moving to be funny. It wasn't. This moving is very boring. Nothing exciting or interesting about it.", "**A somewhat one-dimensional comedy that is based on uncomfortable dialogues and situations.**\r\n\r\nI didn't really know what I was going to find when I sat down to watch this film, directed and written by Kevin Smith (who also appears in the film, in a minor role, his famous \u201cSilent Bob\u201d), who we know best for his participation in the \u201cClerks\u201d movies. When I finished, I felt moderately satisfied, even though I consider the film forgettable.\r\n\r\nThe plot is based on an unlikely romance between two very different people: Holden is a comic book artist who lives and works with his best friend, Banky. Being a conservative and conventional man, he is confused when he falls in love with Alyssa, a liberal and sexually experienced woman, who says she is a lesbian, but who does not give up having sex with men when she feels like it. The romance will cause mutual discomfort and will lead Banky to try to \u201cprotect\u201d Holden from that woman, who is so different from them.\r\n\r\nCreating a romantic comedy in which a conventional and conservative man gets involved with a clearly more liberal and experienced woman is a good idea, but the film stops there and doesn't go much further than the tension created around it. The characters are poorly developed and are limited to \u201csymbolizing\u201d incompatible ways of experiencing sexuality. We never know more about them and their motivations or thoughts, and the film is not very effective in the way it tries to create comical situations around this. Thinking about the subject, I believe that the funniest dialogues are those of Banky, who shows from an early age that his character is spontaneous and prone to saying things that shouldn't be said.\r\n\r\nWith a poorly developed script, situations whose joke never exceeds the average and production values that also do not surprise or exceed the \u201cstandard\u201d, the strongest point of this film ends up being, in my opinion, the work of the main cast, in particular Ben Affleck, Jason Lee and Joey Lauren Adams. Affleck, especially, is superb in the way he brings his character to life. One could hardly give more strength and credibility to that character. Lee is equally good, in that he can be funny, even if he is one-dimensional. Joey Adams does a very good job, and it's strange to see how this film didn't contribute much to the growth of his career."], [], [], ["**It's a reference film, although it's not exactly my cup of tea.**\r\n\r\nWell, first of all, I have to acknowledge the impact and popularity of this film, not just at the time it came out, but even today. It was one of the great successes of the time (except for the United Kingdom, shaken by the death of Diana Spencer, and where the film only later, on physical support, came to gain popularity). It is one of the most popular comedies of the late 20th century and was instrumental in consolidating and expanding Mike Myers' career. However, I don't think it's exactly\u2026 my cup of tea. And I will explain why.\r\n\r\nThe script is, basically, a parody of the James Bond films\u2026 Austin Powers is a flamboyant and liberal spy who is described as the man all women want and all men want to copy. This is hilarious because the character is ugly, kitschy and has the manners of a deeply misogynistic sexual pervert. Nothing against it, I'm not a fan of political correctness. What really bothers me about this movie is the total absence of funny jokes and the emphasis on the sex theme. Almost all jokes have a sexual connotation, and this proved not only ineffective but tiresome.\r\n\r\nThe plot is simple: in the Sixties, Powers fails in his attempt to neutralize his greatest enemy, Dr. Evil, when he escapes and freezes himself in a cryogenic capsule. In order not to be left behind, the spy offers to go through it, being frozen until the day his enemy returns, which happens in the late 90's. From here, a whole sub-plot is generated in which both characters, in their own way, will have to adapt to the new period as they prepare for the final confrontation.\r\n\r\nMyers is the driving force of the entire film, taking on the skin of two of the important characters: the hero and the villain. This is not something new in cinema and has already been carried out by Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness, two references that Myers took into account in his work. And even though I didn't really like the film, it wouldn't be right of me if I refrained from praising this actor, and his ability and commitment. Elizabeth Hurley played a spy, daughter of a former colleague of the protagonist, being the \"Powers-Girl\" in this film. She is good enough for the task and does a pleasant job.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film does what it needs. A regular cinematography with good colors and sharpness, a very pleasant rhythm and no dead moments. I liked the props and the sets, especially Powers' car (a classic Jaguar). His costume, clearly inspired by 18th century clothing, also seemed creative and original to me, although I have some difficulty in finding any credible basis for this option in the fashions and aesthetics of the 60s. Finally, a note of praise for the very good soundtrack and, in particular, for the lively dance sequence that accompanies the opening credits.", "I know this is a very popular movie. It's just a little to weird of a comedy for my liking."], ["This movie is one of the best movies of all time! It has a great story lines and graphics of it's time and even to today's standards it is brilliant. The world is well though out and well demonstrated. Zorg is a great bad guy, played by Gary Oldman and Bruce Willis plays his role very well. All in all a excellent movie.", "A simple enough concept: Guy must save a World (in the Future!) from Evil! by protecting a Magical Macguffin, only in this case it\u2019s a Girl! instead of a Thing.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s really not a lot of story here. Not a lot of character either. Why waste valuable screen time with such paltry concerns when you can instead have Chris Tucker prancing around as a flamboyant radio host in the most annoying cinematic sci-fi supporting character not created by George Lucas? Instead, the film casts actors who do a fair job of acting simply by being themselves: Bruce Wills is Korben Dallas, a brawny, shoot-first hero who, when the chips are down, is brawny and shoot-firsty. The Magical Girlfriend MacGuffin, Leeloo, is played by Mila Jovovich (in her breakout performance) and some strategically-placed wrappings (the wrappings have had a harder time breaking into more mainstream roles). Ian Holm turns up as the Old Mentor, and filling out the cast is Gary Oldman as the antagonist Zord (in his hammiest role ever).\r\n\r\nThe film seriously rises to the level of made-for-SciFi Channel-original and no higher. The plot is nonsensical, the acting committed but laughable, and the dialogue so stiff you\u2019d think the script pages had been starched.\r\n\r\nSo where does the film go legitimately wrong? Two main places: first, Besson carries on the proud tradition of French filmmakers doing weird things solely for the sake of being weird. The entire film is filled to the brim with the kind of idiosyncratic touches that I\u2019ve come to expect from that region. Most of the bits don\u2019t work, but I\u2019ll give them credit for keeping things interesting.\r\n\r\nThe second, more serious issue is another that seems to plague genre French directors, and that\u2019s the whole matter being played (largely) for farce. The most successful (creatively) American (sci-fi/)action films are defined in very large part by their villain. This film, like so many other sci-fi/action films I\u2019ve seen from French directors, never establish or maintain an element of power for the villains over the heroes. The villains are painted as clueless, moronic, out of their depth, or outright incompetent. That tradition continues here. What would Star Wars be without Darth Vader? Die Hard without Hans Gruber? Aliens without\u2026uh, aliens?\r\n\r\nLacking a strong (or even memorable) central villain (we have two: a Gary Oldman so hammy I\u2019m pretty sure Muslims couldn\u2019t work on the film, and the other being a giant planet-size ball of\u2026Pure!Evil! No joke.), the film sacrifices the one shot it had at having some kind of weight or dimension. There\u2019s no sense of danger or peril, no chance that the Hero won\u2019t triumph, and [spoilers!] the day is essentially saved by a Care Bear stare.\r\n\r\nSo, does what I\u2019ve just said make it bad? Well, yes. Let\u2019s try again. Does that made it unenjoyable? No, and it\u2019s an important distinction to make. The film is an interesting curiosity. After a half-hour of the bizarre, if you can let yourself be swept into its idiosyncratic world you\u2019ll find a perfectly watchable B (or C)-movie. It rankles a bit to think about how much was wasted making dreck this dreck-y, but it\u2019s entertaining dreck.", "Ever since I first watched The Fifth Element in the late 90s, I've been inspired by Gary Oldman's Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I strongly recommend you make the time._", "Negative, I am a meat Popsicle.  \r\n\r\nIt's 2259 and the Earth is in mortal danger from pure evil. The only hope Earth has is something called the fifth element, which comes in the form of the newly cloned Leeloo. Along with an ex forces cab driver and a priest called Cornellius, Leeloo must piece it together before the end of mankind arrives.\r\n\r\nDepending on which side of the fence you sit on, The Fifth Element is either a child fantasy made by an adult, or an adult fantasy made by a child! Here in lies the problem that many critics and movie watchers can't agree on. Just what does Luc Besson's film want to be? Having conceived the concept for his film at a very early age, Besson I think waited until he was comfortable with his adult eyes, and armed with the technological advancements in the late 90s, to realise his vision. With the result being a beautiful piece of science fiction that is, yes- cartoonish in every other frame.\r\n\r\nCrucial though is that Besson's futuristic vision of New York dominates proceedings, not even a villain overdrive from Gary Oldman can detract from the colourful vistas that Besson has crafted. The sea has dropped and New York is awash with flying cars, there are no take aways anymore, the Chinese junks fly to your front door to serve you food, how cool is that? Shape shifting aliens are amongst us, who in the context of this Jean-Paul Gautier clothed universe, blend in effortlessly, and opera divas are strangely beautiful and blue creatures. In short, the film is an art direction treat, a feast for the eyes, even as the comedy and action take control in the final third.\r\n\r\nBruce Willis quickly leaves behind his successful trip to harder edged roles (Twelve Monkeys) to play super cabbie Korben Dallas. Gun toting and with a quip at every turn, this is the Willis that the MTV generation loves and adores. Oldman, for better or worse as Zorg, gives a memorable performance (oh my, is that a Southern American accent?), but it's with Mila Jovovich (Leeloo) that the film gets its acting spurs. A pure revelation, it begs the question on why Jovovich has failed to progress in the acting world? (stop doing tripe like Resident \"will work for food\" Evil films would be a good start).\r\n\r\nSci-fi fans will obviously get the point that the support cast features Ian Holm (Alien) and Brion James (Blade Runner), which off sets the annoying and painful turn from Chris Tucker as zany, insecure DJ Ruby Rhod (is Besson having a pop at world DJs here I wonder?). To leave us with what? A film that mildly suffers from its director giving way to his heart over his head, but hey baby, it's one groovy and enjoyable romp from start to finish regardless. 8/10", "\"The Fifth Element\" is like a journey down memory lane for me, brimming with nostalgia. I've lost count of how many times I've caught it on TV. The cast was on point, the makeup and costumes were seriously cool, and those futuristic locations were quite intriguing.\r\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, \"The Fifth Element\" is a certified classic. It possesses that timeless quality that's hard to find. I'd easily give it a solid 9 out of 10. But if you're a fan of this movie, you should definitely check out the animated film \"Heavy Metal\" (1981), which served as inspiration for many animation and science fiction films, including this one.", "I wonder how many taxi drivers get a fare they wish they's just driven past! Well I think poor \"Dallas\" (Bruce Willis) might have wished he had done that with the almost mannequin-esque \"Leeloo\" (Milla Jovovich) as he finds himself embroiled in a plot to conquer the planet. She speaks in syllables that wouldn't have been out of place in an edition of \"The Clangers\" but still manages to convey the sense of peril to mankind well enough for him to try to track down the priest \"Cornelius\" (Ian Holm) who might be able to locate some sacred stones that belong to the benign \"Fifth Element\" in time to save us from \"Mangalores\" and his evil henchman \"Mr. Zorg\" (Gary Oldman). of course, we soon learn that \"Dallas\" is no ordinary, pie-eating, cabbie. He is a former special forces ninja who is no stranger to an Uzi 9mm or to some nimble fisticuffs. Luc Besson manages to integrate some engaging comedy threat into a decent sci-fi adventure that raises a smile. Willis offers his usual style of charismatic, slightly sarcastic, delivery and Oldman (well, more his hairdo, really) camps up nicely as the baddie in charge of an army of alien soldiers who couldn't hit a cow on the tit with a tin cup. There's loads of action pretty much from the start as somehow we just know that Bruce is going to come through for us.

It stars Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, Richard Schiff, Peter Stormare, Vanessa Lee Chester, Arliss Howard and Harvey Jason. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography by Janusz Kami\u0144ski.\r\n\r\nFour years on from the horrors of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, it transpires that there is a second dinosaur site on Isla Sornar. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) is forced to head off to face the horrors once again when he learns that his paleontologist girlfriend, Sara Harding (Moore), is already on the island as a forerunner to a team John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is assembling to document the dinosaurs in their habitat. Once there, though, the problems soon arise, especially when a team from InGen arrive with other ideas about the dinosaurs on their minds.\r\n\r\nGiven the massive success of Jurassic Park in 1993, a sequel was inevitable. What transpires is pretty much more of the same, it's very safe film making by Spielberg. Coming off of the emotional exertions of his last film, Schindler's List, few can deny that the director was entitled to wind down with The Lost World project, there was after all nothing safe about Schindler's, but although Jurassic 2 is a hugely enjoyable family blockbuster, a jazzy bit of hi-tech fun, it lacks the requisite brains to make it an inspiring sequel.\r\n\r\nFormula follows the same path, humans in peril on the island, with some added and new dinosaurs (double T-Rex a bonus), and then the \"twist\" in the narrative sees some monster peril come to San Diego, King Kong style, for the finale. There's inter fighting between the good dudes led by Malcolm and the bad guys led by the weasel Peter Ludlow (Howard) who is Hammond's conniving nephew and current head of InGen. Family issues also feature, of course since this is Spielberg after all, while the dangers of tampering with science message remains as strong as ever.\r\n\r\nCast are ably led by a witty Goldblum, who is a reassuring presence carried over from the first film, and the tech-credits are as expected, very high. Some scenes soar, such as a sequence shot from under a pane of glass that starts to crack under the weight of a character, others not so, such as having Malcolm's teenage daughter turn into Nadia Com\u0103neci for one credulity stretching scene. But all told it's an honest blockbuster purely aimed at the target audience who helped to see it make over $600 million in profit. Safe often pays you see, and as sequels go it's one of the better ones in the 90s. It's exciting if intellectually stunted. 7/10", "MORE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/\r\n\r\nThe Lost World definitely didn't deserve its originally bad reception. Sure, it's far from the incredible 1993's Jurassic Park. Less interesting character arcs and overall (silly) story.\r\n\r\nHowever, it remains fun enough with equally memorable dinosaur sequences. Goldblum rocks.\r\n\r\nRating: B-", "I feel I should point out that my overall positive review is based on entertainment value and not at all on scientific accuracy and the like.\r\n\r\nThis sequel mirrors a few of the winning elements from the successful first movie: they retain Ian Malcolm, who is one of the highlights of the first film; they bring in a child, because it is much more dramatic to endanger children; they have at least one bad guy who we root for to become Dino-dinner; and there are plenty of action sequences with heart-stopping chases and hair-raising escapes. Several of the great one-liners are again given to Ian. My favorite line for all the Jurassic movies occurs early on. After they watch the cute Triceratops herd pass closely by them, Ian says, \u201cWell yeah, ooh and ahh; that\u2019s how it always starts, but then later there is running and then screaming.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd four years after the first movie, they have learned one thing from other action films: increasing the body count. Why kill of a handful of people when you can easily send a large team in to capture the dinosaurs and start picking them off one at a time? They even have a T-Rex wandering the streets of San Diego like King Kong at the end. So it sticks to the formula with a few variances and is entertaining.", "Now they are trying to recover from the devastation that happened from the 1st one.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park sucks on so many levels.\r\n\r\nI had Jurassic Park 1 on repeat for nearly 24 hours and every time I sat down I had a laugh or a feeling of awe or excitement. Jurassic Park 1 is truly a marvel. Apart from the squealing, the characters are well written and well acted. The casting is amazing, even the kids, and it's so WOKE I oughta give it a 10/10. _Actually, I think I will._\r\n\r\nThis time around it's all trash.\r\n\r\nMalcolm returns but the off-putting charisma that made him \"beloved\" is dulled. The kids return for a cameo but get replaced by Malcolm's daughter who... exists like Stacker Pentecost's son apparently exits in Pacific Rim. She does basically nothing for the majority of the movie. I'm not one to hate on kids unless they're insufferable but she kinda embodies the reaction I had throughout this movie, which is \"this is pointless\". Pointless movie, nothing happens, sure some folks get nommed but no one cares because they're all kinda stupid and useless except for the first guy who gets nommed _who I'm almost certain mentioned the Rexes left the area_.\r\n\r\nI've never seen Julianne Moore smile so much. Her character, Sarah, is fine up until Sarah and Nick do the \"no good deed\" _with a lot of unnecessary stupid_ that results in the events of this movie.\r\n\r\nUnlike the normal fare, I don't have an issue with women or feminism so her little quip about not needing Malcolm to save her at the start of the movie before everything goes awry doesn't phase me. She went there not expecting events to unfold the way they did, and by events I mean Ludlow.\r\n\r\nAnyway, back on topic. There isn't much else to say except just re-watch Jurassic Park 1 five times and you'll likely have a better time than watching any of the five sequels.\r\n\r\nP.S.: Can anyone explain the ship? Anyone at all? I know what the script says was supposed to happen but that's not what we get in the movie and the movie makes no sense whatsoever.\r\n\r\n4/10 is too generous for this trash.

The thing about films that showcase the male body quite this much is that after a while you start wondering why blokes with perfect physiques and faces always seem to have such an underwhelming payload down below! Anyway, the young \"Nagiko\" (Vivian Wu) recalls the memories from her childhood when her father used to paint some delicately elegant calligraphy on her face. These perfectly crafted characters - and some accompanying and wonderfully enigmatic stories, all emanated from the works of a lady-in-waiting at the 10th century Heian court in Japan. Subsequently, as an adult she is fascinated by this form of art, and with painting the bodies of those who share her rather lively sex life. \"Jerome\" (Ewan McGregor) has slovenly hand-writing that drives her mad, but soon they are enthralled with each other and he becomes one of the the more willing partners joining in with her games of sex and scribe-work. There's no doubt that some of the body work she creates would be the envy of many a modern day tattooist. Now there's got to be a twist - and soon she discovers that \"Jerome\" likes his oysters and his snails - and that he is having a dalliance with a publisher who made life difficult for her father. She sees an opportunity to not just get even, but to get her own book out there too. The presentation, like the book, is delivered in chapters. That's not always the easiest to follow, nor are they in anyway chronological - the narrative has a rather rambling mind of it's own sometimes and that does undermine the literary value of this leaving us with a story that does jar occasionally. Essentially, in the end it's a gorgeously photographed aesthetic that works well sometimes, not so well others. It's not a great story, but it's a creative and visionary look at the beauty of the male body - and personality - as seen through a woman with love, lust and revenge in her eyes.

Taken under the wing of The League Of Shadows, a deadly ninja assassin army devoted to erasing crime with their own brand of harsh justice. After completing training, Wayne refuses to join them on account of not agreeing with their methods, he returns to Gotham City to reek his own one man war against crime.\r\n\r\nDirector Christopher Nolan literally goes back to Batman origins to not just give the dead franchise a kiss of life, but actually to spark it into a sort of triumphant homecoming. Gone is all forms of camp veneer so evident in Joel Schumacher's offerings, and in place we have a darkly rich picture intent on fleshing out Batman's motives, and crucially, his fractured persona.\r\n\r\nOne of the most pleasing things to me was that Nolan paced this picture to perfection, the build up of character, and then birth of the Bat, dominates for practically the first hour of the piece. This gives Batman Begins some crucial heart, it really helps us to focus on this weird super-hero now that we have some meat on his bones. We then follow Wayne from a Chinese prison to The League Of Shadows monastery, watching his transformation from brawling man of anger into a controlled fighting machine. A machine that still roams with a revenge laden heart.\r\n\r\nThen its to Gotham City where he then births Batman and all bad guys are on his agenda. Mob boss Falcone, the mysterious Scarecrow, and also a face from his past that rears its surprising head. Wayne is driven by powerful motives, and it's here in the second part of the film that Batman Begins rewards those who indulged in the character build up. In come the stunts and outrageous sequences, all played out in Nolan's desperately dank Gotham City (a far cry from Tim Burton's dark Oz like scapes). This Gotham is pot boiling to disaster and is crying out for the Bat to sweep all before it, and thankfully Nolan and his cast fulfil all the early promise to deliver a wonderful action fantasy that caters for all ages.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale dons the Batsuit and it fits like a glove, his Bruce Wayne may lack the ebullient charisma that Michael Keaton's had, but his Batman is mean and moody and comfortable with the zippy dialogue. Michael Caine plays Alfred the loyal servant to the Wayne family, much heart and emotive drive from Caine ensures the role is a roaring success. Cillian Murphy is Dr Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow who actually scares more as Crane with his piercing eyes and devilishly smirky leer, whilst both Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon) & Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) are solid with what little they actually have to do. Liam Neeson gets his teeth into a meaty role as Henri Ducard, and as a character arc he gets the best scenes (Nolan clearly having great fun here).\r\n\r\nMinnor let downs to me without hurting the picture are Katie Holmes (pretty but hardly convincing as Assistant D.A. Rachael Dawes) and Rutger Hauer as Earle (a little bit of menace wouldn't go amiss here Rutger old man). Still, as I said they are very minor let downs because as comic book adaptations go, Batman Begins is from the top draw, a franchise re-suited, rebooted and completely reinvigorated. But now the test comes with that all important sequel... 9/10", "i'm beginning to think people only say a movie is good because of it being long and having a good camera. to me the only highlight was cillian murphy's performance. the rest of this was just some dumb, boring trek.", "Christopher Nolan's \"Batman Begins\" shows us exactly how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) transforms into the caped crusader we all know and love, Batman. Admittedly like many others, even though this is the first entry in the Dark Knight Trilogy, I watched it is as my last one, and that is due to me not even knowing of it's existence, which is thanks to it being heavily overshadowed by the critically acclaimed sequel, \"The Dark Knight.\"\r\n\r\nBatman Begins has a simple plot to follow full of twists. A young Bruce Wayne travels to the Far East, where he's trained in the martial arts by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the mysterious League of Shadows. Ducard later reveals the true purpose of the League, the complete destruction of Gotham City as they feel it is an unjust cesspool full of criminals that is too far gone to be saved and must be cleansed to preserve their duty and for justice and balance to be restored. Bruce does not agree with the League's morals and returns to Gotham on his own determined to clean up the crime-ridden and corrupted city without resorting to murder. With the help of his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a tech expert at Wayne Enterprises, Batman is born.\r\n\r\nThe number one takeaway from this film that I did not experience as much in any other Batman movie, was that it really makes you care and feel compassion towards Bruce Wayne himself, not the masked vigilante he disguises himself as. The real Bruce is tragic, realistic, relatable, quite unstable, and frankly doesn't know what his purpose is or what he should be doing with himself. This is the origin story, and you get to first hand see the traumatic events that turned him into the lonely, guilt ridden bitter man you see today. His feelings and actions are completely justified, and I've gained a lot of respect for the character.\r\n\r\nNow this is a dark, gritty and mature film clearly made for adult fans, do not expect the colorful, campy comic book styled \"Joel Schumacher\" treatment here, this is going to get real, real fast. I can and do appreciate the attempt to not be a generic superhero film and head towards the crime drama genre, and don't get me wrong it's a great movie, but there a few issues that keep it from being perfect movie status like the sequel in my books. It was maybe a bit too serious for it's own good, and ends up being so focused on becoming an art piece that it almost stops being fun. Primary antagonist Ra's al Ghul is great, but secondary villain Dr. Crane a.k.a. Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) has an apparent lack of quality visual effects and proper screen time. The long run time was not wasted, but they probably did not need to include so many side characters, world building and lore into what could have been a quicker, neat, well done origin story.\r\n\r\nOverall I liked and can get behind Batman Begins, I do not think it's the best in the \"Dark Knight Trilogy,\" but it's a top quality film on it's own accord especially if I stop comparing too much. This film delivers a uniquely cold, cruel, and memorable experience that will make you see and appreciate Bruce Wayne and his Batman persona from a completely new perspective.", "\u2018Batman Begins\u2019 is a strong introduction to the Batman thanks to the magnificent cast and a superb score by Zimmer and Newton Howard.\r\n\r\n9/10", "Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale are at the top of their games with this enthralling interpretation of just how \"Batman\" came to be. \"Bruce\", the young sone of the billionaire \"Wayne\" family finds himself unexpectedly orphaned and is soon aimlessly bumming his way around Asia. It's when he encounters \"Ducard\" (Liam Neeson) and is lured high into the Himalayan mountains that he is set to training by the legendary Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) so that he can join the \"League of Shadows\" - an uniquely skilled ninja-esque group of elite warriors. He plans to use his training to return to the largely lawless Gotham City and act as a force for good. Soon, though, he learns that all in his highland sanctuary is not what it seems and after a battle royale, finds himself back at his manor house with his faithful retainer \"Alfred\" (Sir Michael Caine) and at the helm of his company - just as it is about to be sold by \"Earle\" (Rutger Hauer) making him an even more immensely wealthy man. His scientific guru - a sort of equivalent of \"Q\" - is \"Lucius Fox\" (Morgan Freeman) and together with the like-minded police officer \"Gordon\" (Gary Oldman) they set about taking down the city's kingpin \"Falcone\" (Tom Wilkinson) before he can contaminate the water supply with an opiate that will bring wholesale fear and destruction. This is a cracking action adventure film that rarely has a dull moment. Nolan and accomplished writer David S. Goyer take this character by the scruff of the neck and it really works. No more silly thwacks and pows; this is a dark and gritty tale of corruption, jealousy and revenge that is superbly photographed and has gadgets galore. I did struggle with Wilkinson, to be honest - he has all the menace of a wet cabbage; and Katie Holmes's \"Rachel\", though providing additional humanity, sadly offers little as this plots twists and turns like a cobra on steroids. Certainly never my favourite super-hero, \"Batman\", but this is certainly up there as one of my favourite superhero films. No laser eyes or magnetic powers; just a decent man with vengeance on his mind.", "**Batman Begins opened the door for the new age of superhero cinema with its realistic, grounded approach and excellent quality.**\r\n\r\nMany may not realize the groundbreaking impact Batman Begins had on the superhero genre. While Spider-man and X-Men were popular films, many still rejected comic book films as only for kids. Incredibly cheesy films like Catwoman and Batman + Robin didn\u2019t help make the more grown-up audiences have much faith in the genre. But Batman Begins changed all that. Batman was stripped of all the goofy comic book shtick and thrust into a gritty real world that spent time developing the character and making a rich man dressed like a bat and jumping off of buildings suddenly seem not just possible but awesome. Nolan\u2019s serious and dark aesthetics and tone changed the landscape of superhero films and paved the way for the soon-to-come Marvel universe. With a brilliant director like Christopher Nolan and a cast boasting Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman, the film carried a weight and quality that was new and fresh for comic book films and signaled the beginning of a new era for superhero movies.", "It was a nice change to see for a batman series of movies that were going down hill. This movie was ok but at least it's not as bad as the ones that were being made before this.", "A very self-involved and glum Batman. Not my favourite.

Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "_**Fun sci-fi comedy with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith**_\r\n\r\nAn athletic New York City police officer (Will Smith) joins a shadowy government organization that deals with extraterrestrial interactions on Earth. Tommy Lee Jones plays his senior partner, Rip Torn the head of the agency, Vincent D'Onofrio a possessed hick and Linda Fiorentino an attractive coronor. \r\n\r\n\"Men in Black\" (1997) is wildly amusing in the first half, but loses its energy a bit in the last act. Nevertheless, it fills the bill for when you\u2019re in the mood for fun & thrilling popcorn entertainment. It inspired three sequels as of this date: \u201cMen in Black II\u201d (2002), \u201cMen in Black 3\u201d (2012) and \u201cMen in Black: International\u201d (2019) with the last one being the only movie in the series without Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in New York City & surrounding area (e.g. Jersey City), as well as Semi Valley, CA (the saucer crash sequence) and nearby Los Angeles/Culver City.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis was a better movie historically than actually.  It at least felt like it introduced some concepts of having aliens infiltrated Terra into the industry, even if it didn't actually.  Maybe it popularized it more, but it was very good at walking the audience across that line that separates our normal Terran view to that of an integrated society.  Or maybe I just love the concept of aliens on our planet that much.\r\n\r\nI definitely don't think it was the manner they took: the humor is as annoying as it is funny most of the time, and Tommy Lee Jones is just as funny as Will Smith (that's saying something, personally) as the straight man, credit to both of them.  That said, they were a perfect for the movie, and all the supporting cast did wonderfully.\r\n\r\nVincent D'Onofrio, as \"Not Edgar\", was probably the funniest character in the movie to me, and I don't think he was supposed to be.\r\n\r\nThe \"haze the rookie by leaving out vital information\" bit is cliche and worn out, but that's have the jokes here.  I definitely like the movie, and I love what it could have been.", "Another favorite movie of mine. Aliens disguised as humans. Mmmmm sounds like real life. This movie is hilarious. I got one question, you ever flashy thing me? Lol!", "I saw this again recently - commemorating 25 years since it's original release, and to this day I still remember the image of the little aliens with the duty-free trolley of cigarettes trying to flee Earth after we are threatened with destruction by the \"Arquillian\" empire with powerful weapons - who want their \"galaxy\" back. It falls to \"K\" (Tommy Lee Jones) and his streetwise, rookie colleague \"J\" (Will Smith) to identify then try to track down this article - and the evil beast that killed their Emperor who was carrying it - before the Imperium takes it's, literally, Earth-shattering action. There is a great dynamic between the two stars, plenty of humour to compliment the fun special effects and as we discover, loads of characters amongst the alien creatures who have been inhabiting this planet since God was a boy. The ending goes on bit, but it has stood the test of time well, and is still easily the best of this franchise.", "\"Men in Black\" taps into my lifelong fascination with aliens. This sci-fi comedy is a delightful journey with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, offering a perfect mix of humor and action. It's a childhood favorite that keeps the charm alive with its stellar blend of comedy and extraterrestrial intrigue. It may showcase some dated CGI and prosthetics by today's standards, they remain acceptable, adding a nostalgic charm to the film without detracting from its overall enjoyment. The practical effects still hold up surprisingly well, adding to the movie's unique appeal. By today's standards, it is very rewatchable with a rating of 8/10."], ["I would readily admit this is one of my favourite science fiction films from the 90's. It's intelligent, well-acted and directed, and the special effects it has HELPS the story rather than IMPEDES it. Though she hasn't done much lately, either in the director's chair or acting, Jodie Foster is one of my favourite contemporary American actresses, and it's intriguing how her great talent's been utilized of late (ie., 'Elysium', and I'm still very mad at Spike Lee for having Christopher Plummer call her a 'cunt' in 'Inside Man').\r\n\r\nPersonally, I must admit that I myself have worried what other worlds' inhabitants would think of our civilization from the messages it might get from Earth. Though I thankfully haven't lost any sleep over it (I have 'Thumper' in the apartment above me to thank for that), as Led Zeppelin would say in the classic 'Stairway to Heaven', '...and it makes me wonder'.\r\n\r\nAs what happens in most of these movies, it's rather anticlimactic once the different cultures meet. I'll say to my dying day that the most difficult thing to do in cinema is end a film. Here (unlike perfect sci-fi masterpieces, like '2001: A Space odyssey' or the more recent 'Children of Men') the decent but otherwise unspectacular ending makes me avoid a perfect rating here. But it's awfully close, worth both owning and rewatching, and provides fairly early evidence (which would come to bold fruition in 'Killer Joe') that Matthew McConaughey could actually act. It's also a tossup between this, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and 'Back to the Future' for my favourite Zemeckis moment.", "Random viewing but decided to finally watch after its been in my to-do bin for a while now. It didn't strike an emotional cord that I thought it would but Jodie Foster was quite good as were a respectable supporting cast. Never quite bought into the relationship between Foster and McConaughey though in fairness, probably due to the lack of screen time together (felt like maybe 15 minutes in a 2.5 hour movie). Some of the effects were alright for its time including integrating Clinton footage with the cast and the sci-fi specific visuals were alright. In the end, never was bored and found it to be entertaining. **4.0/5**", "Early on in Contact a character is introduced who goes by the name \u201cKent Clark,\u201d and for the remainder of the film I simply could not get over the fact that no one ever even mentions that he is named after Bizarro\u2019s alter ego.\r\n\r\nMy theory is that this is a figurative wink to the audience, letting us know beforehand what we otherwise discover at long last: that the events that are about to unfold are nothing but an elaborate prank on the audience and, possibly, the cast.\r\n\r\nThis movie exists in a limbo somewhere in between Close Encounters of the Third Kind\u2019s unabashed childlike wonder and Ad Astra\u2019s adult \u2018we\u2019re alone in the Universe\u2019 pragmatism \u2013 which is a polite way of saying that Contact is neither fish nor fowl; the moral of the story, in a nutshell, is that there might be intelligent extraterrestrial life, but then again, there might not be.\r\n\r\nNow, there is nothing inherently wrong with some ambiguity, but let\u2019s consider this: untold amounts of money, physical resources and manpower are spent in the movie (but not by the movie, which prefers to cut corners and follow the unconvincing route of CGI \u2013 technology which, by the way, has not aged well nor improved a lot ever since), while we spent two and half hours of our precious time, and it\u2019s all only to learn that, maybe, aliens don\u2019t exist except in overly complicated hoaxes and the minds of impressionable people. That\u2019s a lot of work to do as well as a long way to go to arrive at a conclusion that for many, myself included, is of the foregone variety.\r\n\r\nAnd even if the extraterrestrials in the film were real, they\u2019d still be rather disappointing \u2013 though I shouldn\u2019t speak in plural, since we only see one in the form of Dr. Ellie Arroway\u2019s (Jodie Foster) long deceased father. The good news is that Ellie\u2019s dad is played by David Morse, and you could certainly do a lot worse than that (and that goes for the rest of the ensemble cast); the bad news is that Ellie\u2019s close encounter takes places on a beach that is supposedly meant to mimic a drawing she made when she was nine years old.\r\n\r\nThis is bad because the drawing, which looks like an actual preteen might have drawn it, is a veritable Monet compared with the computer-generated beach where Ellie has a very anticlimactic meeting with the alien, who tells her nothing she, or for that matter we, didn\u2019t already know or believe \u2013 which in turn doesn\u2019t mean that the place itself has to be equally underwhelming; why not a real beach? Or, perhaps even better, a set made to resemble a real beach? This would doubtless speak to either Ellie\u2019s imagination or the aliens\u2019 handicraft much more than what we end up getting.", "**A film that gets more right than it gets wrong, in a friendly tribute to Carl Sagan.**\r\n\r\nThe theme of extraterrestrial life will always be a big deal for cinema, and is one of the most solid subjects within sci-fi. On the one hand, it has already given us a series of gems, but it also occasionally gives us films so bad that they are not worth the price of the plastic DVD. This film, for me, stays on positive ground: it gives us a solid story, intelligent enough to be believable, but it completely loses its way when it tries to introduce some action and shake things up a bit.\r\n\r\nOne of the most positive aspects of this film is the credible and understandable way in which it talks about complex scientific subjects and concepts. There are high doses of science and if we take into account that Carl Sagan was one of the consultants who worked here (he died in the middle of filming and the film is dedicated to his memory), we can easily understand why it seems so solid. This is what happens when you listen to competent people, who know and who truly study.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film is reasonably within the standards of a sci-fi film from the late 90s with an already generous budget. However, despite some innovations such as the green screen and CGI effects, which were beginning to be implemented in the industry, not everything is really effective. Despite some high quality effects, the cinematography doesn't keep up, being excessively bland and uninteresting. I liked the focus on radio telescopes (we are more used to seeing optical telescopes, but listening to space is equally important) and it is incredible to see Arecibo again, one of the most cinematic and which very recently ceased to exist (which I greatly regret, by the way).\r\n\r\nJodie Foster is a highly competent actress who deserves to be congratulated for all her effort. She is charismatic and strong enough to guarantee the leading role and the quality of her work only decreases towards the end, when she had to interact with the green screen, something that was not usual for actors at this time. We can still see the quite satisfactory work of actors such as John Hurt, David Morse, Tom Skerritt or James Woods. None of them have material capable of giving them substantial time or impact, but they all did the most they could with what they were given. Despite the relevance given, probably justified by the wage received, it was sad to see Matthew McConaughey in such a dull work, devoid of any substantial value. It seems that he was just making his money and wasn't interested in the project.\r\n\r\nThe script has clearly positive points and others that, honestly, should have been eliminated. On the one hand, the scientific discussion and the theme of sending data through signals that can be captured by sound is highly relevant and looks good. I also liked seeing the difficulties that the main character experiences in obtaining financial and practical support for her research and overcoming the prejudices and lack of interest of her patrons. This is a picture of how much scientific research is currently going. From a certain point onwards, the film seeks to involve the Government and NASA, and things move towards a kind of bloated and histrionic action that is at odds with what had been done before. That was a mistake, but director Robert Zemeckis doesn't seem to learn from his mistakes, since it's not the first time it's happened in his films. Another error was the religious debate over alien life. This film did not call for this, the topic is left and should have been cut outright."], ["_**Brendan Fraser as a goofy Tarzan-like ape-man along with sweetie Leslie Mann**_\r\n\r\nAn expedition to the heart of the Dark Continent discovers a white man (Brendan Fraser) raised by apes.

It helps that Fraser is both likable and amusing in the eponymous role (I should add that he really inspires guys to improve their fitness).

On its maiden voyage, however, it vanished. Seven years later, it has returned, orbiting Neptune, and a rescue crew is sent out to investigate, along with the scientist responsible for the ship\u2019s creation. The rescue crew of the Lewis and Clark are a group of no-nonsense blue-collar workers, led by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), with Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) along for his expertise. When they arrive at the Event Horizon, they find the crew long dead. \u201cThis ship is a tomb,\u201d judges Captain Miller at one point. The rescue team begins to realize that the ship passed through a black hole created by the gravity drive, but didn\u2019t return alone. The ship with a long-dead crew shows life signs. The rescue team begins to have terrifying visions. The gravity drive begins to spin of its own accord...\r\n\r\nSomething is loose on the ship, and the rescue team has to not only unravel out what happened to the original crew, but also protect themselves from the horrors that returned with the ship. It\u2019s a simple but sturdy setup, standard B-movie stuff. What elevates Event Horizon is its first-class production design and solid atmosphere. Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, Alien vs. Predator) is not a name one would generally associate with good film product these days, but here he managed (in spite of himself, one may think given the rest of his output) to present a film steeped in suspense, with strong performances, gorgeous set pieces, and palpable horror.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s be honest: there\u2019s nothing new here. The strength of this film lies in how it fits together the pieces it stole from other films. This is very much (and very completely) The Shining by way of Alien, even to the point of lifting the character archetypes directly from Ridley Scott\u2019s 1979 masterpiece. The Event Horizon is the Overlook Hotel, teeming with supernatural power and malice. The film delves into gore in its last third, but it\u2019s not quite proficient enough to have it enhance the scares (which were doing just fine before the blood started flowing so freely). However, the film is even structured like Alien and The Shining, all slow burn and building dread until things begin to go to hell (literally, perhaps). The cast have stock characters but they bring them to life admirably, particularly Neill and Fishburne; among the secondary characters, Kathleen Quinlan, Jack Noseworthy, and Sean Pertwee are particularly memorable. The script by Philip Eisner is derivative but effective, and Anderson was clearly at the peak of his directorial prowess here. Don't misunderstand me to say that the film's lifts from other works make it bad; it's certainly not. Originality is overrated as an attribute, and fairly value-neutral even on the best of days. I'd much rather have a tale well-told than one that does weird things simply for the sake of doing weird things (French sci-fi/fantasy directors, I'm looking at you. Yes, you, Jeunet), though the greatest films find a way to combine both sturdy storytelling and originality in the medium. In total, Event Horizon is a very effective sci-fi horror film, breaking no new ground but doing what it does very well. A minor classic of the sci-fi horror genre.", "You know nothing. Hell is only a word. The reality is much, much worse. \r\n\r\nEvent Horizon is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and written by Philip Eisner.

It's derivative within the genre but it does the genre staples with no little amount of quality. The tone is set from the opening credits being accompanied by a ferociously foreboding musical score, and from there the pic delivers a \"who is going to get killed and in what order\" process - and why? Just what is the mystery at the core of it all?.\r\n\r\nA great cast has been assembled, which lifts it above its \"B\" movie roots, so with some thoughtful ideas within the narrative, it's easy to buy into the characterisations. Naturally the blood will flow, devilishly so, but the makers here put a different slant on the sci-fi/horror assailant thread. Of course it gets a bit by the numbers come the final quarter, arguably a bit hokey in fact, but it's very effective and perfect for a lights off viewing experience.\r\n\r\nSmart production design helps keeps up the chilly feel to proceedings, whilst the bleak tonal flows that director Anderson goes for really draws the engaged observer in.

A saboteur is no doubt lurking nearby.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in America, e.g. Port Valdez, Alaska (opening sequence); Lake James, North Carolina (closing scene); the state of Washington (Port Angeles & Keyport); naval bases in Los Angeles and Connecticut; USS Blueback; San Diego; as well as Liverpool, England (standing-in for Moscow).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "When British intelligence sends some photographs to CIA analyst \"Jack Ryan\" (Alec Baldwin) he immediately races to his boss (James Earl Jones) with what seems like a fantastic tale about a submarine that uses a hydro-dynamic drive. That renders it almost silent to traditional sonar and therefore a threat to NATO. Next thing we know, the Soviet's have mobilised their Atlantic fleet and it occurs to \"Ryan\" that they could have a defection on their hands. He now has to convince his sceptical superiors that this isn't just a wild goose chase, and that \"Ramius\" (Sean Connery) has a plan to bring his state of the art warship to the USA. Meantime, onboard the \"Red October\" we discover a complex plan that will test the mettle of the crew - officers and men alike, as they ostensibly conduct routine sea trials and missile drills - but with an ulterior motive that the audience knows all about, but the crew - well they're very much in the dark as the peril grows. This is a solidly entertaining story of political intrigue and deception and the claustrophobic settings of the submarines work well to give both Connery (who makes no attempt at all to disguise his thick Scots accent) and the much better than usual Baldwin room to manoeuvre. The supporting cast isn't the best - Scott Glenn, Sam Neill and Courtney B. Vance could have been cheerfully fired from a torpedo tubes early on, but they feature only sparingly as the adventure builds to an excitingly paced denouement. Could it really have happened?"], ["***\u201cBy this Axe I Rule!\u201d***\r\n\r\nAn Atlantean barbarian (Kevin Sorbo) takes the throne of Valusia when he defeats King Borna (Sven-Ole Thorsen) and so General Taligaro (Thomas Ian Griffith) & assorted \u201cnoble-blooded\u201d men conspire to overthrow Kull by resurrecting the wicked Acheron sorceress Akivasha (Tia Carrere). Karina Lombard plays Kull\u2019s love interest, Zareta, while Litefoot is on hand as the priest Ascalante.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1997, thirteen years after the last Conan movie, \u201cKull the Conqueror\u201d was intended to be the third Conan film, but Schwarzenegger declined so they morphed it into a Kull movie. For those not in the know, Kull was author Robert E. Howard\u2019s other barbarian hero, who wasn\u2019t as popular as Conan. Kull, incidentally, existed thousands of years before Conan\u2019s Hyborian Age. The switch didn\u2019t really matter because the script was loosely based on Howard\u2019s Conan story \"The Phoenix on the Sword,\" which was a rewrite of the Kull yarn \u201cBy this Axe I Rule.\u201d\r\n\r\nSorbo was in his prime here and definitely looks like Kull from the comics, except he has his characteristic geniality whereas Kull was more grim and brooding in Howard\u2019s tales. Nevertheless, Sorbo is well cast and one of the film\u2019s highlights.\r\n\r\nThe score by Joel Goldsmith is quite good, except for a couple of semi-cheesy metal riffs, like the eye-rolling riff near the beginning and another one much later during the fight at the ice cave, which isn\u2019t as bad. At least half of the score lacks any metal guitar whatsoever and most of the pieces that do include it are very good; there\u2019s just a couple of dubious riffs, which turned me off the first time I watched the movie. These wannabe metal rhythms were rather lame in 1997, let alone today.\r\n\r\nAnother flaw is that the opening of the movie is weak with Kull\u2019s dealings with the Dragon Legion and his fiery sword fight with Taligaro. If you\u2019re patient, however, the story takes a compelling turn with the palace confrontation. The production is acceptable, but noticeably inferior to \u201cConan the Destroyer\u201d (1984). I\u2019d say it\u2019s on par with \u201cThe Sword and the Sorcerer\u201d (1982), but with a superior story and more interesting characters (once you get past the lousy opening). I should add that Tia looks great as a green-eyed redhead and the fiery demon F/X at the close are quite effective.\r\n\r\nIF you can handle its obvious shortcomings, \u201cKull the Conqueror\u201d is an entertaining S&S flick that should be enjoyed by fans of Conan, Sinbad and the like. If you watched it before and didn\u2019t like it, give it a second chance. I\u2019m glad I did. It\u2019s flawed, but there\u2019s too much to appreciate to give it a negative rating.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot in Slovakia (Bratislava & Cerveny Kamen) and Croatia (Kornati National Park & Murter Island).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"], [], ["Pretty dumb movie. I was expecting this moving to be funny. It wasn't. This moving is very boring. Nothing exciting or interesting about it.", "**A somewhat one-dimensional comedy that is based on uncomfortable dialogues and situations.**\r\n\r\nI didn't really know what I was going to find when I sat down to watch this film, directed and written by Kevin Smith (who also appears in the film, in a minor role, his famous \u201cSilent Bob\u201d), who we know best for his participation in the \u201cClerks\u201d movies. When I finished, I felt moderately satisfied, even though I consider the film forgettable.\r\n\r\nThe plot is based on an unlikely romance between two very different people: Holden is a comic book artist who lives and works with his best friend, Banky. Being a conservative and conventional man, he is confused when he falls in love with Alyssa, a liberal and sexually experienced woman, who says she is a lesbian, but who does not give up having sex with men when she feels like it. The romance will cause mutual discomfort and will lead Banky to try to \u201cprotect\u201d Holden from that woman, who is so different from them.\r\n\r\nCreating a romantic comedy in which a conventional and conservative man gets involved with a clearly more liberal and experienced woman is a good idea, but the film stops there and doesn't go much further than the tension created around it. The characters are poorly developed and are limited to \u201csymbolizing\u201d incompatible ways of experiencing sexuality. We never know more about them and their motivations or thoughts, and the film is not very effective in the way it tries to create comical situations around this. Thinking about the subject, I believe that the funniest dialogues are those of Banky, who shows from an early age that his character is spontaneous and prone to saying things that shouldn't be said.\r\n\r\nWith a poorly developed script, situations whose joke never exceeds the average and production values that also do not surprise or exceed the \u201cstandard\u201d, the strongest point of this film ends up being, in my opinion, the work of the main cast, in particular Ben Affleck, Jason Lee and Joey Lauren Adams. Affleck, especially, is superb in the way he brings his character to life. One could hardly give more strength and credibility to that character. Lee is equally good, in that he can be funny, even if he is one-dimensional. Joey Adams does a very good job, and it's strange to see how this film didn't contribute much to the growth of his career."], ["Nobody said anything to me about The Full Monty!\r\n\r\nWhen male strip show act The Chippendales come to Sheffield and the local women pay in their droves to see the show, Gaz and the rest of his unemployed pals pick up on an idea to make some cash. They will do a one off show where they themselves will strip on the stage, with the difference being that this lot will go for the \"Full Monty\" - totally naked dancing!\r\n\r\nThe Full Monty is a very winning comedy, it's preposterous in premise of course, but in amongst the frivolity and outright daftness, lies a very clever and functional tale of personal relationships. In spite of what some American reviewers have said over the years, the picture is awash with very funny gags, it's just perhaps that the untrained none British eye isn't seeing the jokes? For instance, during the famous dole queue dancing sequence, have a look at the guy standing behind Tom Wilkinson, who after witnessing Wilkinson do his Fred Astaire act, merely puffs out his cheeks and carries on waiting his turn! It's little touches like that that say so much about the divide between British and American comedy.\r\n\r\nAs I alluded to earlier, The Full Monty isn't just a comedy about unsightly men doing a strip tease. We have a group of men who each strive for something in their lives, be it the strain of home life or sexual identity, these guys are given sensitive emotional themes from which to regain some dignity. If there is a criticism here, then it would have been nice to give the female characters a bit more flesh on their bones, but ultimately this really is about the boys after all. Backed up by a foot tapping soundtrack and boasting excellent performances from the cast, The Full Monty is a hugely enjoyable picture that rewards on repeat viewings. So just keep your eyes peeled for sight gags you just may have missed the last time you viewed it. 8/10", "Robert Carlyle (\"Gaz\") and Mark Addy (\"Dave\") are great in this role reversal comedy set amidst Margaret Thatcher's \"recalibration\" of Britain's manufacturing industries and communities. Sheffield is bearing the brunt of these changes, and unemployment is rife - with little hope of any of the former steel workers escaping their new found poverty. Even the foreman \"Gerald\" (Tom Wilkinson) is struggling to feed his voracious population of gnomes (and his extravagant wife). Walking past their local working men's club one day, they notice that a famous troupe of male strippers are selling it out, and so they decide that there's no reason why they can't do it too! Helped by his rather sceptical young son \"Nathan\" (Wim Snape) the dancer recruitment process amusingly starts the ball rolling in this darkly humorous story of aspiration and sheer bloody-mindedness that takes quite a fun swipe at gender roles and stereotypes. Trying to keep their plans under wraps, they clandestinely develop and rehearse their routine with plenty of Hot Chocolate and Donna Summer to get the hips swaying and the toes tapping. It's well paced and pithily written - even if some of the language wouldn't pass any political correctness tests twenty-five years later. The characterisations are largely left to develop the story without too much familial clutter and the diverse nature of the characters offers us an enjoyable and optimistic look at what the human spirit can do when it's challenged. It packs loads into ninety minutes and it's nice to see a British film that doesn't rely on national treasures or stately homes.", "**An excellent comedy, with intelligent and creative humor.**\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting comedy that shows that British cinema sometimes surprises with small gems of quality. I don't know exactly how the film was received in its country of origin (it was a time when the British were in shock due to the death of Diana Spencer, ex-wife of the current King Charles III), but, in my country, the film received little attention due to the film \u201cTitanic\u201d, a box office phenomenon. Still, as far as I know, the film was profitable overall, and was well reviewed by critics. At the 1998 Oscars, it was nominated for four awards, but only won Best Soundtrack for a Comedy or Musical, a category that only existed for a few years.\r\n\r\nThe story takes place in Sheffield, a British city famous for its steel industry, but which was greatly affected by the economic recession and the closure of many factories, similar to what happened in Detroit with the automobile industry and in Matosinhos, in my country, with canning factories. To try to earn money, six men join forces to become a group of male strippers. They have to overcome their own prejudices and then public ridicule, when everything becomes known. The film has lots of moments of intelligent, well-constructed humor, and the dialogue is quality. Contrary to what some professional critics said at the time, I thought the use of slang and specifically British words was good, as it added authenticity to the dialogue. There are also some touching moments of understanding and mutual help.\r\n\r\nThe film was very well directed by Peter Cattaneo, and was edited effectively, with a sense of rhythm that allows the film to be engaging and entertaining without wasting time or dispersing into subplots that would lead to nothing. On a technical level, the film has a good set of sets and the filming locations were very well selected, but what deserves the most attention, in my opinion, is the soundtrack, which is virtually a beautiful collection of memorable hits from the 70s. and 80s, including \u201cYou Sexy Thing\u201d, \u201cYou Can Leave Your Hat On\u201d and other well-known songs. This luxurious soundtrack was one of the aspects that I most enjoyed about the film.\r\n\r\nAnother strong point of the film is the general performance of the cast led by Robert Carlyle, a creative protagonist who gives us an inspired and spirited performance. Alongside him, we also have some great British actors such as Tom Wilkinson (in one of the best comic efforts of his career), Hugo Speer and Mark Addy. Each of them is truly good at what they do and have been given very competent material to work with."], ["***The eugenics-obsessed future in 40s/50s noir***\r\n\r\nSeveral decades in the future liberal eugenics is normal and discrimination is practiced to distinguish \"valids\" from \"in-valids,\" the latter conceived by natural means and therefore more susceptible to genetic defects. Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is an in-valid who assumes the identity of a disabled valid (Jude Law) in order to fulfill his dream of space travel. Uma Thurman and Gore Vidal are also on hand.\r\n\r\n\"Gattaca\" (1997) is a sci-fi drama \u201ctech noir,\u201d which combines futuristic science-fiction with 40s/50s noir. \r\nIt\u2019s not just the suits & hats, the cars look like 50s/60s coupes, but whine because they\u2019re electric. It\u2019s similar in this respect to \u201cDark City\u201d (1998), but more dramatic. Imagine if \u201cDick Tracy\u201d (1990) was a somber space-age sci-fi and you\u2019d have a pretty good idea. \r\n\r\nThe film flopped at the box office while critics generally praised it. It plays better if you have an interest in eugenics and the philosophies thereof. For me, it\u2019s decent, but too low-key. I prefer \u201cDark City\u201d if I\u2019m going to watch a film of this sort.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in Southern Cal: Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael; Otis College of Art and Design; CLA Building on the campus of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona; the spillway of the Sepulveda Dam; outside The Forum in Inglewood; and Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-", "Simply put, Gattaca is one of the greatest movies ever made. Some might think that's going too far but it truly is a masterpiece. Everything from the casting, set design, cinematography, writing and the Universe in which the story takes place. It is not only a great source of entertainment but an inspiring work of art. \r\n\r\nBy far the most poetic movie I have had the pleasure of watching. Every line is elegiac and truly beautiful. It's the type of movie that keeps you thinking days after the credits have rolled. Not because it is fast-paced, intense or has a crazy twist ending but for its tranquil philosophical ideas. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a jaw-dropping movie night. It should be on every cinephile's list of must-watch.", ".", "\"Vincent\" (Ethan Hawke) is determined that he wants to travel into space, but is deemed unsuitable by the genetically motivated authorities who decide these things. Luckily for him, he knows \"Jerome\" (Jude Law). He was in a nasty car accident that has left his paraplegic - but nonetheless, his genetics do qualify for the upper echelons of society necessary to go up in a rocket. The pair quickly establish a partnership by which the latter man develops some techniques to fool the detection devices and facilitate \"Vincent\" living out his dream. Just as that is set to come true, his boss is found dead in mysterious circumstances and the ensuing investigation could compromise the web of lies and identity fraud that 'Vincent\" has carefully established over the years... I honestly can't say I rated the acting here as great by anyone, including Uma Thurman who comes into things later on in the day as a bit of love interest, but the pacing of this story and the underlying premiss of genetic gradation and selection is potently presented here by auteur Andrew Niccol. We are now living in a sterile society where people's merits are all based on their past rather than their potential. Assumptions are made based on whether you eat well, drink, smoke, have sex - almost as if you are accruing (or not) life points, not just for you but for future generations too! The production looks great in it's modern simplicity - even if there is what looked like an old Rover car used to ferry the investigator \"Lamar\" (Xander Berkeley) and a man who introduces another twist as we near the denouement.

A personal favourite._", "##No time for regrets in the fury of battle\r\nAgain and again there are undertones in this movie that show us that the situation is not as simple as the leaders of the world portrayed in the film might want their underlings to believe. A reporter asks the question whether the humans were the ones who started the war and whether the Arachnids are simply acting in self-defense. A talk show guest finds the idea that there could be intelligent Arachnids preposterous, showing how much the propaganda has done to degrade the enemy. In a great scene we see the eye of one of the arachnids for the first time and for a second I was wondering what was going on inside the creature. Of course, this brief moment of reflection is quickly erased by a gun shot and the continuation of the fury of war.\r\n\r\nBut this, to me, seems to add to the overall anti-war message: The soldiers can only stay obedient servants if they are not given moments to reflect and question the system. And so when the viewer see the propaganda clip at the very end of the movie proclaiming triumphantly and bombastically \"They'll fight and they'll win\", they might have already forgotten that just a moment ago they saw a sentient being being tortured in the name of this promised glorious victory.", "Good watch, will watch again, and can recommend, possible for a Bad Movie Night.\r\n\r\nI'll start by saying the movie definitely isn't good, it's infamous for being a bad movie that people still love.  Granted it was 1997, but the cg effects were horrendous.  The practicals actually weren't so bad, but there are very few shots to actually appreciate them.  Again, 1997, this movie is weirdly dated with its perception of what the future would have been.\r\n\r\nFor those that weren't familiar, this is most decidedly spurred by the popularity of Starcraft in the late 1990's, and that there weren't too many horde movies out there, at least not ones that weren't zombies.  Clearly inspired by Starcraft's Zerg and Warhammer 40K's Tyranids, a bug by any other name.\r\n\r\nThe world is amazingly crafted, and we only see the tip of the iceberg.  There could have been an entire \"Star Trek\" style series set in that universe.  For the parts written all the acting is sufficient, the cannon fodder acts at the level of characters that would be thrown away, the stars are clearly the stars, and there is some hierarchy in between.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't know how much better they could have casted this, but I imagine if the character work in the script had been better, then maybe they could have drawn a couple of names.  There is a young Neil Patrick Harris, and Amy Smart, and Dina Myers was golden, but the other characters weren't exactly likable, and I can't figure out if it was the character writing or I just didn't like their faces.  I get Denise Richards was a big deal, but her nose makes me remember the Grinch blooper where Carey bites off the mayor's nose, and even in \"Wild Things\" I thought Neve Campbell could do better.\r\n\r\nThe large picture stuff is a good enough, and it's filled with enough action and well placed comedy that it'll get you through the movie.\r\n\r\nIt's fun, please don't take it seriously.

The story marries loads of typical gung-ho boot camp scenarios with some well photographed action scenes as our hero and his team of kick-ass buddies take on the gazillions of bugs intent on sucking out brains, tearing folks limb from limb and, generally, being a bit nasty! The dialogue is terrible, but that doesn't matter - this is a shameless piece of entertainment aimed squarely at folks who want to switch off their brain and watch a shoot-em up with loads of pyrotechnics, special effects and a bit of harmless eye candy. There are a couple of cameos from \"Doogie Howser\" himself (Neil Patrick Harris) - as a mind reading fellow clad in a rather SS-style uniform; Clancy Brown and Michael Ironside provide the physical (if not exactly cerebral) muscle and eagle eyed folks might even spot \"Blanche\" from the \"Golden Girls\" (Rue McClanahan) early on too. Never going to win any prizes for the script or the acting, but the effects were Oscar nominated and the action - after a rather slow start - proves to be pretty end-to-end, and enjoyable.

He is happy with his lot, shuns commitment and his best form of defence is attack both physically and verbally against those who want to impose their will on him for better or worse.\r\n\r\nAt the same university a professor of mathematics throws out a complex mathematical challenge to his students, asking them to complete the formula on a blackboard in the hall outside of his classroom. Will is cleaning floors one morning, comes across the blackboard and within seconds he has completed the formula before carrying on his duties while the professor wonders who it was!\r\n\r\nIt turns out Will was abused in his youth, and has moved on from one foster family to the next, but none of them were seemingly any better, and never reached out to his needs leaving him feeling bitter and angry.\r\n\r\nA psychology professor (Robin Williams), spends various sessions with Will, and slowly, ever so slowly, Will begins to open up his darker side until both Will and the professor find a bond.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake the premise is original but predictable.

She soon fell in love with him, only to find that he never reciprocated and pushed her away just as had done to other people who tried to get too close to him in the past.\r\n\r\nIt is very much a feel-good film with a nice satisfying ending.

The poster makes it look like a film of that sort, in my defence.\r\n\r\nI also didn't realise, aside from the lead two, that the cast list was so stacked until the credits came up at the start. The names didn't let me down either, as the acting is superb across the board. Matt Damon and Robin Williams are truly outstanding together, I already rate them from other productions so I'm glad I can add another cracker to their respective filmographies.\r\n\r\nEven away from Messrs Damon and Williams, you've got very good displays from the likes of Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Minnie Driver (emotionally, particularly, excellent) and Ben Affleck. Pretty impressive that it was written by both Affleck and Damon too!\r\n\r\nThe plot is great, the way the friendship builds between Will (Damon) and Sean (Williams) is so beautifully done. Both characters are very interesting, even if I didn't buy the genius of Will at all at first but I quickly let that go as the film does such a grand job at crafting everything together around it.\r\n\r\nIn short, it's ace! Glad I finally checked it out.", "\"Will\" (Matt Damon) is a rudderless character who works as a caretaker. He's an attitudinal pain in the neck whom, aside from his best friend \"Chuckie\" (Ben Affleck), is pretty much shunned by everyone. \"Professor Lambeau\" (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) spots some potential in this wayward lad, especially when he realises that he has an amazing ability to solve mathematical problems. To that end he sends him to see the eccentric psychologist \"Sean\" (Robin Williams) who proves remarkably adept at cutting down the young man's defences and at beginning to rebuild the character of the man in a more positive and life-affirming fashion. The film combines some excellent performances from all four men, but especially a bang on-form Williams as the penetrative, but flawed, route to salvation for an equally flawed and angry almost younger version of himself in the genius \"Will\". Damon is entirely convincing as his temper and his prodigious nature are juggled adeptly and aided by a powerful script that allows the actors to take and keep centre stage as the potency of the plot becomes more and more focussed, we are presented here with a ground-breaking and thought-provoking look at what makes a great teacher as well as what makes a human being tick, what makes one happy and fulfilled - and what makes one the opposite! For my money, Gus Van Sant's finest interpretative work and well worth watching a few times, for more detail emerges to appreciate each time you see it.", "**A very good film, but with some flaws and problems that deserve attention.**\r\n\r\nThis film is about a boy from Boston, who comes from very poor backgrounds, but who has a gift for mathematics, easily solving theorems and advanced problems that leave Harvard professors unanswered. He is discovered after solving one, at night and without telling anyone, and one of the professors at the university decides to help him be someone and make use of his gift. The problem is that he doesn't want to, he's not able to trust anyone, and he's seriously stuck with justice. Therefore, he will recruit an irreverent psychiatrist to try to help the boy.\r\n\r\nThe film's premise is very good, and the story has merits that we cannot ignore or minimize. It's one of those delicious movies to watch, that leaves us without feeling the time that passes. We really know that guy is not a bad person, but it's not easy to like the character due to his options and his bad social attitude. However, what bothered me the most was the construction of Robin Williams' character and his whole way of acting and accompanying that patient. I think anyone who has ever had the need to see a psychiatrist knows that they have strict rules about what they can and cannot do, and Williams' character breaks a good number of them.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads us to talk about actors. I really enjoyed Williams' work, but he is a long way from the best that the actor has given us. Matt Damon also did a good job, perhaps one of the best of his career, and one that opened more doors for him in his professional life. Stellan Skarsgard also intelligently took advantage of the opportunity to impose himself on the American cinematic scene, with a job well done and of great merit. Minnie Driver also did an interesting job, perhaps even more so than Ben Affleck, whose character doesn't have as much visibility or relevance.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has many merits, starting with the excellent cinematography, a good set of sets and interesting costumes. The effects are understated, but they work quite well, and the soundtrack also does a pretty good job. It is not, however, a film that stands out for its technical aspects, nor could it be. The important thing in this film is the story it brings us and the work of the cast.", "Psychological drama well in the beginning of Ben Aflleck and Matt Damon in their careers - they star (with Matt in the role of the protagonist) and wrote the script together.

Catching up with Matt Damon character Will he can be out of parole if he gets a job and consult with a psychiatrist what shows to be a tid bit tough thing. \r\n\r\nThe film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run against a $10 million budget, and received nominations in nine categories, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won in two: Best Supporting Actor for Williams and Best Original Screenplay for Affleck and Damon. Nothing bad, at all for someone being just out of Harvard University. Anther curiosity: character Skylar in the movie have the same name and background of Matt Damon's girlfriend back then.\r\n\r\nRobin Williams acts as the psychiatrist that could connect with this troubled boy, in a solid role - speaking of solid role it was nice to see Matt Damon out of some action movie in really nice drama scenes. Another actor that shows up is Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, yes the father of the four sons the most known being Bill (of \"It\"). \r\n\r\nNice heartwarming moving movie thought the end with a solid script. I would scorre it a 8.0 out of 10.0 / B+.

It stars Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Amy Brennerman and Danny Trejo. Music is scored by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Dante Spinoti.\r\n\r\nBig time thief Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is after one last major score before he retires, but hot on his tail is Vincent Hannah (Pacino), a cop equally and methodically as driven as he is himself.\r\n\r\nIn the build up to Heat's release, much was made of it being the first on screen pairing of DeNiro and Pacino. A mouthwatering prospect for sure, it proved to be worth the wait and unfolds as a lesson in restrained acting with two modern greats affording each other the respect that was due. What we didn't realise in the build up to the film's release, was that it would prove to be one of the greatest cops and robbers movies of all time, brought to us by an auteur director whose kink for realism and commitment to research stands him out from much of the modern directing pack.\r\n\r\nRarely does a film come together as one, where all the cogs of the engine are in tune, but Heat is one such picture. From cast performances to visual aesthetics, to screenplay and actual substance of story, Heat is as meticulous as it is thrilling. There are a myriad of characters brilliantly stitched together in one de-glamorised City of Angels, as plot develops, and each character and their crumbling relationships come under inspection, we are witnessing a coarse viewpoint of human nature, where people's lives are ended or defined by their choices. Everywhere you look, here, there are folk cracking under the strain of being exposed to high end crime, dreams, hopes and happiness are unlikely to be achieved, and this is on both sides of the law.\r\n\r\nFor Heat, Mann fuses the tonal and visual ticks of Manhunter with that of the adrenalin rushes from Last of the Mohicans, with the former gorgeously born out by Spinoti's pin sharp photography, the latter thrillingly realised by Mann's skill at action set pieces. Once again word of mouth about the key heist and shoot out in the film led to high expectation, and again there is no disappointment. L.A. becomes a battle ground, rapid gunfire punctures the air, cars swerve and crash, bodies fall, visually and aurally it drags you to the edge of your seat, an extended action sequence fit to sit with the best of them. The kicker as well is that because Mann has been so detailed in his characterisations, we care about what happens to all parties, we understand motives and means. Which in a film with such a huge support cast is quite an achievement.\r\n\r\nThere is enough in Heat to fill out a dozen other cops and robbers films, fans of neo-noir and crime films in general are spoilt supreme here. It's not rocket science really, put a group of great actors together, give them an intelligent script to work from and let them be guided by a director who will not sit still, and you get a great film. Heat, the ultimate predator and prey movie, where from beginning to end it refuses to be lazy or cop out, and energy and thought seeps from every frame. 10/10", "Partly I'm disappointed in myself for taking so long to watch _Heat_ because it's such a massive influence on one of the best movies ever (_The Dark Knight_), and one my favourite video games ever (_Payday: The Heist_).\r\n\r\nMostly though, I'm disappointed in myself for taking so long to watch _Heat_ because I've denied myself for so long the privilege of having seen such a great fucking crime movie.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - An all round good movie with a little something extra._", "**Heat earns its way onto top 25 lists for heist films and 90s action, but its faults keep it low in the rankings.**\r\n\r\nHeat gets so many things right. The stellar cast continues to surprise me with all the different names and faces I recognize when I watch it. The action is exceptional, especially considering this film is over 25 years old. The shoot-out in the middle of the movie is riveting, raw, and powerfully hard-hitting. The story made it impossible to guess exactly how it would turn out - was the cop going to get his man, or was the mastermind thief going to get away? Heat belongs on best heist and action movie lists but not nearly as high as many lists rank it. Heat carries some annoying faults. The ending of the film is abrupt and unsatisfying. The runtime is at least 45 minutes too long. The biggest frustration was Al Pacino\u2019s performance. He was so over the top that his character felt like he was in the wrong movie. Every other action delivered genuine and serious performances while Pacino was screaming about women\u2019s butts. What? Heat is a good film, but these low points keep it from being great.", "\u201cHeat\u201d directed by Michael Mann is a crime epic based on the exploits of real life criminal Neil McCauley. \u00a0Although mostly fictional, with the events and character having real life basis, Mann is able to elevate this crime drama above other films in a similar genre.\u00a0\r\n\r\nRobert De Niro plays Neil McCauley, a knowledgable experienced criminal who\u2019s skill set includes playing cat and mouse with the police. After a robbery ends in a street gunfight McCauley and his gang manage to evade the police. Lieutenant Vincent Hanna ( Al Pacino ) determined to catch the criminals, skilfully assesses the crime scene and immediately \u201c Heat\u201d begins to draw parallels between the two lead characters.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFilmed entirely on location \u201cHeat\u201d is a gripping, tension filled viewing experience that has the viewer uncertain who to route for throughout the entire proceedings.", "**A good film, with great actors at the highest level, a little different from other action films and that deserves to be revisited these days.**\r\n\r\nIf there's one thing that can be a good pastime, it's an action movie, with ingenious and fearless thieves and police willing to do anything to arrest them. That's what this movie is, basically, and although we've seen many movies with this recipe, neither does it become tiresome, nor do the movies become boring or less interesting.\r\n\r\nMichael Mann is today a director with solid action credits, thanks in part to this film, but also to \u201cThe Insider\u201d and \u201cCollateral\u201d. Before this film, he had shown extraordinary competence in directing \u201cLast of the Mohicans\u201d, a film that I consider an example for harmonizing creative freedom, absolute historical rigor and a great respect for the source material. In this film, Mann does not disappoint and once again gives us solid, consistent, committed and creative direction.\r\n\r\nFor the cast, several great actors with given evidence were called. Of course, it's not possible for everyone to have the same degree of protagonism, but I think that each one of them had the time and material necessary to do a very well done job. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro clearly stand out from the crowd. In addition to having the central characters of the plot, they are both incredibly intense, charismatic, explosive. It's worth watching this duel of the titans. Pacino is the most unlikable and difficult to like because he is constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. De Niro is kinder and more human, so it's not hard to root for him. In addition to them, we have the excellent work of Val Kilmer and Jon Voight, and a well accomplished performance of Tom Sizemore. The film also features appearances by Danny Trejo (almost playing himself) and a teenager named Natalie Portman, among many other well-known names.\r\n\r\nDespite everything, this film has little action, many will say. And really, the priority that was given here is the development of the characters and each of their stories, so that the action is more concentrated in some specific sequences like the anthological sequence of the robbery and shooting in the middle of the street. I liked that, and I liked that this movie tried to be different in a positive way. My only criticism is the slow and tiresome pace that the film assumes most of the time. With a slightly faster pace thanks to some surgical cuts, the film would become lighter.\r\n\r\nFilmed in Los Angeles, in the city itself (I can only imagine what a logistical nightmare it must have been!), the film couldn't have better sets and costumes, striving for total realism. The special effects work very well, the cinematography is wonderful, and the film is visually very elegant and mature."], ["We start with the sight of a young girl cleaning the limousine her father drives for the wealthy \"Larrabee\" family. She has a crush on the younger brother \"David\", but that is but a pipe dream as she grows up and is sent to Paris where she learns cordon bleu cooking skills. Upon her return, the now much older \"David\" (William Holden) offers her a lift and though he doesn't recognise her, it is soon clear that she has lost none of her affections for him, and he now reciprocates. This throws a spanner in the works for the older brother \"Linus\" (Humphrey Bogart) who plans a large scale merger to make his bouncy glass, and that involves his brother marrying the daughter of the partner company. \"David\" is having none of this, but after he has an untimely accident involving his backside and some broken glass, \"Linus\" concocts a plan to send \"Sabrina\" back to France. This erstwhile steely man does not, however, factor in the effect his hanging out with this vibrant and intelligent young woman is going to have on him - and pretty soon he is just as smitten as his brother! John Williams adds value as her stiff upper lipped father; \"Waltons\" fans might recognise Ellen Corby in the role of his hyper-confident secretary \"Miss McCardle\" and Billy Wilder's script is entertaining and witty. There is a great chemistry on screen between the hugely charismatic Hepburn and Bogart and we do learn how not to make a souffl\u00e9 omelette! Great fun.", "**An excellent romantic comedy and one of Billy Wilder's best works.**\r\n\r\nI saw this film yesterday and I really liked it. I have seen other films with the same actors and there is no doubt that they ooze talent, and it is always a safe bet to see the films they made. This romantic comedy, unlike many of those currently produced, does not seem bland or excessively sugary: the romance and comedy intertwine in the ideal measure to make us laugh and enjoy the characters and the story.\r\n\r\nDirected and intelligently written by Billy Wilder, who gives us one of the best films of his career, it brings us the classic story of the employee's daughter who falls in love with the boss's son. I've seen this in films, in plays, in soap operas in almost every country... it's one of the oldest ideas for a romantic film. What really gives the film strength is the way the director conceives everything and leaves his vision imprinted in every detail. This vision of him includes a very intelligent comedy and a cast full of talents, led by the magnificent Audrey Hepburn, experiencing one of the most interesting moments of his career. She couldn't look more elegant, and it was interesting to see how the actress, so associated with noble or refined characters, embodied one who comes from such modest origins! I also really liked William Holden, who does a very committed and intelligent job. As for Humphrey Bogart... he is always a safe bet, an actor who commits himself to his work and guarantees results, but if even he was aware that he was too old for the role, what can I say? He was absolutely right...\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, there isn't much to say: the film doesn't invest much in great effects and complicated cinematographic resources. In fact, all things considered, it seems like the kind of film where most of the budget was spent on ensuring the presence of a hand-picked cast. The cinematography is quite regular, functional and practical, the soundtrack does not bring great quality notes and goes unnoticed, the sets and costumes fulfill their role wonderfully, but are within what we expected to see. Of course, the costumes are an interesting aspect of the film, with a valuable contribution from Hubert de Givenchy (unfairly uncredited) quite evident behind the production efforts."], [], ["_**Cage terminally drunk in Las Vegas with Elisabeth Shue and lots of jazz/blues**_\r\n\r\nAn alcoholic in Los Angeles (Nicolas Cage) cashes out of the film industry and moves to Las Vegas to apparently drink himself to death. He meets a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue) with whom he has a welcome affinity and they develop a relationship of radical acceptance.\r\n\r\n\"Leaving Las Vegas\" (1995) is one of those downbeat realistic dramas about lost souls in hopeless dissolution. It\u2019s well-done for what it is and Shue\u2019s beauty is effectively showcased despite the unappealing nature of her profession. And I understand the message of \u201cloving\u201d acceptance with no questions. Although it could be argued that true love refuses to enable people to destroy themselves and holds them accountable to some reasonable degree.  \r\n\r\nA guy who was my best friend 20 years ago developed an alcohol problem that became increasingly glaring. He died recently, but I didn\u2019t see him for the last four years of his life because I refused to see someone drink themselves to death.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area (Burbank & Santa Monica) and Nevada (Las Vegas, Laughlin & Paradise).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+", "**A dense film, difficult to see, but one that should be seen, especially by young people who think that getting drunk is relevant to a night of fun.**\r\n\r\nThis film is based on the true story of a man who lost his will to live after a complicated divorce and the end of his personal and professional life as he gave way to alcohol addiction. With no prospects of getting back on top, he decides to go to Las Vegas, the city of all sins in the USA, and drink everything he can until he ends his own life. In the meantime of these suicidal intentions, he meets a prostitute with whom he has a very complicated relationship because, deep down, she too walks her own path of self-destruction.\r\n\r\nThe film is excellent, but it is deeply heavy, depressing, difficult to watch. In addition to taking us to the most negative and destructive side of alcoholism, it also shows us, without fear of shocking, how it can lead to death. That is, it shows us in very hard colors that drinking is an addiction, it is a serious problem and it can kill. It makes it clear that alcohol is not something that we can or should relativize, a punctual, occasional excess on Friday night. It is not something we should tolerate in the behavior of our children or family members. I say this at a time when drinking has become all too common, especially among young people, for whom getting drunk is a \u201csine qua non\u201d condition for a night of fun. Anyone going to work the next morning can easily see young people, many of them women and looking as if they are not even 20 years old, sitting on the side of the sidewalk, next to nightclubs or bus stops, drunk or vomiting in scenes worthy of a pity that I refuse to feel because, after all, they wanted to stay that way. Many are Portuguese, but there are also many tourists who seem to come to my country because the law is more permissive than it should be. For me, who was brought up on the danger of addiction and only got seriously drunk once, it pains me to see how this youth considers excess fundamental in fun and I just hope, one day that I'm a father, I never have to go get one. child in such a state. I would be ashamed.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the movies that made Nicholas Cage's career. The actor does a remarkable job, and if we think about the turn that his life and career would later take, it's really a shame that he couldn't maintain this level. It's hard to see the way he gives his character all the elements to capture our sympathy as she slides down a path of no return. Elizabeth Shue, who gave life to the prostitute, also does a job full of merits, even if her character is much more conventional. After all, it is not the first time, nor the last, that the cinema has met a prostitute with feelings. There is a love story between the two characters, that is undeniable, but we can question to what extent it is really believable, since love is never used to redeem or grant the characters a path of salvation, a way out of the life of addiction and destruction they are in. And to some extent, even if this is rehearsed, such an option is largely rejected, especially by the character of Cage, who seems determined to die.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has several points of merit, especially with regard to cinematography and editing. The film was very well filmed, it uses light and shadow very well to thicken the whole environment of degradation in which the characters move, with the bright lights of the casinos working, almost, like the bright flame that attracts the moths to their death and perdition. It is in this environment that we see the characters live the only scenes of pleasure and relaxation, which only serve to keep pushing them to the bottom of the well. Very well edited, the film doesn't waste time with things that don't matter, it maintains a very pleasant pace and provides two hours that leave us thinking.", "Is there any profession portrayed in cinema more likely to be an obnoxious alcoholic than an Hollywood screen writer? Well that's what \"Ben\" (Nicolas Cage) is and when he gets fired after one too many absences and foul-mouthed outbursts, he takes his redundancy cheque and his BMW and heads to Vegas. He doesn't have a plan, except perhaps to drink himself into a stupor from which he won't wake up. Meantime, we've met hooker \"Sera\" (Elisabeth Shue) who has a rather brutal relationship with her flaky pimp \"Yuri\" (Julian Sands) and works the Strip looking for high rollers to seduce. They meet in a casino and quickly conclude that there might be an element of safety, certainly sanity, in numbers and are soon living together platonically. What now ensues illustrates the perils for both as they continue down paths that seem destined to lead to self-destruction. \"Sera\" exposing herself to dangers every time she goes to work whilst \"Ben\" showers with two bottles of vodka to contain his increasingly dominant shakes. The soundtrack does much to help set the mood here, as these two people gradually fall in love - but it's not a sentimental love. It comes across more as a growing inter-dependency fuelled by affection and a desire to look out for each other - however doomed to failure we might anticipate that to be. Cage is on great form here, he really does carry of the role skilfully and plausibly - but I think Shue takes more of the plaudits for me. She allows her essentially quite decent character to thrive and to grow, demonstrating quite a degree of humanity even when faced with brutality and humiliation on a fairly regular basis. She also manages to give us a sense of a woman who is trying to escape but just doesn't know how. Mike Figgis keeps the pace taut and effective and with both on solid form with an actually quite emotional story, this is well worth two hours."], [], [], [], [], [], ["**It's a good movie, but I've seen better courtroom dramas.**\r\n\r\nI saw this film not long ago and was very impressed with its quality. I didn't know, however, that it was based on a novel by John Grisham (I've never read it, and I have doubts if it was translated into Portuguese), and based very lightly on the emotional testimony of a young girl victim of rape. It should be noted, moreover, and by mere curiosity, that, in the real case behind the novel, the victim was a white girl and the man accused of having raped her was black. In summary, it's very good, but it's not a perfect film, and it pales in comparison to other much more consistent and effective courtroom dramas.\r\n\r\nJoel Schumacher is the director of this movie, and that's really surprising me because his work rarely pleases me. I was able to appreciate the qualities of \u201cNumber 23\u201d, the beauty and musicality of \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d were able to captivate me, but on the other hand, I hate the two \u201cBatman\u201d films he made, and I felt that \u201c8\u00a0mm\u201d is one of those films full of potential that ends up not living up to expectations. And then, this movie. And I'm still wondering whether I should consider the director responsible for the film's biggest weaknesses, or as a redeeming work that shows that, despite the crap, Schumacher had some talent.\r\n\r\nThe cast is strong. Despite the downward trajectory that his career has taken after his consecration, Matthew McConaughey is in good shape here and gives the public an enjoyable job. It's not the actor's best, it's nothing original, especially if we think about courtroom dramas, but it's effective and it looks credible. Samuel L. Jackson also does a good job, but the character is the most ambiguous in the film, and he can be a villain or a hero depending on our opinion (and the film makes an effort to sell him a hero). Kevin Spacey is good in a highly stereotyped character, and Donald Sutherland gives an air of his grace when the material allows. Less interesting were the appearances of Kiefer Sutherland and Sandra Bullock.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's a low-key film, without major visual strokes or effects, which is good as it gives all the necessary space to the story and the actors' performance. It does, however, have good cinematography, a clever use of filming locations and sets, and also good costumes. It's a little long for the story it brings, but that fact doesn't constitute a very serious problem here.\r\n\r\nThe story has problems that we have to consider. It begins beautifully, presenting the opening incident with shocking colors and tones. The scene where the father kills his daughter's rapists is also incredibly well done, but the rest, and especially the scenes outside the courtroom, are bland. Bullock's character is so expendable that it was preferable that it had never been added: she appears to throw some adulterous romance into the script, but that never goes beyond a succession of flirtations because the main character does not have the nerve to really cheat on his wife. For the rest, she gives him some good ideas, aiding an incompetent lawyer to do a job well done, but that would have been better if it had come from Donald Sutherland, giving him a greater utility and better material.\r\n\r\nI had serious problems with the trial of this film, starting with the judge's attempts to focus the facts on the death of the rapists. This would never be acceptable by a real court or a real defense, considering that, after the obvious failure of the transient insanity claims, the defense would have to rely on a clean criminal record, good citizenship and a truckload of extenuating circumstances in order to lighten the penalty to which that man was fatally to be condemned. And the most credible and convincing mitigating factor for a judge or jury would be, exactly, the enormous commotion that the rape would have caused, leading that father to act in a way that would have been impossible under other circumstances. And the insertion of the KKK in the film, not being a problem in itself, only serves to exaggerate a racial problem that is already there and that doesn't need to be exaggerated anymore.", "The opening scenes of this movie are the sort that stay with you for ever: the brutal assault and murder of a young girl by two rednecks in Mississippi. Before their trial, they are gunned down in the courthouse by the girl's bereft father \"Carl Lee Hailey\" (Samuel L. Jackson) and it falls to \"Brigance\" (Matthew McConaughey) to defend the man in a state riddled with institutional and communal bigotry. Kevin Spacey is effective as the DA (\"Buckley\") who assumes the all white jury will never countenance the murder of these two odious creatures by a black man, but he doesn't count on the resolution - despite threats to himself and to his family - of \"Brigance\" and of his feisty assistant \"Ellen\" (Sandra Bullock). Joel Schumacher really does capture the almost viscerally racist elements of John Grisham's book cleverly here with frequently potent, but not unnecessarily graphic, scenarios depicting just how \"justice\" was expected to flow, even though there is never any doubt about the guilt of either the initial rapists/killers or of her avenging father. McConaughey is super. Sure, he has the boy next door looks but here, also, he portrays his determined character in a convincing manner. So does Bullock - demonstrating, through one especially harrowing scene, that she has more to her than we see with her more regular smart-mouthed comical roles. As ever, Patrick McGoohan excels - this time as the aptly named judge \"Noose\" and both Donald and Kiefer Sutherland and a few short scenes from Oscar winning Brenda Fricker all serve to demonstrate that there is still some semblance of hope (and futility) against the inherently malevolent prevailing attitudes of the time. The closing speech at the end from \"Brigance\" is especially potent. SLJ was nominated for a Golden Globe, his appearances are fine but sparing, but there was a curious dearth of plaudits for McConaughey which I found astonishing - he holds the threads of this menacing, at times quite sickening drama together well till the end. Not an easy watch, but well worth it."], ["This is a fine production of the Jane Austen novel, though it is not among my top two favorite adaptations. Not for any serious problems, but rather due to minor decisions that were made in the script. I expected to see more of Emma\u2019s visit to Miss Bates, for example, after she is shamed into repenting her treatment of the silly woman. \r\n\r\nOther than that I enjoyed the movie well enough. The acting and the script were consistently good except for those moments I mentioned, and I would probably be willing to watch it again someday.", "**A futile and silly Emma to be taken seriously, but entertaining and has some good moments.**\r\n\r\nJane Austen is one of the great writers in the English language and her work has been fertile ground for adaptations and reinterpretations in theatre, television and cinema. From trash to luxury, there's no shortage of options, and each one stands out for one reason or another. This film was inspired by one of the author's novels about a charismatic and dreamy young woman who takes pleasure in gathering acquaintances and friends, and playing matchmaker. The problem is that, deep down, she herself feels lonely and doesn't really see a man capable of making her sigh, and almost all the dating arrangements she makes also end up with terrible results.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this is another one of the works where Austen criticizes the society she knows, and where people are measured by their income and land assets, leaving their character and other \u201csecondary\u201d details behind. It was an elitist society, more bourgeois than aristocratic (what defines a person's value is their income, and noble titles end up being a means of financial income and not a sign of honor and nobility), and where love, romance and the opinion of the bride and groom was not much considered when it came to arranging marriage. All this is visible here. Filmed as a romantic comedy of sorts, the big problem with this film is that it all feels a little too vain, superficial and silly to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\nGwyneth Paltrow had, in this film, one of her first roles of great notoriety, and we can say that, despite the time that has passed and the actress is still active, it is still one of the best films she has made. Paltrow knows how to be naive and well-meaning without seeming too silly for it, and she manages to deftly balance her character's attitudes in the fine interval between the gentle silliness and the excessive pampering of who she grew up with everything she wanted. Even better, Jeremy Northam does an extraordinary job and the same can be said for Toni Collete and Alan Cumming. Denys Hawthorne also does what she can, but like many of the more minor actors, she doesn't have as good material as the others.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film stands out for the quality of its cinematography, sets and costumes. The production went to great lengths to recreate the era and environments realistically, believably, and intelligently. However, it is the only thing. The dialogues could frankly be better, there are virtually no notable effects (but the ones that were used work very well) and the music and soundtrack are totally worthy of oblivion.", "Hmmm. I'm not really an huge Jane Austen fan - and \"Emma\" is one of her least engaging stories, I find. Gwyneth Paltrow takes on the mantle of the title character, a rather thoughtless young woman who spends way too much time interfering in the lives of others - and not always with the best of intentions - frequently leaving a trail of emotional mayhem in her wake. It is only Jeremy Northam (\"Mr. Knightley)\" who dares to call a spade a spade with her, and to encourage her to mend her meddling ways, and to take up the opportunity of the love that is staring her in the face - before it is too late. Paltrow is fine as the adaptation is less wordy than in the original tome: Northam has a charm and sense of fairness that endears him to the audience (though, frankly, what he sees in \"Emma\" - aside from physical beauty - is anyone's guess) and there are a couple of nice supporting efforts from Alan Cummings, Juliet Stevenson and a really rather delightful performance from the put-upon \"Mrs. Bates\" (Phyllida Law). Rachel Portman provides a melodic and gentle score to accompany this very good looking drama, but it was all just a bit too Merchant Ivory for me, without the charm or the finesse of these colourful iterations."], ["Nice sports-rom-com that works thanks to the chemistry between Costner and Russo (and generally she's great against any male lead) and there are some good sports moments, even if it is golf.

But first he has to deal with the cocky nemesis that is Johnson's star laden showy golfer.\r\n\r\nThe sports based movie is a tough nut to crack, the margins for narrative worth are thin, there's only so much one can take such a genre to. Here we have one of the staples of said genre, that of a washed up sportsman getting a second shot at glory.

It is testament to the director and writers (Shelton and John Norville) that these characters manage to rise above stereotype status, and crucially they are given sharp dialogue to spout.

Slowly, but surely, Anthony Minghella ensures that the threads start to come together - but tragedy seems to follow the Count wherever he goes, and it isn't long before we fill in the blanks that led him to his present, terminal state.

John Seale uses the light wonderfully on the Tunisian Sahara, at the eerily beautiful \"Cave of Swimmers\" and at the various Italian locations that add huge richness to this gently unfolding story. Fiennes and KST have a wonderful, understated, chemistry between them; Binoche adds real integrity and humanity to her role, and though Dafoe features quite sparingly, his crucial part in unravelling this human puzzle is played deftly.

I\u2019ll see and support any new _Scream_ film or TV series that comes along because of it. I know this new installment was successful ($88.4 million worldwide box office gross as of this writing) and some enjoyed it, but it is honestly my least favorite in the franchise.\r\n\r\nThis new film feels like it\u2019s trying too hard to be one of the original _Scream_ films when it should have just been more of its own thing. This is something the film addresses, but originality should always triumph over retreading familiar territory; especially when it seems like its kills are being plunged into the same stab wounds.\r\n\r\nFull review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Scream-2022-Review-Movies-Make-Psychos-More-Imitative", "Decent movie with a nice balance of meta / references to the original without overdoing it.", "Okay addition to the franchise has some good kills and the acting at least was serviceable and nice seeing the legacy characters again. The killer's motivations did feel a bit 5 years ago (to me, though I don't do reddit or really other social media platforms) but fine I guess and similar to the social commentary from Scream 4. I'd rank this third in the franchise I suppose, behind the original and Scream 2 (for all that movie's flaws, it has a soft spot for me). Not great but worth watching once. **3.25/5**", "Scream is a self-aware thriller that doesn't try to be more than it is. The kills are great, the violence is there, and the comedy is good enough that is doesn't take away from the movie.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Good_", "I've watched every scream since scream was invented. I like the first two okay but after that the kind of got a little iffy. This one really goes back to what screen was intended to be by Wes Craven. I really like the flow of this movie and how they put the twist on Samantha's character. It starts like the first scream and it ends like the first scream. I'll have to say out of all the scream movies this was one of the most decent and hardest to figure out.", "**One of the best slasher flicks since 1996!**\r\n\r\nI loved the first Scream - the surprise, the shock, the self-awareness, the humor. It reinvented horror and launched a franchise of sequels of varying quality. And this newest one is the best since the first! It captured all the fun of the first. It kept the stakes high by bringing back the original cast and proving that no one is truly safe. The directors had fun baiting the audience with every slasher trope they could. Tense music would rise every time a character walked past a dark doorway or opened a cabinet to hide the view from the hall - naturally, that is when the killer is standing on the other side but not in Scream! Playing with the tropes in a fun, self-aware way is what Scream is all about, and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett nailed it.", "Some things never change. This can be good and also bad. Bad like Audibly Sharp knives (i.e., blades that make a sharpening noise when being whisked through thin air), or like when former deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette) says \u201cYou have to shoot 'em in the head, or they always come back.\u201d Of course, the very existence of the new Scream is irrefutable proof that they will come back regardless. This movie is slasher history repeating itself in more ways than one; in addition to revisiting this particular franchise, it borrows a key plot point from Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare \u2013 that I will not reveal but which you may have inkling about if you are, like me, a student of the genre.\r\n\r\nAll of the above notwithstanding, Scream \u201822 is overall more good than bad. True to its roots, this iteration serves as a deconstruction of the current state of mainstream horror cinema. Specifically, it is a textbook example of a \u201crequel\u201d \u2013 like the last couple of Halloweens, or the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre \u2013, and by \u2018textbook\u2019 I mean that it actually includes a scene where a character literally explains what a requel is and how it works. I also like that it lampshades one of my least favorite tropes, which I call Chekhov's Inhaler.\r\n\r\nI just compared it to Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the fact is that Scream \u201822 comes to join the much better company of Wes Craven\u2019s New Nightmare and last year\u2019s Candyman (suitably, the movie is dedicated to Craven\u2019s memory and gives Jordan Peele a shoutout). This Scream\u2019s oft-repeated mantra is \u201calways go back to the original,\u201d and that\u2019s sage advice because, like Nightmare on Elm Street, this franchise is a brainchild of Craven that began life as thinking man\u2019s horror only to get progressively dumbed down with each new entry \u2013 unlike, say, Friday the 13th, which was born stupid.\r\n\r\nThankfully, this film has been made by people with knowledge of and respect for their source material, and who don\u2019t underestimate the audience\u2019s intelligence. Consequently, when characters send text messages, the words appear on their phone screens as opposed to our movie and TV screens, and when a someone is stabbed, they spill real fake blood instead of a stream of red pixels (and in an age where CGI is the norm, any horror movie that uses practical effects instantly doubles its visceral impact). I will only add that, also like New Nightmare and Candyman \u201821, Scream \u201822 is as much of a return to form as it is a fitting farewell, so here\u2019s hoping that it will live up to its promise that \u201cAfter tonight, no more books, no more movies, no more f***ing Ghostface.\u201d"], ["So if you know anything about the history of the rise of Per\u00f3n in Argentina, and/or have seen the excellent theatrical performance of Rice and Lloyd Webber's \"Evita\" then you will already have the basis for this really rather poor big screen adaptation of both. Madonna is not much of an actress and though her voice manages the songs well enough, her on-screen persona here just falls flat. She is not helped much by a poorly cast Jonathan Pryce as her president - and frankly rather insipid - husband and by the terribly wooden Jimmy Nail as journeyman singer \"Magaldi\". Perhaps only Antonio Banderas salvages anything from his authentic characterisation of the narrator \"Ch\u00e9\" - but otherwise this is a good looking but lacklustre, episodically constructed, series of musical set-pieces that creates an overall feeling of - well, emptiness. Madonna's efforts fail to ignite any sense of the magnetism of this astonishing woman who went from brothel to Presidential palace in such a short time; it pays scant regard to the ruthless (and venal) nature of the prevailing politics of Argentina and in the end proves to be little more than a compendium of good/great songs set to well attired and produced videos.

The staff revolt and that convinces \"McCain\" (Kevin Kline) to send his son \"Vince\" (also CK) to take the helm with his savvy executive \"Willa\" (Jamie Lee Curtis) and pretty soon his new branding policy has just about everything sponsored, including the staff - but, of course, none of this is legit. We just know that the tortoise named after benefactor Bruce Springsteen is not likely to ever see the man. When it appears that \"Vince\" has his hand in the till, too, his father decides to be shot of all of these smelly beasts and just build a golf course. To that end, he arrives on scene to help his two underlings impress the would-be Japanese investors who have their eye on the place. It does have it's funny moments, but I reckon much of those will depend on your fondness for Cleese and his slapstick style of humour. His tall, gangly, appearance frequently being his principle prop - that his his character's innate crassness and stupidity. As the story evolves, we get a bit less of that and more of Kline's mischievous humour and of course Curtis, whom her pal things is interested in him romantically but she is far more enamoured of the zoo and then rather predictably... There's an entertaining supporting cast here - Robert Lindsay, fellow Python Michael Palin and Ronnie Corbett, and they and their animals add the \"aah\" factor the the thing making it watchable, but not really very memorable."], [], [], [], ["This absolutely makes me howl with laughter.

The various local people they meet who initially seem helpful are in fact criminals working together. The wife is kidnapped, the husband is told to pay half a million to get her back alive, and Kurt Russell decides he'd rather fight.\r\n\r\nI found this a rather lame movie. Its believability goes way down when, for example, Kurt Russell rides on the bottom of a moving truck trailer and easily finds his way up to the cab. There are obvious continuity and other errors here: a villain gets a brutal rifle blast to his shoulder, but a few minutes later he's driving a car with no visible problems; a small child is shown playing video games (so it's early evening), but a few minutes later in the same scene dawn breaks.\r\n\r\nAbout the only entertainment here is the acting of J.T. Walsh and M.C. Gainey, who are caricatures but fun ones. Kurt Russell, on the other hand, acts like he's not particularly happy to have taken this role, and is just going through the motions until he gets his paycheck.\r\n\r\nI must say that the purported message, if any, of this film is intriguing. <i>Breakdown</i> seems to be suggesting that decent people from the coasts shouldn't venture into flyover country, since it is the den of rednecks who lie in wait for them.

As the cards get dealt we come to be aware of scumbag predators in his midst, the suspense gets ramped up and we are never quite sure how it's all going to pan out.\r\n\r\nThis has no ideas above its station, and as the heat gets turned up bit by bit, come the thrilling finale you may find it's time to breath easy again...  8/10", "Simple but really solid suspense-thriller with some good sequences especially the finale with great car stunts.

Certainly there's a wide expanse of land in cinema world where film fans reside, where the thought of praising an action film for being \"classic\" cinema is considered treason against the very word. Yet some of the artistry involved in the genre's leading lights is purely sublime, regardless of how bizarre and unlikely the plot is. Enter John Woo's berserker, ear splitting, high octane actioner, Face/Off. Rightly sitting along side the likes of Die Hard and Predator as genre pieces that showcase how good things can be when it all comes together, Woo's movie is as much fun as you could wish to have for over two hours of explosive, fantastical, unadulterated cinema.\r\n\r\nThe plot sees John Travolta's serious family man cop, Sean Archer, devote his life to catching unbalanced maniacal bad guy Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). There's some bad history between the two and when Archer manages to capture both Troy and his equally vile brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola), it would seem to be closure for Archer and his family. However, it's found that the Troy's have left a ticking bomb somewhere in Los Angeles, and if undetected it will flatten L.A. and kill practically everyone. So, Archer undergoes a revolutionary face-swapping procedure with the now comatose Castor and sets about getting the information from the incarcerated Pollux. But wait!, Castor wakes up and turns the tables by assuming Archer's identity, setting the wheels in motion for each man to live the others life until the Face/Off between the pair will decide their respective fate.\r\n\r\nUnbelievable? Of course. Who cares? Well nobody should really, because surely going into a film like this one is expecting the ludicrous. Both Cage and Travolta are superbly realising the spectacular nature of the script, and being mesmerising in the duality of the roles into the bargain. Make no bones about it, Woo and his team have crafted a benchmark action movie. There's a trail of thought that suggests that Woo basically keeps making the same movie, that's a fair enough point, sure enough, all of his staple action sequences and traits are evident in Face/Off. Yet Woo has delved into his characters, given them some flesh on their action bones, and then upped the anti in action set pieces to cloak them in chaotic beauty. From the opening Jet escape/pursuit set up, to the outrageous speed boat finale, the film is one long exhilarating breath taker. Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, Dominique Swain & Nick Cassavetes all file into the background playing important characters who are rightly secondary to the protagonists, while a ream of extras come and go as each are dispatched in a hail of Woo inspired carnage. The pace never sags and the eyes and ears are treated to a vibrancy that is often sadly missing from many other big budgeted action blockbusters.\r\n\r\nThis is a masterpiece of action cinema, so even as a Orson Welles crane shot is a magnificent thing, so it be with the sight of two stunt men flailing thru the air in a spray of exploding water. Oh yes sir, this is a classic alright. 10/10", "A quality all-out action film!\r\n\r\n<em>'Face/Off'</em> isn't one that'll stick out in my memory as something deep meaning, incredibly written or anything of the sort. However, as an action film it's superb. There's barely a chance to rethink what you've just seen due to the prevalent and manic nature of onscreen events. You also have fascinating performances from the two leads.\r\n\r\nNicolas Cage and John Travolta are awesome in this. I won't spoil the plot, but all I will say is that those two bring it to life brilliantly - it felt, at least to me, very believable; which is impressive. Across the opening portion I thought it was going to be Cage stealing the show, but as things progress Travolta really comes up big to match Cage.\r\n\r\nAway from NC and JT, there isn't really anything to scream about cast-wise; although, I gotta give shoutouts to Mike Delfino and Gavin Harris; if you know, you know.\r\n\r\nNothing much more to note, to be honest.

Needless to say, nobody takes kindly to this new pure as the driven snow approach, but gradually \"Exley\" starts to make a bit of headway into the world of organised crime, and to realise just how involved the police are in covering up crimes from fraud to murder. He's also aware that someone is pulling his strings, so some sort of rapport with one of his suspicions colleagues is going to have to be forged if he is to stay alive! Each of these characters get their moment in the sun and that allows us to meet the unscrupulous red-top publisher \"Hudgens\" (an energetic Danny DeVito) and the sophisticated call-girl \"Lynn\" (Kim Basinger) who is quite often pretending to be Veronica Lake! I think my only problem with this film was that I reckoned on who was doing what really early on, so the jeopardy was a little bit compromised. That said, though, it's one of Crowe's more natural performances and Pearce shows us he can deliver gritty and bruising parts well too. I could have been doing with a little more of Basinger's quite intriguing character, just to break up the relentlessness of the story a bit more, but it's a solid adaptation of James Ellroy's uncompromising book that Curtis Hanson presents and it doesn't hang about."], ["_**Low-key Southern Gothic about a struggling family living by the swamps of western Florida**_\r\n\r\nAn emotionally-detached Vietnam vet making a living as a beekeeper on the boggy panhandle of Florida (Peter Fonda) deals with grief, the meaninglessness of life, his son in prison (Tom Wood), a drug-addled daughter-in-law (Christine Dunford), a rebellious granddaughter (Jessica Biel), a new neighbor (Patricia Richardson) and a couple of thugs from Orlando (Steven Flynn and Dewey Weber).\r\n\r\n\"Ulee\u2019s Gold\" (1997) is a slice-of-life Southern Gothic that could be mentioned in the same breath as \u201cOde to Billy Joe\u201d (1976), \u201cThe Man in the Moon\u201d (1991), \u201cSling Blade\u201d (1996), \u201cThe Apostle\u201d (1997) \u201cUndertow\u201d (2004), \u201cBack Roads\u201d (2018) and \u201cThe Devil All the Time\u201d (2020).

I'll watch just about anything he's in and...if he screams and yells a monologue in it, if he delivers a diatribe of rage....yeah I get flashbacks to him screaming: \"I'd take a flame thrower to this place\" and roll my eyes back like a shark in a feeding frenzy.\r\n\r\nOh, yeah, almost forgot, Keanu is in this one too...but for a good slice of the film he doesn't play the most savory of characters and, really, honestly, he just seems too nice to play a lawyer...\r\n\r\n...but despite that he does a pretty good job of exhibiting the ego that has to come with the law profession...just not the vile evilness. So, I can't totally fault him for miscast as I could for Dracula.\r\n\r\nJeffery Jones is in there too and due to recent revelations he totally fits the sleazy lawyer role.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, 1997, the 90s had a way with films that was only really beaten by the 70s and The Devil's Advocate is one of those films that could really only be made in those two decades. Stand alone horror not intended as a franchise piece and one with a twist that asks you to think a little.\r\n\r\nNo way that would be made today and that is a shame.\r\n\r\nI could tout its glory, but really, honestly, the movie could have stank and I wouldn't care thanks to Pacino screaming \"I'm a fan of man!\" It's worth the watch.", "If it looks too good to be true, then it probably is... That's what \"Kevin\" (Keanu Reeves) must learn to appreciate after he is offered a dream job at a prestigious New York legal firm by \"Milton\" (Al Pacino). The potential wealth and the status of his new career path bring out the green-eyed monster in him and together with his reluctant wife \"Mary-Ann\" (Charlize Theron) they are soon living it up in their penthouse apartment with plenty of money but an increasingly dwindling amount of time together. She starts to cool on their arrangement and wants to return to Florida but pretty soon it's clear that \"Kevin\" is addicted - and not to her! Pacino is on good form here as it becomes clear just who his character is, and how adeptly he is pulling all the strings and manoeuvring his new charge into a position that might suggest that the clue is in the title! Now as a life-long lover of the baddie in films, I felt a bit let down by the ending. Faust it isn't - but, to be fair, it still goes as close as Hollywood will probably ever go in portraying a characterisation of the epitome of evil (and offering a wonderful critique on vanity being the downfall of mankind) that actually has a fighting chance of prevailing! Reeves is not the finest actor to grace our screens. Easy on the eye, certainly, but somehow he's just a bit too lightweight here. That might be because, however, Pacino is very much in his element and even though it can drag at times during the almost 2\u00bd hour running time, it's a remarkably compelling ride that still holds up quite well."], [], [], ["\u2018Good lawyer\u2019 is not an oxymoron\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1997 and written & directed by Francis Ford Coppola based on John Grisham\u2019s book, \"The Rainmaker\" stars Matt Damon as an idealistic newbie lawyer in Memphis who takes on a fraudulent insurance company with Danny DeVito as his paralegal and Claire Danes an abused potential love interest. Jon Voight plays the lead lawyer for the insurance company and Roy Scheider the CEO of the corporation.\r\n\r\nBeyond Coppola\u2019s renowned expertise, the cast is stellar, which also includes Mickey Rourke as a smooth legal mogul, Virginia Madsen as a witness and Dean Stockwell & Danny Glover as judges. This was Damon\u2019s break out role as a leading man, paving the way for hits like \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d (1998) and \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d (1998). He\u2019s affable as the principled young lawyer and I liked the way the movie discreetly shows his new home life with the elderly lady, plus other budding relationships.\r\n\r\nThis is decidedly a drama with many courtroom scenes, so don\u2019t except the thrills of other Grisham-based films, like the excellent \u201cThe Firm\u201d (1993) and action-packed \u201cThe Pelican Brief\u201d (1993), although there is an intense action sequence in the second half. While the first half confidently take its time with the drama, throwing in moments of realistic amusement, it segues into a compelling third act. Furthermore, \u201cThe Rainmaker\u201d is a must for anyone interested in the good, the bad and the ugly of the legal arena in America.\r\n\r\nThe movie made $46 million domestically from a budget of $40 million (not including revenue from other countries), but it was still considered a disappoint in comparison to \u201cThe Firm,\u201d which cost roughly the same amount and made six times as much at the box office. Coppola subsequently took a decade break from directing before reentering the fray with the inscrutable \u201cYouth Without Youth\u201d (2007).\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 15 minutes and was shot in the Memphis area of Tennessee, as well as Cleveland, Ohio and California (Alameda, Oakland, San Francisco).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"], [], ["More enjoyable than I would've predicted.\r\n\r\nI was expecting something more mysterious and thrilling, but <em>'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'</em> manages to entertain nicely - despite a long run time, which I thought was going to hamper it but it didn't.\r\n\r\nThe cast are excellent. I really enjoyed John Cusack's performance and Kevin Spacey plays these sorta roles well. The Lady Chablis is another strong performer, while there are roles for a younger Jude Law, Clint Eastwood - the director - regular Geoffrey Lewis and, though very tiny, an on the brink of stardom James Gandolfini.\r\n\r\nWell worth a watch!"], ["Beautiful Romance - Tragedy Unbound.\r\n\r\nIt has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.\r\n\r\nYou jump - I jump.\r\n\r\nTitanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.\r\n\r\nNever let go.\r\n\r\nSo may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10", "Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS \"Titanic\", this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young \"Dawson\" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy \"Rose\" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fianc\u00e9e \"Hockley\" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother \"Ruth\" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, \"Rose\" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young \"Dawson\" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer \"Lovejoy\" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill's Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that's unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship's funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older \"Rose\" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone's grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it's factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it's a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere. Big screen is a must, it really does lose a great deal on a television.", "Awesome", "Titanic is simply a masterpiece. This movie has it all. A tremendous score, deep emotion emphasized by fantastic performances, and incredibly gripping and high-stakes action. There is really something for everyone here.\r\n\r\nBefore I continue my praise of the film, I think it has one glaring weakness: the present-day plot. For me, this just did not work all that well. I understand that it was implemented for the main story to have a more emotional impact, but it was not needed. It added almost thirty minutes to the runtime, which could have been used for more character development in the story or to have a more streamlined plot. Not to mention, the acting in this section was lackluster. That might be a hot take, but it was something that I noticed during my watch.\r\n\r\nBack to the positives. The score is magnificent here. The minute I finished the film, I had an urge to put on this score to be transported back to the Titanic. That does not happen very often to me.\r\n\r\nThe performances are great all around. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's chemistry was perfect. They played off each other so well and really sold this emphatic and rapid love the two shared. The movie spends a lot of time building their relationship and the payoff at the end is worth every second. Billy Zane was an over-the-top asshole, and even though it was cheesy at times, it worked for me. The other ancillary cast members did well, including Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Bill Paxton.\r\n\r\nThis film is really two movies put into one and both of them work excellently. The first half is a charming and cute love story that spends a lot of time on character development, laying the background for motivations and personalities. While this half may have been my favorite, it is slightly outdone by the second half, which is a gripping and suspenseful survival action story. This section is brutal, showing large scale panic and hysteria while also having some incredibly horrific deaths. The chaos was infectious and very scary to watch. Both halves create a great sense of emotion in the audience and complement each other very well.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie had twenty-five years of hype and critical acclaim to live up to, and I am happy to say it passed expectations. Since leaving the theater, I cannot stop thinking about it.\r\n\r\nScore: 96% |\r\nVerdict: Masterpiece\r\n\r\nOn a side note: I did see this movie in 3D during the twenty-five-anniversary re-release. While it was great to see it remastered in 4K, I do think the 3D was poor and unneeded. This did not affect my grade however, since it was not originally designed as a 3D experience, and they 3D did not really take away for my enjoyment.", "Titanic was enjoyable initially, but the constant TV reruns got old fast. I don't even own a TV anymore, and I'm in no hurry to watch it again. Still, it's a good movie, deserving of a 7/10 rating."], [], [], ["When I first saw this movie I thought it was going to be a funny movie. It's actually a serious drama movie. I still liked it but he's a prick in this movie.", "This movie will hit you hard, force you to think about your biases and make you pretty damn uncomfortable. But don't fret, you'll feel better by the end. And Nicholson is so natural as a misanthrope.", "Greg Kinnear (\"Simon\") finds himself in hospital after a brutal bit of gay-bashing, and that means that his small, yappie, dog (\"Jill\") has to be entrusted to his rather curmudgeonly, author neighbour \"Melvin\" (Jack Nicholson) - not exactly the most loving and obvious of choices. Now this latter guy isn't exactly flavour of the month - indeed it's really only waitress \"Carol\" (Helen Hunt) who will put up with his selfish and churlish behaviour. When her young son becomes ill, she has to take time off and \"Melvin\" finds himself truly alone - with no breakfast! The solution, well all three of them take a trip and, well, you can imagine that with Nicholson and Hunt on super form here, Kinnear clearly thriving as their foil, and a screenplay from James L. Brooks at his best, we get an highly entertaining and earthy hybrid of comedy and the most unlikely semblance of romance as the three realise that there is so much more to life than any realised was possible. It's a wee bit long, but the characterisations are rich and engaging and there is a genuine chemistry on screen between all three - and the dog! It's a feel good film that has some serious undercurrents but those are dealt with in a fashion that is potent but not preachy and provides us with food-for-thought wrapped in a smile. Definitely worth watching."], ["**In the name of INNOCENCE !!**\r\n\r\nSometimes i say to myself **this can't happen to me** for the simple reason that it sounds really unfair to be happening..But watching a movie like this changes all perception of right and wrong, fair and unfair.. Only thing that can be fair in this world is your **HEART** !!\r\n\r\nThough **Daniel Day Lewis'** character is not your typical role model from the start, you know that the Heart within isn't black (more so from a scene just before he says 'In all my godforsaken life, I've never known what it was to kill somebody until now')..The transformation of Day Lewis' character from a man who wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself to a man who vows to fight for his father's name is brilliantly heartwarming!\r\n\r\nIt just pains me to see how cruel 'WE' as a species can be to not accept our mistakes, even when we know that it can make someone's life miserable than HELL!!\r\n\r\nIn all the movie is good till the time you don't think of it as someone's life being played out in front of you.As soon as you realize that,it transforms into something you cant just think of as just another brilliant movie.Instead your heart goes out to the people who actually had to go through all this..\r\n\r\nWell directed, superbly acted, brilliant,heart breaking and heart warming at the same time !!\r\n\r\nThose who found it beautiful can go for Hillary Swank's 2010 movie **Conviction** as their next choice of another heartwarming 'eye treat' !", "**A low-key, much-forgotten but well-executed film.**\r\n\r\nThis movie is totally forgotten these days. Well, actually, if you're not native or very close to Ireland, I think the very existence and action of the IRA seems like something that ended many years ago, and it doesn't. It was a recent thing, and it still has marks on people and society. The film focuses, in particular, on the case of the \u201cGuildford Four\u201d and the \u201cMaguire Seven\u201d, which was a group of people who were accused of a bomb attack and of collaborating with the IRA, later proving to be if they were all innocent. The acquittal, however, came too late for the family patriarch, who died in prison. The accused were, almost all, related to each other, family or friendship.\r\n\r\nI don't know the facts very well, although I did read something about the attack and the real case the film was based on, in order to better prepare myself to understand the film and be able to talk about it. As far as I can tell, the film obviously took a lot of liberties to make the story more appealing and dramatic, but nothing that is shockingly out of line with what happened.\r\n\r\nDaniel Day Lewis was still relatively young here, but he was already showing signs of great talent. He is a focused actor and very responsible with his work, who dedicates himself to what he does and commits himself to the character. And we can see how he adapts to the character, and makes it real and believable and human. I also really enjoyed Pete Postlethwaite's work. I think it's particularly notable the way he allowed himself to age in order to play an older, physically impaired character.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is very worthy in its effort to portray the ordeal to which the convicts were subjected, and it does so in a very convincing and credible way. The choice of sets, filming locations and costumes contribute a lot to this. The film works very well on the environment and psyche of the characters, resulting in a dense drama, which may not please those who want a lighter film, but which works very well. The opening credits were well-introduced, even though I don't like the theme song.", "**Oscar for Best Duo Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite**strong text****\r\n\r\nThe movie tries to convey the horrors of injustice, investigation, and rulings under the pretext of emergency laws and terrorism, but the details of these laws make us laugh by today's standards, even not when the film was shown in 1993. The film exposes us to the shock that the terrorism law at this time could have exposed any innocent person for 7 days without charge, and I believe that it is still present in many countless countries on the globe.\r\n\r\nThe film talks about the true story of the Quartet of Guildford and the Seven of Maguire, a very painful human rights story whose chapters begin with the arrest of the Irish young man Gerry Conlon in England and accusing him, along with three others, of carrying out a terrorist attack to bomb a bar in Guildford.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jerry is reckless and has criminal tendencies already, but through the events of the film we realize that Jerry and those with him are innocent, but the investigation and interrogation process shows that it has many impurities and corruption in how to accuse these innocent people.\r\n\r\nIn the Name of the Father, on the surface, talks about justice and the feeling of oppression in the face of injustice. The events of the film are dramatic, revolving around other topics, the most important of which is the relationship between the son and the father and how it develops, as well as how an ugly place such as prison can constitute an opportunity for Jerry to mature in a way that would not have happened if he had not been subjected to injustice.\r\n\r\nThe multiplicity and diversity of the dimensions of the film, in addition to manifestations outside the capabilities of the planet in two scenes and the performance of two actors, who gave the film great importance and a special place for me.\r\n \r\nIf there was an Oscar for best acting duo, the Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite partnership would have given them blindfolded.\r\n\r\nThe character of Giuseppe Conlon has no faults. Even the story of his name, which allowed a wonderful scene to be told, was charming and incredible. He had a strange state of coherence in light of the circumstances in which he was, and in light of his background full of downwardness, which made him follow the rules and laws strictly so as not to violate the law. This flatness made his son Jerry view him as a weakness. But when Jerry realized when he tested himself in facing the same challenges his father faced, he saw his father, Giuseppe Conlon, gain ground and respect in every situation.\r\n\r\nThis movie is incredibly wonderful. It dazzled me and made me follow the events without getting bored."], ["Directed by Steven Spielberg, the name is enough. He enjoys immense love and justified appreciation. It\u2019s not just a rumour, but his name transcends to million footfalls to theatres and multiple OTT replays. But this movie is special because as a Jew Spielberg felt the pain of Holocaust and thus this was personal. Spielberg\u2019s paternal grandparents were Jews from Ukraine. I really hope things cool down very soon in Ukraine and somebody someday make a film on the crisis in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nAfter watching \u201cThe Kashmir Files\u201d I felt like watching the list because I wanted to see how we can make better movies without the propaganda. The Kashmir Files is necessary minus the very few political flaws and propaganda it subtly injects into its viewers. Asking the questions is not anti-national and not all JNU people come with an agenda. Kashmir Files tells many truths and ought to be told but also hides a lot of the actual/factual truths. Just like a dictator it blatantly shows only the side they want to without any iota of balance.\r\n\r\nBut Schindler\u2019s List is different because it never lets the bleakness of the Holocaust overwhelm its important theme of fighting for the common good. The director says, \u201cMy primary purpose in making Schindler\u2019s List was for education. The Holocaust had been treated as just a footnote in so many textbooks or not mentioned at all. Millions knew little if anything about it. Others tried to deny it happened at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nKeneally\u2019s best-known work, Schindler\u2019s Ark was published in 1982; also known as Schindler\u2019s List and film released in 1993, tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved more than 1,300 Jews from the Nazis. . Liam Neeson plays very well Schindler however shows his true side that he was a playboy and so on. He was not a saint. He cheated on his wife, drank excessively and spied for Abwehr, the counter-espionage arm of the Wehrmacht (German army), in Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nBut the true characteristics of human beings cannot be spliced even in the most fascist regimes. Sometimes character flaws bring in real joy, excitement and belief. Steven Spielberg\u2019s movie, Schindler\u2019s List, while important, impressive and admirable in many respects, tries to show the true face of propaganda and mass bullshit and how an entire nation can be mass brainwashed to fuel hatred amoung it\u2019s people and bring a great nation down. Something India and Indians need to really ponder upon.\r\n\r\nAfter Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Oskar Schindler sets up an enamelware factory in Krakow that used a combination of Jewish workers interred by the Germans and free Polish workers. His initial interest, of course, was to make money. But as time went on, he grew to care about his Jewish workers, particularly those with whom he came into contact on a daily basis. In addition, helping Jews became a way to fight against what he viewed as disastrous and brutal policies emanating from Adolf Hitler and the SS. Oskar Schindler convinced German authorities his factory was vital and that he needed trained workers. But Schindler did not author or dictate the list instead, Marcel Goldberg, a Jewish \u201cclerk\u201d compiled it. There is a line in the movie which goes like, \u201cThat\u2019s not just good old fashioned Jew hate talk. Its policy now\u201d and it hits hard and makes us aware that nothing has changed in present too. Itzhak Stern, played in the movie by Ben Kingsley was one of the most powerful character more of culmination of lot of people at that time. Oskar Schindler was a great man publicly and a not so great man privately but he saved the lives of more than 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust and that\u2019s why a movie has been made on him. The imperfections in his character and the nuances in the historical record only make his story more remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s budget was just $22 million. No one had ever made a profitable film about the Holocaust. Spielberg himself didn\u2019t take a salary, calling it \u201cblood money.\u201d Something Vivek Agnihotri and makers of \u201cThe Kashmir Files\u201d should ponder upon. As I write this Kashmir Files has already touched 250 Cr. Such sensitive films should come with not just spontanity but also empathy which is found in Spielberg and lacks in Agnihotri\u2019s.\r\n\r\nThis movie reminded me of another Spielberg movies which moved and caved in Bridge of Spies. Bridge was about the fine art of negotiation and the List is about the fine art of \u201cGratitude\u201d you will hear this word a lot in the Schindler\u2019s List. I felt both the movies very similar and fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe use of black and white cinematography also makes me think of \u201cKOTA FACTORY\u201d both shot in black and white to resemble the dark and hollowness of the subject material. Art does make you uncomfortable and that\u2019s it\u2019s Dharma and Karma but propoganda does give you only the bigoted narration with giving the example that his master is always a good guy.\r\n\r\nIn one scene, Schindler implores Goeth to spray water into the cars on a hot day to help the dehydrated Jews inside. Goeth tells him that to do so would give false hope\u2014a clear implication that the trains deliver Jews to their deaths.The lists become increasingly ominous during sorting exercises to determine who is fit to work or who is \u201cessential\u201d and who is not. Those deemed \u201cunessential\u201d are placed on the list to be evacuated to extermination camps. Stern\u2019s name appears on a list sending him to Auschwitz. When Schindler saves him, an SS officer mentions that it doesn\u2019t matter which Jew gets on the train, and that keeping track of names just means more paperwork. This disregard for names and particularity symbolizes the extent to which the Nazis dehumanized Jews. Schindler\u2019s list is one that saves lives. The Nazis\u2019 lists represent evil and death, but Schindler\u2019s list represents pure good and life. In an ironic twist, the final list in the film is a list that Schindler\u2019s workers give to him\u2014a list of their signatures vouching for Schindler as a good man, to help him if Allied soldiers catch him. The saved in turn become saviors.\r\n\r\nThe one-armed man who thanks Schindler for employing him and making him \u201cessential\u201d is shot in the head by an SS officer as he shovels snow the next day. Blood flows from his head, staining the surrounding snow. In a later scene, Goeth orders the execution of a Jewish woman engineer who tells Goeth of a fatal construction error. Her blood, too, pours from her head and darkens the snow around her. The blood pouring from the victims\u2019 heads is both literally and metaphorically the lifeblood being bled out of the Jewish race. In yet another scene, Goeth attempts to execute a rabbi working at the Plasz\u00f3w labor camp. The rabbi stays kneeling as Goeth again and again attempts to shoot him in the head. But the gun jams, and the rabbi is spared, symbolizing the tenuous protection the Schindlerjuden had and the fine line between life and death.\r\n\r\nThe film talks about the corruption of not just money but hearts and minds too. It shows us privileges and different aspects of life while keeping humanity before profits and ideologies. Intricacies of personal and professional lives are intertwined here for the good sake.\r\n\r\nThe film ends with \u2013 \u201cWHOEVER SAVES ONE LIFE, SAVES THE WORLD ENTIRE.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe actual Oskar Schindler died in 1974 and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion. He is the only former member of the Nazi Party to be honored in this way. He and his wife Emilie were named Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1993, something that would be hard to believe could happen without the film highlighting his life. \r\n\r\nAs we all know, Spielberg and the film went on to win several Academy Awards for Schindler\u2019s List, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film also won for Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing. Spielberg would win another Best Director Oscar for Saving Private Ryan five years later, but for him what happened with Schindler would be his crowning achievement. \r\n\r\nSchindler\u2019s List is a rare movie whose legacy is just as important as its existence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the lasting legacy of the film, aside from tolerance, is the image of the girl in red. During the liquidation of the ghetto scene, we see a little girl wandering. She serves as the person Schindler and the audience fixate on. The weight of the atrocity that we carry as viewers.When prompted to talk about one of the only color moments in the film, the girl in red, Spielberg told USA Today, \u201cIn (Thomas Keneally\u2019s) book, Schindler couldn\u2019t get over the fact that a little girl was walking during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. While everyone was being put on trucks or shot in the street, one little girl in a red, red coat was being ignored by the SS.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Spielberg, that came to symbolize the blind eye world leaders turned to the murders going on in Europe. \u201cTo me, that meant that Roosevelt and Eisenhower\u2014and probably Stalin and Churchill\u2014knew about the Holocaust\u2026 and did nothing to stop it. It was almost as though the Holocaust itself was wearing red.\u201d Same repeats in Ukraine too.\r\n\r\nSpielberg helped develop and found The Shoah Foundation. It furthered the education and established \u201cThe Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation\u201d to document the testimonies of thousands of survivors. For Spielberg, he wanted future generations to have these eyewitness accounts to serve as a permanent record. He hoped that there would never be a time we saw Nazism and fascism on the rise again.

Well here, Steven Spielberg takes that dangerous occupation and scales it up somewhat as the eponymous Czech industrialist and arms manufacturer (Liam Neeson) finds his increasing revulsion to the brutality of their new occupying power driving him, with the able assistance of his Jewish factory manager \"Stern\" (Ben Kingsley), to find ways to keep them from being routinely slaughtered. Getting them out is not really an option, so he invents ways of convincing the authorities that they are more useful alive and decently fed/housed - even suggesting the usefulness of children's small fingers to polish shell casings - to avoid them being deported to the now fully functioning Auchwitz extermination camp. The story is history but the manner in which it is delivered here is poignant and potent. Schindler's gradual shift from a venally induced indifference to one of active concern is well handled by Neeson's considered performance and Kingsley works well as his low-level but crucial co-conspirator. Plaudits must also go to Ralph Fiennes with, I think, the best portrayal of his career as the odious Commandant Goeth who combines just about every element of the worst in human nature into one ghastly individual eliciting a palpable degree of loathing. Does it need to be 3\u00bc hours long? Well I'm not so sure about that, and there are times when the repetitive oppressiveness of their gruelling environment risks de-sensitising the message a little, but for the most part the abusive and terrifying lives led by the Jewish prisoners and the increasingly perilous path being taken by those trying to help is well held together with some stunning cinematography and an untypical John Williams score. It's definitely a big screen occasion - somehow television reduces it's impact, so if you can see it in a cinema. Either way, it does offer some salutary lessons in man's inhumanity, and humanity to our fellow man!"], [], [], ["This film defies being rated on a scale of 1 through 5 - it's truly almost impossible to do so. I want to rate this a 5 and I want to rate this a 3 at the same time. Both would be wrong though so I'll just settle in the middle. Aronofsky has given us many brainsick films in the past, but this is on a whole other level. Remember the batshit crazy climax of _Requiem for a Dream_? Multiply that by 50 and you get the batshit crazy climax of mother! - and that is a *huge* understatement.\r\n\r\nI don't really want to talk too much about the film's plot or the finale as not much about the film is known to the public at this point. It's absolutely worth it to go into this film as blind as possible or maximum effectiveness. All I'll say is that the _Rosemary's Baby_ influenced poster and marketing so far is a big curve ball - it has nothing to do with that film although Polanski horror elements are clearly an inspiration to Aronofsky here.\r\n\r\nI do want to praise three specific elements of this film that worked the best for me: (1) The sound design was absolutely magnificent. There is no score to this film - not quite sure what J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hansson did here - but the sound design is eerie as hell and supremely memorable. (2) The production design is next level. The house in this film is basically the co-lead (you'll see what I mean when you watch it) and it evolves drastically over the course of the film (again, you'll see what I mean when you watch it). Excellent art direction that I haven't stopped thinking about all day. (3) The performance from Jennifer Lawrence is harrowing as she really gave herself to this film and to Aronofksy's vision, but the performance that stuck with me is the one from Michelle Pfeiffer. She really embodied her character and even though she's only in maybe the first 60% of the film, she left a deep impression on the rest of it as well. Her character is crucial to the film and she injected such mystery and gravity to the events that followed her exit.\r\n\r\nWill soon watch this again and hopefully have more meaningful thoughts. It's hard to say too much right now when hardly anyone has seen the film yet, but believe me, there is a lot to be said about _mother!_", "_mother!_, a movie title with no upper case letters.

It seemed like a total waste of time.  The plot was non-existent.  Confusing.

People wouldn't have been so confused about it, the critics would have panned the hell out of it and ten years down the line it may have had a cult following.\r\n\r\nInstead, you have a crap movie trying to pass itself off as art house...and all the pretension that comes with that.", "**_Looks great, awesome themes, tedious storytelling_**\r\n\r\nA renowned poet and his much younger wife (Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem) live in a huge old house in the sticks.

Daftness also comes by way of the superior officers prancing around training camp in the world's tightest shorts, one would think they must be on their way to \"The Blue Oyster Bar\"...\r\n\r\nThings are further compounded by the fact that as committed as Moore is in the title role, and she is and gives it her all, one can't buy into the characterisation because you simply are watching Demi Moore the actress. Shaved head and beefed up she may be, but this is still one of the highest paid actresses of her era, the characterisation thin on the ground with no depth.

When a misfire broke out in town, Freddy jumped into it with the help of Lt. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro). This seems like a big leap of the career-stuck sheriff.

However, despite the actor's efforts, the truth is that it would never be the same, nor could it be, and sometimes the jokes are so forced that they simply lose their effectiveness.\r\n\r\nIn this film, Bean found work at the National Gallery in London. A job that is apparently safe, if we consider that the character gets into trouble even with the simplest tasks: he is a watchman and sits in a chair while visitors and tourists walk around. The problem is that, in the case of Bean, we know that things are going to get complicated almost by magic: and the gallery directors are very happy when the curators of a Californian museum acquire a remarkable painting by an American author and an expert to talk about her at a presentation ceremony: Bean is the one the directors most want to see behind her back, so they don't even hesitate. From here, disaster is waiting to happen.\r\n\r\nLet's be honest: the film is funny and works reasonably well. It's a good quality comedy, and it was also successful at the box office (although that's not synonymous with quality, because it's also true that there are many much worse films, like \u201cTed\u201d, which also sold well). We can't point out defects that it doesn't have at all. For me, the biggest defect of this film is the audience, which created very high expectations at the expense of the gigantic success of the fourteen episode miniseries that Atkinson created in the 90s. Anyone waiting to have the same experience with This film will always be disappointing. Things aren't the same, they don't work the same way and everything is a little more exaggerated and forced. However, it would be difficult for an American production to make a feature-length film with Bean any other way.\r\n\r\nThe film takes great care and attention with the sets, cinematography, costumes and effects used, but it is still within the \u201cstandard\u201d of light films that the USA released at this time. It's nothing truly exceptional. Throughout the film, situations occur that attempt to recreate Atkinson's style of humor, as he does his best to avoid talking, but still has to do so occasionally. We can say that the actor made a huge effort, but that he also encountered problems adapting his recipe to the North American cinematic style. It's like trying to dress a child in an adult man's costume: it will look bizarre, disharmonious and ugly, but he's dressed.\r\n\r\nIn between, we also have to positively highlight the work of Peter MacNicoll, and of course, being a historian and an art lover, I have to congratulate the use of the occasion to make known to the general public a magnificent painting that really exists: Arrangement in Gray and Black n\u00ba 1.

There is no shock left for us to feel; we have seen it all before and just like last time, the folks getting gobbled up are largely deserving of their fates. Winona Ryder's (\"Call\") adds a little quirkiness to the plot later on, but otherwise this is all just completely forgettable, churned out sci-fi that, though quite quickly paced and complete with some great special effects, offers nothing new.", "I can't believe how the Alien franchise has been politicized in two directions by the same side of the political debate.\r\n\r\nI pointed out Ripley as an example of a strong female lead that everyone loves, and that got me the ire of the cancel culture folks. It's not politically correct to like Ripley when you have worse and more modern strong female leads.\r\n\r\nBut, I really didn't like \"Alien: Resurrection\" and that earned me the wrath of the exact same people!!!!\r\n\r\nSo, I guess the basic rule of thumb is that you are only supposed to like the bad movies to be politically correct?\r\n\r\nI don't know how it works.\r\n\r\nFor those of you that are rational, \"Alien: Resurrection\" stinks. For starters, Ripley is supposed to be dead. Bringing her back the way they did, well, that's not only an insult to us fans that love her, but to Ripley as well.\r\n\r\nSeeing her like that left a sour taste in my mouth.\r\n\r\nAnd though I always loved and will likely always love both Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman, and though they did as good of a job as they could...they couldnt act their way around a horrible script and a terrible premise.\r\n\r\nYou can't blame the actors for this nightmare. You can see that they are actually trying to salvage something from the mess. In the end, you have to blame it on the fact that this is an Alien movie that no one asked for, and it's a plot that should never have been.\r\n\r\nIn 1997 this movie was trash. In 2018, however, it's fresh air considering the Alien movies we have now. But still, I'm giving it the 97 rating.\r\n\r\nit was over at 3, no need to insult a stellar franchise.", "**Despite some merits and the effort of the director and cast, it is the weakest of the Alien films.**\r\n\r\nThis was the fourth film in the Alien franchise, and the last one for many years. The franchise started well and developed nicely into three films that, while not without criticism or problems, work really well and have a lot of coherence as a joint work. The fourth film, unfortunately, completely breaks with this coherent and harmonious union.\r\n\r\nJean Pierre Jeunet has done a pleasant and undoubtedly strong job. It is one of the films that made the director's career and that we remember when we talk about him. And there is no doubt that he managed to prevent this film from being even worse, putting great effort into his work, coordinating his technical team and guiding a strong and highly competent cast.\r\n\r\nSigourney Weaver is back with the character that launched her career, despite the very understandable reluctance to accept the project (after all, Ellen Ripley had died in the immediately preceding film). She herself stated, without any fuss, that she agreed to do the film because she was handsomely paid. I don't blame her. For an actor, who lives off the jobs he's called to, and who never quite knows when they'll appear, it's important to accept lucrative opportunities. And we have to be honest, the actress committed herself to the work and did everything to give us a performance at the same level as we have seen in previous films. However, she unfortunately did not have been material with the same quality. Winona Ryder, who was experiencing a particularly happy period in her career, is also here, and she also gives us a very reasonable job, although far from matching the great performances she achieved in other films of the same period. Ron Perlman, fairly unknown, is in good shape, as is Brad Dourif.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film is frankly inferior to its predecessors, and considering that all this is a set that should be cohesive and homogeneous, it is difficult not to make some comparisons. It's a film that continues to rest solidly on very strong visual and special effects, which are very reasonably done considering the age of the film and what has gone before it. It's not as spectacular as its predecessors, and any originality has been lost, but it's not bad, and it's worth seeing. Unfortunately, for a horror film with monsters on the loose, the action scenes are sparse, and seem very weak copies of what was done in the other films (to give an example, this film also has an alien sucked through a hole, in a very similar way to what happened in the first film). The tension and suspense are still present, and it's a truly unnerving film, which can be unsettling for some people. However, the really effective scares are few, even if it is a more visual and bloody film than its predecessors. An excellent cinematography helps to set this all up reasonably well.\r\n\r\nBetween merits and demerits, what really has no salvation is the script. The story we see in this film, in my opinion, not only has a very poor articulation with the films that preceded it, but actually ends up contradicting them. All it takes is to bring back to life, through a rather lame artifice, a character we saw to die with dignity. If this film needed Ellen Ripley \u2013 and indeed it needed, she was the character who gave the previous films its strength \u2013 the most logical thing was not to make a sequel, but a prequel or a spin-off with a story that was credible and logical, considering what was already done."], [], ["The aptly named \"Harry Block\" (Woody Allen) is a seriously lapsed Jewish writer suffering from constipation of the typewriter. Adding to his woes is a nervousness about an impending honour from his alma mater (from where he was unceremoniously expelled) and the fact that his personal life makes Henry VIII's look like \"Bertie and Elizabeth\". Of course, \"Harry\" is seeing a therapist (Robert Harper) and with just a day before his conferment, he realises that his entire shambolic life is a result of his inability to fall in love. He likes women, he likes sex but he doesn't really like commitment, wanting always to treat a relationship like something he can buy in, or return to, Walmart. That's the basis of this story of a flawed individual that using a series of statically directed sit-com style scenarios takes us thorough twenty-four hours in the manic life of the shallow and unlikeable individual. I have never really been a fan of Woody Allen and this did nothing to change that. Granted his writing is quick fired and his observations potent at times, but his sense of humour is just too crass for me. There's nothing at all subtle about it, no cleverness - and the opening scenes of this set a scene for what I thought became increasingly puerile and predictable. A sort of slickly-delivered linguistic slapstick. Vulgar can be fun, but not when it's got some pseudo-intellectual underpinning about cause and effect of an human behaviour that becomes more and more contrived to fit the narrative the auteur wants to deliver. Are the jump cuts just there to divert our attention from the dwindling characterisations and increasing soapy melodrama? He doesn't imbue his character with anything I could care about, and though I did think Judy Davis and a cast of many reliable faces did their best to shore it all up, in the end it's very appropriately titled - it just doesn't happen quite quickly enough."], ["Quentin Tarantino, a genius who brought us Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs returned with Jackie Brown, a tale of deception in the world of drugs-smuggling business. Heavily inspired by the 1970\u2019s blaxploitation flicks, it tells the story of a stewardess, Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) who was pinned inside the cash-smuggling business as she\u2019s tormented between two choices, becoming a cash-mule and in the end snitching her own boss or being smart by keeping the money for herself. It\u2019s quite rare to see a film where the leading role is a female. Even though the plot relies quite much on Elmore Leonard\u2019s novel Rum Punch, Tarantino really did great in giving his own personal touch to the existing materials by adding up a fine composition of clever dialogue, dark humor, and even the ultra violence in the forms of gun-battling badasses, drugs, and absolutely very graphic language, making it absolutely a typical Tarantino flick.\r\n\r\nThis film also possessed its own controversies that put Tarantino in the prosecuted seat because of his frequent use of the word \u201cnigger\u201d. This serious accusation was made by Spike Lee who furiously (while busy counting) noted that was used 38 times, excessively, throughout the film and he claimed that it\u2019s an abuse and definitely an insult to black people. Apart from the above accusation, in my opinion, Jackie Brown, with its strong casts  from Pam Grier, Bridget Fonda, Robert Forester, and Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton and Robert De Niro really add up to the greatness of the film.  The way I see it, every cast here is given a complex set of character for us to study. Both De Niro and Keaton, despite their small roles, they remain favorable and memorable.", "Booyah!\r\n\r\nComing as it did after critical darlings \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction\", it's perhaps not surprising that Quentin Tarantino's next film failed to - at the time - scale those giddy heights. Yet on reflection these days, when viewing Tarantino's career over twenty years later, it's one of his tightest works.\r\n\r\nWorking from master pulper Elmore Leonard's novel \"Rum Punch\", Tarantino had a concrete base from which to build on, which he does with aplomb. Cleaving close to the spirit of Leonard, \"Jackie Brown\" is rich with glorious chatter, each conversation either pings with a biting hard ass edge, or alternatively deconstructing the vagaries of the human condition.\r\n\r\nOh for sure this is a talky pic, but nothing is ever twee or pointless, for it's a film that pays rich rewards to those prepared to fully grasp the characters on show, to be aware that all is building towards the final third. It's then here where the story brings about its stings, with a complex operation cloaked in double crosses and evasive captures, of violence and more...\r\n\r\nThere's a wonderful portion of the story that sees Tarantino play the same sequence out from different character perspectives, but this is not self indulgency. Tarantino reins himself in, not letting stylisations detract from the characters we are so heavily involved with. His other triumph is bringing Pam Grier and Robert Forster to the fore, who both deliver terrific performances. It's through these pair, with their deft characterisations, where Jackie Brown is most poignant and purposeful. \r\n\r\nIs it a case of \"Jackie Brown\" being undervalued in Tarantino's armoury? Perhaps it is? For it's ageless, holding up as a piece of intelligent work of note, and well worth revisiting by anyone who hasn't seen it since it was first released. 9/10", "Outstanding, no two ways about it.\r\n\r\n<em>'Jackie Brown'</em> makes for a great watch, I personally found the pacing excellent; which is obviously important for a 2hr 30min+ production. The cast knock it out the park, while the story is riveting. It's worthy of the hype, one of Quentin Tarantino's best no doubt.\r\n\r\nPam Grier is fantastic as the titular character, Samuel L. Jackson is quality as well - the scenes that those two share are top notch. Robert Forster plays a much larger part than I was expecting at the beginning, which is only a massive plus as he gives a great performance. You also have the likes of Michael Keaton, Chris Tucker and Robert De Niro involved - I actually would've like to have seen De Niro used more meaningfully.\r\n\r\nNot much more needs to be said, I'd only be repeating what everyone else has positively said about this. It's brilliant.", "Samuel L. Jackson really steals the show here as the petty criminal \"Ordell\". He sells guns - gradually accumulating a small fortune which he smuggles in from Mexico using the services of the eponymous air stewardess (Pam Grier). When his well oiled machine starts to splutter, he avails himself of bail bondsman \"Cherry\" (Robert Forster) and so starts a complex story that sees people drop like flies; policeman \"Ray\" (Michael Keaton) get involved and we build to a sting operation not seen since Paul Newman in 1973. A great soundtrack that doesn't overwhelm some good performances, a pithy and dryly humorous script with the foul-mouthed tirades from the rather ruthless \"Ordell\" working well to develop his character and a really solid effort from Grier as the middle-woman who is very capable of thinking on her feet! There are a couple of scenes - not least between \"Melanie\" (Bridget Fonda) and \"Louis\" (Robert De Niro) - that are genuinely laugh out loud and the threads knit cleverly and from left field a bit at the denouement. This might be my favourite Tarantino film - it has pace, style, character and engaging contributions from a cast that work and deliver well together."], [], [], [], ["I must have watched this film three or four times now, and each time it takes me the first half hour to recall. It's an intriguing story rooted in Aramaic mythology but applied to 20th century Philadelphia. \"Hobbes\" (Denzel Washington) is a detective who worked on the case of serial killer \"Edgar Reese\" that saw him captured and executed. Not long after this supposed closure, however, other - very similar - crimes start to occur and he and his partner \"Jonesy\" (John Goodman) are perplexed. He keeps hearing a song - the same song the deceased sang as he died, but the people singing it are different. There is something mysterious afoot that can inhabit a body, move effortlessly and invisibly from one to another - and it seems to have \"Hobbes\" in it's sights. Desperate to shield his family from this evil, he must try to find a way to destroy it before it destroys him. It all takes too long to get going, and Goodman is not particularly well cast, but once we have the gist of the plot then Washington and director Gregory Hoblit turn in quite a well put together story, using the photography well to give us a perspective from our menace whilst effectively conveying the sense of nimble mobility this creature possesses as the resourceful \"Hobbes\" tries to combat it. Donald Sutherland pops up now and again, to no real purpose, indeed much of the supporting cast sort of blend into the wallpaper of this exercise that really plays to the strengths of an on-form Washington delivering a solid and interesting theme.

McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the \"mental illness\" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.\r\n\r\n\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't 'get' a lot of the insights the film conveys.\r\n\r\nThe movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their \"therapy\" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be \"dealt with.\"\r\n\r\nA lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched \"isn't that bad\" or that \"she was only trying to do her job\", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.\r\n\r\nThe filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in \"Mommie Dearest,\" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).\r\n\r\nMcMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.\r\n\r\nNurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that \"appearances\" are not about inward reality and, worse, \"the letter kills.\"\r\n\r\nDespite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it \u2013 the humble \u2013 not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).\r\n\r\nNo review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of \u201cChief\u201d Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A", "_One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest_ tells the story of a criminal, Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who pleads insanity in the attempt to get a more lenient sentence. Sent to a mental hospital, he livens up the otherwise monotonous lives of the patients, much to the ire of the strict head nurse, Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher).\r\n\r\n_One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest_ clean swept the Oscars in 1976, taking home the five biggest prizes as only the second film to do so since It Happened One Night.\r\n\r\nIn reality, it is an extremely frustrating film. Pitched as a \"man against the system\", McMurphy is clearly written to be chaotic and bring some colour to the otherwise black and white world of the hospital. Meanwhile, Ratched is the oppressive villain sticking regimentally to routine despite the suffering of the patients.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, the opposite appears true. While McMurphy is disruptive, he often comes across as a bully, coercing the patients against their will. Even as he gains some of their trust, he continues to manipulate until he has a majority behind him. Ratched on the other hand is the voice of reason. While the medical practices are undeniably oppressive by modern standards, she remains cool, calm and collected at all times when dealing with her patients.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Nicholson does give a career defining performance, fully deserving of his Academy Award. It is often his body language or subtle facial expressions that betray the mischief of McMurphy, and these human qualities cannot be expressed in a script. He switches from the chaos and disorder of a profanity-ridden baseball commentary to the benign friendship of some of his fellow interns with consummate professionalism.\r\n\r\nHe leads an all-star cast including both Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd, but the other standout is debutant Brad Dourif as the stuttering and immature Billy Bibbit. And, whenever the film veers towards bedlam, it is Louise Fletcher - who reportedly took on the role while other bigger names in Hollywood declined it for fear of being cast as the villain - who brings it back to earth with strong and capable acting.\r\n\r\nOverall, a mixed bag.

Unfortunately, this film is inferior, much inferior, and in good part due to the poor level of comedy, which abuses sexual and scatological humor to make jokes, increasingly predictable and unfunny.\r\n\r\nI really think that the film's problem is in the script, a piece of garbage that shouldn't have been used for anything other than a good bonfire. Another problem is the departure of Tom Shadyac and the replacement by Steve Oedekerk, a director who is incapable of having the same creativity and comic spirit. These two problems doomed the film.\r\n\r\nJim Carrey turns out to be the least guilty. He continues to be a huge actor and carries the entire film on his shoulders with a panache and ability that is difficult to match, as far as comedies are concerned. I think he embarked too much on easy humor, he let himself go down a less friendly and less familiar path than would be desirable, but even so, he deserves a positive note. Simon Callow is the only supporting actor to earn a good grade, with the rest being average.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is poor. The sets and costumes are predictable and not pretty, the recreation of the African environment has aromas of falsehood (as if we were watching a school theater play and not a big budget film) and the effects are poor. The amount of animals involved is remarkable, and the animals deserve all the attention as they are, almost, actors in their own right."], ["_**\"Can't imagine there's meanness; can't imagine one lie\"**_  \r\n\r\n\"Powder\" was the first of two films that came out in 1995-1996 dealing with a gifted individual who is super-smart and has paranormal powers; the second was \"Phenomenon\" with John Travolta. \"Powder\" is the superior. While \"Phenomenon\" is good, \"Powder\" reaches for greatness and, in some ways, achieves it, even while it\u2019s marred by a few dubious moments.\r\n\r\nSean Patrick Flanery plays a hairless albino teen in East Texas, nicknamed Powder, who's discovered living in a basement after his grandfather's sudden death. As a ward of the state, he is placed in a boy's school where his uniqueness stirs up trouble.\r\n\r\nFor a film like this to work you have to buy into the character, and this is one of the movie's strengths. Flanery reveals his acting expertise in his convincing portrayal of the shy, gifted teen. Flannery's Powder stands strong with the greatest misfits in cinema, like Nimoy's Spock and Hank's Forrest Gump.\r\n\r\nActually, the acting is good across the board: Lance Henriksen as the hardened-but-open sheriff, Mary Steenburgen as a psychologist who grows to really care for Powder in a motherly way, Jeff Goldblum as a fervent science teacher who's astonished, Bradford Tatum as Powder's main enemy at school, Brandon Smith as a redneck deputy who instinctively hates him, but actually fears him, and the beautiful redhead Missy Crider, Powder's fellow student and potential love interest.\r\n\r\nRoger Ebert dissed the film for a number of reasons, one being Powder's enemy's don't learn from him. On the contrary, one enemy makes a 180 after being enlightened, but ultimately reverts back to his former base mentality. This happens all the time in real life. On another occasion Powder does something miraculous and you can clearly see the change on his enemy's face, the realization & acceptance. Whether this will prove to be a lasting change or temporary, isn\u2019t revealed.\r\n\r\nEbert also complained that Powder's electrical tricks upstage his emotional insights. Really? I think it's the reverse. While the electrical tricks are there to maintain the attention of those with ADHD, it's the film's potent insights that stay with the viewer. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the electrical tricks, but they're way too overdone to be realistic. At the same time, I understand why the writer/director (Victor Salva) included them: this is a MOVIE, not real life; it's meant to transfer ideas AND entertain, and it does both pretty effectively.\r\n\r\nEbert also griped that the ending is unsatisfying the more you think about it. Actually, the ending makes a powerful statement and is reminiscent of the spectacular translations of Elijah and Enoch in the Bible. Let's just say Powder was too good, too spiritual, for the simpleminded and mundane.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying the film doesn't have flaws or eye-rolling moments, but they can be overlooked in view of the big picture and the film's successes.\r\n\r\nAs for the paranormal phenomena featured in the story, like psychokinesis, telepathy, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls \"the word of knowledge,\u201d although some of these are exaggerated in the film I have a secret:\r\n\r\nThey're real.\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in SE Texas and runs 111 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"], ["This would have only been ordinary because it's simply adequately directed, has an entire cast of unknowns save for the star, and is from a clich\u00e9-riddled script, but this is honestly one of Michelle Pfeiffer's more interesting performances. While she's not entirely convincing as a career-Marine, she's certainly more so than Demi Moore, who tried the stunt not long afterwards, and she's certainly believable as a caring teacher. An intriguing film for Simpson and Bruckheimer to be associated with, this was back in the day, after her career-defining 'Catwoman' role in 'Batman Returns' that she was still getting great starring roles (I greatly look forward to checking her out opposite Daniel Day-Lewis in 'The Age of Innocence'). My favourite work of hers will always be in 'Scarface', but this is right up there IMHO--some really fine acting by her. It's simply a shame only one note was asked of her--had it been a more multi-dimensional character (ie., love or family interests--I've read a possible romance scene with Andy Garcia was left on the cutting room floor so they could focus on her interaction with the students), it would have been even more inviting to watch.", "So cheesy, but still fairly good mind you.\r\n\r\nI did find myself cringing a decent amount throughout <em>'Dangerous Minds'</em> though, not necessarily in a negative way but just due to some rather sickly scenes. I found Michelle Pfeiffer's performance to be, for the most part, pleasant, though there are a few scenes where she overacts ever so slightly - in my opinion, of course.\r\n\r\nAway from Pfeiffer, there isn't much to shout about. George Dzundza (Hal) has a few moments, as do the likes of Renoly Santiago, Bruklin Harris and Wade Dominguez. The lead is the only one who keeps things interesting, though.\r\n\r\nThe plot is fine, as is everything else really. They use \"Gangsta's Paradise\" (at least?) three times which is undoubtedly, absolutely three times too little - what a banger of a song that is from Coolio and L.V."], ["**One of the best teen movies ever.**\r\n\r\nTeen movies can really be a terrible plague. I've had other occasions where I didn't spare them criticism, and generally it's a style of cinema that I dislike a lot for its sheer stupidity. However, this comedy about a group of spoiled rich girls is a positive example, a film for teenagers that manages to have quality and grace, while being a satire, quite critical, on the materialism and consumerism of elite teenagers.\r\n\r\nAmy Heckerling had a brilliant idea to make a modern adaptation of the novel \u201cEmma\u201d, by Jane Austen. Any and all of the author's material is guaranteed to be good, and if it is well used, it usually gives good results. And indeed, the essence of this book is here: a spoiled and superficial girl who learns more about life, finds true love and the most genuine kindness and altruism. This is the transformation we see in Cher, the blonde and exuberant heroine of this film. She lives with her father, a lawyer who doesn't seem to pay much attention to his daughter but who, in fact, has a way of doing so. And it is at school, and in the complicated universe of popularity-obsessed teenagers, that Cher moves for most of the film. Rich and beautiful, she has no problem assuming herself as a leader, at the top of that strongly elitist and prejudiced mini-society that is the universe of teenagers. And she doesn't hesitate to use it to try to improve things around her.\r\n\r\nThis is the great movie of Alicia Silverstone's life. The actress still did some work later, and is known and respected, but the truth is that her career did not have such strong and relevant successes again. She embodied Cher in such a sincere and authentic way that it became difficult, from then on, to detach the character from the actress. Brittany Murphy also deserves a round of applause. She was incredibly young, but showed signs of talent and remained active as an actress until the end of her (unfortunately) brief life. Stacey Dash does what she can, but she doesn't have the time or material to shine like her peers. The film also has good performances by Dan Hedaya and Paul Rudd.\r\n\r\nThe movie doesn't have amazing visuals or great effects, nor is it supposed to. In fact, one of the secrets to its success (commercially, of course) was the fact that it had an average budget and a remarkable success at the box office. Without an unlimited credit card, the production went to great lengths to make the film look more expensive than it is, and I believe that a good part of the investment went into the elegant and seemingly expensive costumes for the three main characters, as well as the house where Cher lives, a magnificent California mansion.", "I remember growing up watching this movie. I liked it for probably different reasons then others like it. I liked it because I hated girls like her. So I thought she just looked ridiculous the whole movie which made it funny to me.

Premise is simple, genetic tampering by unstable farmer man-child type has produced psychotic zombie sheep who like to chow down on human flesh. If you are \"lucky\" to still be alive after being bitten, you turn into a human/sheep hybrid - who likes to chow down on human flesh! All inhabitants of this island are doomed unless three spunky young heroes in waiting can overcome monumental odds and save the day!\r\n\r\nWith effects done by Weta being no bad thing, Black Sheep is a whole bunch of popcorn munching fun. Many of the jokes aren't really surprising but they hit the mark because the comedy is drawn nice and broad. It helps as well that much of it carries a sense of mischievous depravity about it, while the snarky asides to scientists and tree hugging environmentalists shows King to have a semblance of world awareness about him. The cinematography (Richard Bluck) is gorgeous, capturing the magnificent landscapes as a backdrop to the ovine carnage, and Victoria Kelly's musical score is jovial supreme.\r\n\r\nNothing earth shattering here, so those horror/comedy fans who venture in for the first time expecting otherwise will be disappointed. However, at under 90 minutes in length King's movie never once sags in pace or gasp for new comedic air. It's a short sharp shocker of a rib tickler and well worthy of a look if in the requisite mood. 7/10"], ["Did we really need a secondhand retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale as seen through the eyes of the eponymous, non-canonical housemaid? This is such a well-known story that adding a fresh perspective may have seemed like a good idea at the time; on the other hand, what possible insight could Mary (Julia Roberts) offer when she\u2019s either blind as a bat or dumb as a rock?\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s not alone, though; everyone in this movie who isn\u2019t Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde suffers from Lois Lane Syndrome. The closest anyone ever comes to pointing out the uncanny resemblance between the \"master\" and his \"assistant\" is remarking that \"they do look a bit alike.\" More like a yottabit.\r\n\r\nJohn Malkovich could have been as good an Edward Hyde as we was a Vicomte Valmont, and that\u2019s precisely what made him wrong for the Henry Jekyll part. Casting him in both roles not only completely misses the original novel\u2019s Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy theme, but also makes the rest of the characters, especially the heroine, like complete morons. And since everyone in the audience knows, if they know nothing else, that Jekyll and Hyde are one and the same, what the hell was the point anyway?"], ["_**Real-life questions about love and infidelity**_\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1995 and directed by Clint Eastwood, \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County\u201d details what happens in 1965 when a world-traveling photographer for National Geographic (Eastwood) inadvertently meets an Iowa Farm wife (Meryl Streep). \r\n\r\nThis is a drama about the nature of eros love and potential infidelity that will only be appreciated by mature viewers. It consists of two people meeting, getting acquainted, discovering something profound and then forced to make decisions that\u2019ll determine the rest of their lives, as well as the consequences for those linked to them. \r\n\r\nSome questions addressed include: What if you\u2019re married and you meet someone you genuinely romantically love? What if you\u2019re single and you meet a married person you profoundly love? How far do you (or can you) wisely take the relationship? What about others who would be negatively affected by pursuing the relationship?\r\n\r\nThese are all honest questions that most people have to consider at one time or another in their lives. The movie\u2019s not corrupt for asking them or featuring a certain questionable act any more than the story of David & Bathsheba makes the Bible corrupt (or, arguably worse, the story of Judah & Tamar).\r\n\r\nOne character is too loose with morals, which he justifies by criticizing all the \u201cborders\u201d in life. But there are boundaries everywhere: National, state, county, city, school, government, business, social and\u2026 marital. The bottom line is: You\u2019re either married or you\u2019re not. If you\u2019re married that means you have a committed lifelong covenant with your spouse. That\u2019s what taking vows is all about. The movie tries to have its cake and eat it too by supporting such loyalty while flirting with the temptation to discard it in the name of true love. Regardless, the picture smacks of real life, real people, real (hard) decisions and is very well done, which is to be expected with Eastwood at the helm.    \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in Winterset & Adel, Iowa.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-", "A bit too cheesy for me to overly enjoy, but <em>'The Bridges of Madison County'</em> is a sweet romantic drama.\r\n\r\nClint Eastwood and Meryl Streep are a strong pairing and produce very good performances, with Streep particularly standing out... even if her acting Italian doesn't always feel convincing, to me anyway.

Unfortunately, when it comes to the film industry, the plot-link is kind of the most important one, so I can't really call Judge Dredd a success. And although the general premise is strong, this is not to the credit of the movie, seeing as it sources its material from the comic books of the same name, and 2000 AD.\r\n\r\nSylvester Stallone (the titular Dredd) and Rob Schneider (his offsider) are perhaps poor casting options. But they aren't so terrible as to make Judge Dredd unwatchable, especially seeing as there are a quite a few good choices to balance this out.\r\n\r\nDespite being made in '95, it shares that intrinsically 1980's vision of a dystopian future, where all the buildings are black, all the signs are neon, and all the residents are androgynous punks and goths. Which to be honest I'm a huge sucker for, so this earns Judge Dredd some points (though again, not for originality).\r\n\r\nIt's perhaps not the sort of description you'd expect of a violence-heavy, guilty-pleasure dodgy sci-fi, but Judge Dredd is just so cute! The ABC Warrior I have a particular soft spot for, but even overall, the piece is enjoyable to not take seriously (though taking it seriously is probably impossible).\r\n\r\nYes it's true that Judge Dredd is enjoyable in a laughing at it kind of way rather than a laughing with it one, but that's still enjoyable in my books.\r\n\r\n51%\r\n\r\n -Gimly", "I AM...

He goes down a treat and is soon in their store chatting to all the children. He has an honest streak - he tells the parents where they can shop more cheaply and that's risky for his job!

He isn't popular with everyone, however, and after a street altercation with his walking stick a his predecessor's head, he finds himself in court. He isn't charged with assault: they are trying to certify him for claiming to be - well, whom he cannot possibly be. Or can he? It's a wee bit long, this, but Sir Richard enters into the spirit of things enthusiastically. Though his accent isn't as reliable as it might be, he brings a certain mischief to the role. He is well supported by the increasingly incredulous prosecutor \"Collins\" (JT Walsh) and by Robert Prosky in the judge's chair. It's a pleasing story, well told, with some gentle humour that takes a swipe at the bah-humbug society that has long since forgotten what Christmas really ought to be about.

Doesn't mystery intrinsically come with the territory of space adventure?); plus the story is a bit convoluted, particularly for those not familiar with Star Trek up to this point, both generations.\r\n\r\nRegardless, \"Generations\" is ambitious, high-concept sci-fi of the highest order; it leaves the viewer with many interesting questions to ponder long afterwards. Although the Nexus has been criticized as a mere gimmick to get Kirk and Picard together, I find the concept utterly fascinating: No matter how much we want it, an illusory paradise is just that, an illusion. As far as I'm concerned, the concept of the Nexus and its implementation into the storyline is nothing short of brilliant. Who created the Nexus? Why, who else but the Talosians, the 'antagonists' of Trek's very first episode, \"The Cage\"! Think about it.\r\n\r\nBesides this, there are multiple highlights (some SPOILERS follow): The usual Trek humor, Data's amusing experiences with the emotion chip, Malcolm McDowell's outstanding performance as the Soran, his believable obsession and justifications, B'Etor & Lursa and their \"wild bunch\" Klingons, the startling obliteration of them and their vessel, the thrilling crash-landing of the Enterprise-D, the meeting of Kirk and Picard in the Nexus, the final showdown with Soran and Kirk's death. Needless to say, \"Generations\" does far more than offer mere juvenile space battles.\r\n\r\nBIGGEST PLOT HOLE (OR MAYBE NOT): Picard's purpose in leaving the Nexus is to stop Soran from annihilating the Enerprise-D crew and the entire Veridian solar system, including the 230 million people that live on Veridian IV. Since Picard can leave the Nexus and \"go anywhere any time,\" as Guinan pointed out earlier, why go to Veridian III about A MINUTE before Soran launches his rocket? Why not go back to when Soran was a guest on the Enterprise-D and apprehend him then and there? Writer Ronald D. Moore defended Picard's decision on the grounds that he didn't want to risk the dangerous and unexpected consequences that can occur when tampering with the timeline; hence, his journey back in time from the Nexus is only a matter of a minute or so. It's a good explanation.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of explanations, some have criticized the fact that Guinan is simultaneously present in the real world and in the Nexus. How could this be? It's simple: It is repeatedly established that the reality experienced in the Nexus is not real; one experiences what they desire in the Nexus, not what is necessarily real. For instance, Picard has no children in the real world, but because he DESIRED to have them he was able to experience them in the Nexus. Hence, the 'Guinan' portrayed in the Nexus may walk, talk and act precisely like Guinan, but she's not real. She's only there because Picard desires her to be there for the purpose of explaining the nature of the Nexus. That said, many of the people in the Nexus are real, like Picard and Kirk. \r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY ON THE NEXUS: Although the Nexus should simply be taken at face value as a strange space phenomenon (likely created by the Talosians), you can also regard it as an analogy. At first glance the viewer might get the impression that the Nexus is a type of heaven, but this can't be so since it is repeatedly emphasized in the film that the people and events experienced in the Nexus are NOT real (for the most part). 'Heaven,' a term theologians and ministers traditionally use to refer to the eternal abode of the redeemed (technically referred to as \"the new heavens and new earth\" in the bible, as shown in 2 Peter 3:13), is always depicted as real in the bible, not an illusory paradise. If the Nexus is not analogous of heaven, what could it be a type of? The Nexus corresponds to any addiction a person \"tastes\" and embraces to escape reality (e.g. pipe dreams, drugs, alcohol, computer games, TV, porn, fishing, shopping, golf, etc.). Some, like Soran, are unable to flee its clutches and waste their lives and talents OBSESSED by it. Others, like Picard and Kirk, are able to see the truth and escape; they therefore \"make a difference\" in real life.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: This \"passing-of-the-torch\" installment requires an attention span and an appreciation for high-concept sci-fi; it will likely bore those for whom Star Trek only means neato spacecrafts and superficial space dogfights (don't get me wrong, they each have their place in Trek). \"Generations\" has the courage to make bold changes -- killing off an iconic character, and fairly prominent support characters as well, not to mention destroying the Enterprise-D. In short, \"Generations\" is science-fiction for grown-ups and youth with advanced cerebral development. All others should stick with juvenile space fantasy flicks (giggle).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A", "I'll be honest, I really hated Star Trek The Motion Picture.

A transvestite is anyone who wears clothing belonging to the opposite sex to look like that. A transsexual is anyone who believes that they should have been born with the opposite sex to the one they have, and who, not infrequently, begins to undergo medical treatments in order to achieve the physical appearance they desire. What do they have in common? Both are minorities of little expression within the \u201cgay\u201d movement and, despite being visible, they have demands that sometimes contradict those of the homosexual movement, leading to some internal friction.\r\n\r\nNone of this really matters, but it helps to understand why the group keeps this film on their favorites list. Filmed in Australia, it shows us the bumpy journey of a troupe of transvestites through the Australian desert to a remote town, where they are supposed to have some shows. The film has an intelligent script, where the adventures and misadventures of the trio intersect with other caricatured characters and, of course, with the intolerance and homophobia of isolated rural communities, where the \u201cgay friendly\u201d film takes the opportunity to make certain criticisms of these attitudes. Unfortunately, the film doesn't give us more than this, the characters are poorly developed and the feeling that remains is that of a project made to please a niche audience and not to tell a good story.\r\n\r\nThe cast has three strong names at the front who ensure consistent protagonism: Terence Stamp, Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce. The three actors are solid bets and do a very decent job with the material received, with Pearce, more extravagant and bizarre, being the one who least satisfies me. The character he offered us is a caricature and not a credible human figure. He is the one who purchases the tourist bus that will be used on the trip, and which he bizarrely names Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film does not present great quality scores, for which it deserves special praise. With a couple of exceptions: the first is the design of the costumes worn in the film by the trio of main actors, full of bizarre details that allude to the world of the show; The second is the cinematography, very well conceived and crafted, and to which the exquisite choice of desert filming locations and, also, the good filming and lighting work largely contributed.", "Drag queen \"Tick\" (Hugo Weaving) gets the offer of a gig in Alice Springs and suggests to fellow artiste \"Bernadette\" (Terence Stamp) that they both go.

Next thing, the three have an old (soon to be pink) bus and are winging their way from Sydney at the start of their 1700 mile trip north. Like any trip in a confined space, tempers flare and these three, already near the top of the histrionics chart, provide us with some entertainingly profane language that make you smile and wince at the same time. As they travel, they tentatively explore more of each other's foibles and personalities as well as a terrain which isn't always the most hospitable. En route, they encounter \"Bob\" (Bill Hunter) who might just offer an hint of romance for the trans \"Bernadette\" who is suffering from a bit of ennui with life in general. Their eventual arrival tops a journey of discovery for all of them, but especially \"Tick\" who's in for quite a surprise! A great soundtrack and some earthy and witty writing help out enormously here, but it's essentially the three men whose ridiculously exaggerated characterisations and temper tantrums of an existence that make this a journey you'd love to watch but are very glad you're not actually on. There were a few popular films made that challenged the global stereotype of Australian machismo and bull-headedness but by taking this into the outback, this offers everyone a chance to contrast the open-mindedness of some with the opposite in others - all whilst keeping sight of the fact that this is a comedy, and a satirical and delightfully sarcastic one at that."], ["_**The animated show comes to life with John Goodman in the lead role**_\r\n\r\nWhile critics love to bash this live-action cinematic version of \"The Flintstones\" and the rating here at IMDb is surprisingly low, the movie was a huge hit in 1994 and fittingly so because this is a great movie for what it is. Speaking of which, this explains why \"The Flintstones\" is such easy prey to incessant panning \u2013 it's a movie based on a cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, does it work for what it is and the answer is a resounding \"yes\"! Movies should be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve. For instance, \"Godzilla\" is a colossal-creature movie and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original \"Apocalypse Now\" it's dreck, but how does it stack-up to other gigantic-monster movies? It's the same thing with \"The Flintstones.\" \r\n\r\nRoger Ebert criticized the film on the grounds that \"the story is confusing, not very funny, and kind of odd, given the target audience of younger children and their families. Do kids really care much about office politics, embezzlement, marital problems, difficulties with adoption, aptitude exams and mothers-in-law?\" For one thing, the film IS funny if you're familiar with The Flintstones and, more so, if you're a fan, which I am. I've seen the movie four times now and, without exception, laughed from beginning to end. Now the laughs may be more giggling at silly humor than uproarious laughter, but laughing nonetheless. \r\n\r\nAs for the criticism that the story's confusing and misses the supposed target audience because of adult-oriented elements, this just shows that the \"target audience\" wasn't just kids. \"The Flintstones\" is for kids AND adults equally, which was true of the original cartoon as well, but more so with the movie, and I'm glad. The live-action version of \"Dudley Do-Right\" (1999) made the mistake of aiming solely for kids \u2013 real little kids -- and it seriously bombed and justifiably so because it's a complete dud. It's impossible to watch that movie as an adult and stay interested. \"The Flintstones\" doesn't make this mistake and that's why it was such a hit and remains thoroughly entertaining to this day.\r\n\r\nThe cast is great, even Rosie O'Donnell as Betty (who I didn't think would work), but John Goodman as Fred is so good it's like the cartoon come to life! Furthermore, the sets and F/X are top-of-the line and surprisingly hold up to this day. In addition, the story has warmth and offers realistic and worthy themes. Take, for instance, Fred and Barney's bond. They're best friends and their personalities balance each other out. You'll see this in real life. My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that \"The Flintstones\" is entertaining from beginning to end for all the reasons noted above and it wisely doesn't overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Sun Valley, California, and Snow Canyon State Park, Utah.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A"], ["Given the huge success of the first two, I suppose the trilogy was bound to happen - but by now the joke and the characterisations had really worn very thin indeed. \"Drebin\" (Leslie Nielsen) is now happily (?) retired and living with his long-suffering wife \"Jane\" (Priscilla Presley) when he is sought out by his erstwhile colleagues \"Ed\" (George Kennedy) and \"Nordberg\" (OJ Simpson) to help out on their most dangerous case yet. Nope, the Queen is not making another state visit - it's \"Rocco\" (Fred Ward) and it looks like he wants to save Chris Rock any future embarrassment by blowing up the Oscars ceremony. What now ensues is a by now routine sequence of frying pan to fire scenarios, straight out of a Laurel & Hardy film. Sadly, that humour is all a bit pass\u00e9 now and though an appearance by Anna Nicole Smith must have given every budding actress from Tallahassee to Timbuktu a sense of hope that if she can make it, they can - the rest of it falls pretty flat! It is well enough made, the quips are quickly delivered and some of them still raise the odd smile. In the main, though, it is 80 minutes that almost looks like out-takes from the first two films with a thinly constructed plot by way of a template to hold it all together. It is watchable, but just not a patch on the earlier iterations.", "**A fitting end to one of the great comedy trilogies of the 90s.**\r\n\r\nThis is the third and final film in the \u201cNaked Gun\u201d trilogy. Throughout the film, one can smell farewell and conclusion, and it is undeniable that, among them, this is the weakest and least interesting. Even so, the film does what it needs to do to please its audience, who already know perfectly well what they are going to see and have a certain level of expectations. Although his style of humor may displease many people, we cannot deny that the three films were a notable success in the 80s and 90s, and that they had a major impact on Leslie Nielsen's filmography.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the strength of Nielsen's work and charisma is what makes the film work. Without him, or with another actor, nothing would make sense and the final product would have no value. Even so, we must also highlight the work developed by O. J. Simpson, Priscilla Presley and George Kennedy, actors who put a lot of effort into their respective roles and found, in this film, time and material to match their talent. In fact, compared to its predecessors \u2013 and in these cases comparisons are inevitable \u2013 I thought this film gave more space to the secondary actors and gained additional quality as a result.\r\n\r\nIt's not worth talking too much about the technical aspects, as this is a comical film that invests little in them and puts all its chips on humor and the main actor's performance. Even so, we can say that the film manages to maintain the quality that the trilogy has accustomed the public to. The script continues to be a problem, however, and is seen only as a vehicle for successive comic sequences and slapstick humor routines.", "<em>'Naked Gun 33\u2153: The Final Insult'</em> is the weakest of the trilogy, though fair amusement is still produced.\r\n\r\nLeslie Nielsen is so good in the lead role that I don't think it's really possible for these films to drag, at least alongside the decent gags and short run time. Admittedly this third entry does meander a tad, though my interest in events never waned into negative territory. The ending is the strongest part, that facepalm scene (which I knew of before) is gold.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a good franchise. I'm quite looking forward to hopefully checking out Liam Neeson in the 2025 remake, as long as the writing is suitable I think he can absolutely make it work."], ["I seem to like **True Lies** a significant amount less than most people do. And it's not because it isn't my type of movie either, Schwarzeneggar as a secret agent in an explosive 90s action movie is absolutely my jam.

Away from the family home he's a top spy for one of America's highest secret services. When Harry is prompted to believe that Helen is having an affair, it signals the start of a sequence of events that will out Harry and lead them both to a confrontation with a deadly terrorist. \r\n\r\nTo hell with misogyny and stereotypical Arab terrorist (Art Malik so OTT he's off the chain man), Cameron's True Lies really isn't concerned for political correctness. His aim, aided by his on form cast, is to chase, caress and explode stuff whilst having a laugh at every turn. True Lies, if anyone was in doubt prior to its release, shows Cameron to be supremely gifted at action set pieces. No expense spared of course, but you still gotta utilise those Harrier Jets, helicopters and horse carrying elevators to great effect. And so it proves. Throw in a tremendously funny script that gives Tom Arnold & Bill Paxton comedy gold roles to revel in; and what you get is a Worldwide box office profit of nearly $264 million. \r\n\r\nIt knows it's nonsense, but it's the good kind of nonsense that Hollywood has to offer. Ever re-watchable, True Lies is undeniably great fun. 7.5/10", "The zenith of Arnold's career... \"True Lies\" not only represents the singular moment in the actor's pre-governor acting career where he played more than a one dimensional action hero. In an homage to the secret agent genre, the film opens with an action / glamour set-piece that is more James Bond than a 21st century 007 film.  From there the story breaks into what would a few years later become the mold for numerous of Jackie Chan's \"goofy secret agent\" movies, although Chan would replace the cutting-edge CGI special effects set-pieces with a variety of more economical but just-as-exciting acrobatic, complex choreography hand-to-hand fights.  There is one mano-a-mano beat down scene where Arnold takes down his enemy by flushing his head in a urinal, complete with his attempt at a trade-mark one-liner: \"Cool Off\".  (It's a set piece worth comparing to the more recent scene in \"Mission Impossible: Fallout\".)  Along with that, it shifts smoothly back and forth from a rather straightforward super-spy/terrorist story line and exploring the practical troubles of living of the life of a secret agent while having a wife and kids.  This film also represents the movie that put Jamie Lee Curtis back on the map after a stint in a slew of flops following her role in \"A Fish Called Wanda\".  \"True Lies\" put her acting range on display and put to rest any lingering question of whether she was anything more than a scream queen.  One of the most hilarious moments she pulls off flawlessly is falling flat on her face while attempting to pole dance, and then getting getting back up and acting like it didn't happen.  Without her screen presence, the film would be just another entry in the list of Arnold action films scotched with a twist of comedy.  One could go so far as to conclude that the difference in the enduring appeal of \"True Lies\" vs. the mis-matched partner straight-man, funny-man film \"Red Heat\" is the degree to which Jamie Lee Curtis caries the fish-out-of-water funny-woman role in contrast to Jim Belushi's semi-funny, street-wise American cop. But, unlike the cold war, the regimented soviet style vs. the fast-and-lost American way, the contrast in \"True Lies\" derives from the ahead-of-it's time idea of adaptable, underrated woman and her somewhat over-inflated male counterpart.  When the secret agents attempt to arrest Curtis's character, she fights back fiercely, with a well placed nut-shot that made women and men alike erupt with cheers and laughter in theaters, something not so likely contemporary Hollywood's constant browbeating with girl power - male buffoonery film after film."], ["Almost thirty years after their first on screen appearance, and more than **fifty** after their creation, The Addams Family proved itself still relevant in the 1990s. _Addams Family Values_ specifically though, might be my favourite part of the whole franchise.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it.

Speaking of interlopers, it's also clear that nanny has quite a malevolent streak of her own - and \"Fester\" might soon be destined to join her long list of deceased spouses. As ever, it's Huston who steals the show here - she barely features, but when she does she imbues the whole thing with a certain menacing dignity. The rest of the ensemble work well together and the story is peppered with plenty of daft (adult) humour, a little bit of gentle slapstick and \"Lurch\" (Carer Struycken) is there to keep order.

Still, can't say I hated it and was a passable time-waster. **2.5/5**", "This is now ten years after the original and is a very poor relation. Gone are the established cast and therefore most of the chemistry as Eddie Murphy reprises his role as loud-mouthed cop \"Axel Foley\" just once too often. It has many of the ingredients that made this franchise successful, but somehow the seriously B-list supporting cast and the repetitive nature of the action scenes just don't really work nearly so well. \"Foley\" has the odd quip to deliver, but even Murphy seems to be going through the motions as his character gets drawn into a counterfeiting ring being run out of an LA theme park. That latter scenario gives ample opportunity for some lame gags and the dialogue here is much more aggressive. Anglo-Saxon creeps in where before we had wit; the film is courser, less polished and - as usual, to be fair - there is no jeopardy at all about the eventual ending. Someone doubtless made a pile of cash from this derivate effort, so hopefully we can stop now before the tarnish really sets in."], [], [], ["Having just watched this for the first time in 2018, I wonder if Arnold Schwarzenegger had intended for this to be a sort of retirement movie.

That said, it's ground-breaking cinema that illustrates just what a dad will do to to be with his children and it takes a huge great swipe at sexual stereotyping too.

A serial killer returns after a two-year absence and bodies of beautiful women start turning up in the river, all women whom Hardy used to date! Sarah Jessica Parker is on hand as Hardy's partner on the river, Jo Christman.\r\n\r\nThe movie has a bad reputation. Roger Ebert tore it to pieces, basically saying it was too derivative and by-the-numbers, and Willis himself said he hated it. I can understand criticism to a point. The story has a melodramatic comic-book vibe, which is obvious in the opening act, almost like a TV production except with a superior cast and action scenes. But, and this is an important \u201cbut,\u201d I found myself drawn into the story & the characters and greatly enjoyed the rare Pittsburgh locations, as well as the (melo)drama and thrills. In other words, the movie is entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.\r\n\r\nThis is a cop thriller in the manner of the Dirty Harry series, especially \u201cThe Dead Pool\u201d (1988), except it\u2019s more comic booky and taking place in Pittsburgh rather than San Francisco. It's also reminiscent of films like \"The General's Daughter\" (1999). Although not technically as good as the Dirty Harry movies or \"The General's Daughter\" due to its cartoonish-ness, \"Striking Distance\" nevertheless pulled me into the lives of the characters and, for the most part, furnished the requisite thrills.\r\n\r\nThe generically-named movie (also akin to the Dirty Harry franchise) was originally called \"Three Rivers,\u201d a much better title simply because it's more specific, but was changed at the last minute because the marketing department feared people would think it was a sports movie due to Three Rivers Stadium, so they switched it to \"Striking Distance.\" Why \u201cStriking Distance\u201d? The first hint is at the beginning of the movie when the title card shows two electrical bolts coming out from either side of the title. Later we observe the mysterious killer using a stun gun before killing his victims and, with a stun gun, you must of course be within... striking distance!\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the killer, one element of the plot I haven't mentioned is that this is a whodunit. Someone is charged with being the killer early on but Hardy knows it's the wrong guy; he and others are sure it's a cop or ex-cop doing the killings. There are a few suspects, including Hardy himself, but I honestly was unable to guess the right person. There's another twist late in the story that also took me by surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Striking Distance\" may not be exceptional and is marred by cartoonish exaggeration, but it entertains as a cop thriller and that's what's most important when it comes to these types of flicks. Plus it was shot in Pittsburgh, a refreshing change.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 42 minutes. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Martin Kaplan.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-"], ["_The Super Mario Bros.

The screenplay is admittedly very bare bones, and the characters lack depth, but the film still manages to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise. The writers do not attempt to do anything beyond create a narrative that intentionally puts our characters in worlds and areas that are instantly recognizable to the audience. This makes the film feel like a Mario game come to life so that audiences can say \u201cthat is like Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros.\u201d The movie pacing flies at a breakneck speed, and I felt that this movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the story and characters a bit more.\r\n\r\nI was initially nervous about how the voice acting would hold up, but I was pleasantly surprised. Chris Pratt's voice as Mario is not over the top, which works well. It would have been extremely annoying to hear the super Italian Mario accent for a full hour and thirty minutes. Jack Black's portrayal of Bowser steals the show and was the best of the film. Anna Taylor Joy and Seth Rogan were good as Princess Peach and Donkey Kong, although I think Rogan may have injected a bit too much of himself in the character.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the film is solid, with great action set pieces and creative camera angles that make the action feel exciting and dynamic. The animation is stunning, with the characters and world directly designed off the games, but with more polish and details than ever before. The lighting is beautiful, with the bright lights of Rainbow Road and the dark, fiery flames of Bowser standing out as highlights.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie may not be the deepest or most complex film, but it is a good time for fans of the Mario franchise. The movie captures the fun and whimsy tone of the games and brings it to life on the big screen. While the comedy may not hit every mark, the voice acting, and direction make up for it.

Tony Goldwyn plays his business partner while Whoopi Goldberg is on hand as a psychic spiritual advisor.   \r\n\r\nLike all great movies, \u201cGhost\u201d (1990) takes about 15-20 minutes to establish the characters and then takes off, gripping the viewer until the end. It combines drama, thrills and comedy in its fascinating exploration of the hereafter and is cut from the same cloth as future movies \u201cCity of Angels\u201d (1998), \u201cMeet Joe Black\u201d (1998) and \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d (1999).\r\n\r\nWhile the film\u2019s theology is no deeper than a Jack T.

As it was, the film went down a treat for the modern cinema going audience, it raked in cash galore and spawned a raft of very inferior sequels, even though ultimately critics of the time were less than impressed.\r\n\r\nSo it makes for something of an interesting experience viewing it again as each decade passes. More so in light of Christopher Nolan's bank busting \"Dark Knight\" series of films. I remember the hype and marketing campaign (T-Shirts and toys bonanza) that ensured that the film could never live up to the gargantuan hype, and I'm honest enough to say that I was a little underwhelmed on first viewing. Yet time has been very kind to it, now showing that Burton had the nous and foresight to reignite a genre without going purely for kiddie like appeasements. \r\n\r\nVisually the film still stands up with the best that today's genre pieces can offer, the sets are incredible, with Anton Furst rightly winning the big award for his work here, whilst Burton's dark and deep tone captures the essence of Gotham City and Bruce Wayne's troubled mind perfectly, but does the cast fully realise the potential on offer?. Michael Keaton as the troubled and vengeful Bruce Wayne, is a fine actor and it would only be in time where his take on Wayne the man would be appreciated, as the caped crusader he is outstanding and he set the bar high for all those that followed him.  \r\n\r\nJack Nicholson has the time of his life camping it up as The Joker, and he steals the film for sure. This is not because he is acting with great poise and class, but purely because in a film calling for the battle of two unhinged characters, he is the one awash in colour and overacting the maniacal side of the character to the max. Kim Basinger looks great but doesn't have to do much as Vicki Vale except say her lines right, pout, look scared when required and scream with conviction, and she does all of these. But really any other actress could have done the same thing - though I'm personally relieved that Sean Young dropped out of the film and thus allowed some other actress to step in. \r\n\r\nThe supporting cast do OK, and the soundtrack by Prince pushes the boundaries of annoying caricature indulgence. Ultimately it's a fun ride, respectful of the source material and giving the comic book genre of fil a shot in the arm. Yet you can't help feeling that there is some great Burton vision here that never got fully realised. And that is a damn shame, and something that Burton himself would come to admit down the line. 8/10", "This movie is so bad I couldn't even finish it.", "Yeah, it's good.", "_**Looks good, but surreal and tedious**_\r\n\r\nTim Burton's \"Batman\" (1989) is _so_ disappointing! Yeah, the costumes, sets, cast, cinematography and music are great, but the story is unrealistic, goofy and, worst of all, dull; in other words, it siphoned! Tim Burton is outstanding with visuals, but he failed to incorporate an interesting story. What good is a BORING film that looks great and doesn't take its subject seriously? This is a quintessential example of style over substance.\r\n\r\nMost of the high ratings are from people who saw it when they were kids and they're just nostalgic. If they viewed the film objectively as an adult, with respect to the true Batman of the silver/bronze/modern age of comics, they'd have to admit that it's not a good interpretation.\r\n\r\nSure, it could be accepted as a sort of an ALTERNATIVE Batman; a friend of mine who's in the comic business said this was the only way he could appreciate it. But if you want to see a serious Batman flick, true to the legend of the Dark Knight, catch \"Batman Begins\" (2005) and its sequels, they blow this overrated soporific dud out of the water.\r\n\r\nThe movie's overlong at 2 hours, 6 minutes. \r\n\r\nGRADE: C", "**Batman 1989 burst on the scene shattering the box office and rewriting the rules of comic book films with dark characters and high stakes in ways no superhero movie had seen before.**\r\n\r\nSuperhero movies of the 70s and 80s were bright and colorful, goofy and optimistic, champions of truth, Justice, and the American Way. Movies like Superman, Supergirl, the original Captain America, and even Adam West\u2019s Batman all fit this vibe and aesthetic, with many overly campy but charming. This made Tim Burton\u2019s darker, more violent Batman a huge gamble. Warner Bros literally sank every last penny they had into the movie as the studio was collapsing and going out of business. A dark superhero film with murder and blood? Michael Keaton? Mr. Mom himself as Batman? It was a massive risk with a tremendous payoff! Warner Bros survived and thrived off the enormous box office profits, and Batman reinvented the superhero genre showing that adults could enjoy superhero movies too. Even though Batman 1989 is a little dated and campy now, it broke every mold when it was released. Michael Keaton proved himself as the incredible star and bankable actor that he is. Jack Nicholson\u2019s Joker stood as the iconic standard for villains for decades. Kim Basinger\u2019s Vicki Vale is still one of the best Batman love interests to date.

The vision of the world is brilliant. Keaton's Batman is spot on and the Prince soundtrack ties the whole thing together perfectly.

Although Ben Affleck's jaded, grumpy and bulked-out depiction of the character in Batman V Superman is my favourite.", "\"Batman\" never was my favourite superhero, and although Michael Keaton tries hard here to inject a little soul into the character, I'm afraid I found Jack Nicholson's totally over-the-top \"Joker\" to be just annoying and the whole film to be little underwhelming. \"Gotham City\" is essentially an urban jungle under the boot of the menacing \"Grissom\" (Jack Palance). He and his sidekick \"Napier\" (Nicholson) - who only has a limited grasp on his sanity - have a bit of a falling out, though, and the latter man is soon swimming in a vat of deadly chemicals... The result? Well his madness is now completely unleashed on his former boss then on the entire city as he attempts to gain complete control. Luckily for DA \"Harvey Dent\" (Billy Dee Williams) and Police Commissioner \"Gordon\" (Pat Hingle) the city might just have a chance of salvation in the form of our eponymous, black leather-caped, crusader. Equipped with a bullet-proof car, a super-charged motor bike and some heavy duty kevlar body armour he vows to take on the criminal element and restore some sort of order. He, too, has his demons - which we learn about as the story develops, and it seems they can only be tempered by his loyal retainer \"Alfred\" (Michael Gough). As the stakes rise, it soon becomes a man-to-man combat scenario that I found all rather too theatrical. The visual effects are solid, the audio and lighting also work well to create an at times intimidating atmosphere, but I just found myself missing the point. There can be no doubt that Nicholson's performance as an actor is outstanding, but for me it created a relentless, almost pantomime-style, character that as it persisted just rather left me looking around the cinema wondering what Burt Ward was doing nowadays. Groundbreaking it was in 1989. In 2023 - well I'm not at all sure.

Needless to say, nothing goes to plan and he embarks on a series of adventures that put him, \"Jiminy\" and his father in considerable peril. This is a much more complex storyline than you might expect; there is plenty of joy and fun, but also a darkness that provides food for thought for children and parents alike. The wonderful, Oscar winning, score is the best in the Disney repertoire and the characterisations are engaging. If it has any flaws: the dialogue - there is too much of it; it is possibly just a little too long and finally - I just didn't really like \"Pinocchio\" much as a little boy - a bit too thoughtless and selfish.

My main gripe with the movie was (and is) that it did not feel like a Mission Impossible movie.\r\n\r\nSpoilers ahead! In the original series the team always succeeded, at least in the episodes I watched. However, the movie starts off with a big failure. Then to make matters worse we learn that Mr. Phelps, one of the original lead characters, is actually a traitor. I was so disappointed!\r\n\r\nNow when I watched it for the second time with my son I actually liked it a lot more. I still think it is sad that the script writers felt they had to introduce all these chock elements but trying to look past those this is a pretty good movie. I still do not think it is truly a Mission Impossible movie in the good old style of the series though.\r\n\r\nIt is a very good action/thriller movie though. Tom Cruise is really not bad in the role of Ethan Hunt and so are the rest of the actors. He is performing quite a few spectacular stunts and there are a decent amount of high tech stuff in the movie. Sure, some of the stunts and action scenes are perhaps a bit convoluted but it provides for some good cinemagic and it is fiction after all.\r\n\r\nIf this movie would not have been labelled Mission Impossible I would probably have given it another star but I cannot bring myself to completely overlook how far from the original inspiration it has strayed.", "_**Well done spy/caper thriller with Tom Cruise and an eye-rolling Scooby-Doo element**_\r\n\r\nThe Impossible Missions Force has a mission at a Prague gala concerning a CIA non-official cover list, but it doesn\u2019t go as planned.

The first entry in the Mission: Impossible film franchise blends spy thriller, murder mystery, and heist movie into one heart-pounding and compelling film. Paranoia runs rampant as agent Ethan Hunt is betrayed time and time again while trying to uncover who murdered his fellow agents and prevent the murder of many more.

What ensues is a fast-paced, well constructed movie that moves along cohesively with plenty going on - loads of tension, suspicion, nobody knowing whom to trust coupled with plenty of exciting stunts and a classy performance from Vanessa Redgrave bringing some gravitas to the proceedings as the stylish, but ruthless, \"Max\". Sure, it relies on tech and CGI a lot of the time, but the ensemble - Ving Rhames, Emmanuelle B\u00e9art and Jon Voight all deliver well into a plot that keeps us guessing until well into the denouement.

Billy (Robert John Burke) is a highly successful defense attorney, getting an acquittal for known mobster Richie (Joe Mantegna). He is trying to diet, topping the scales at three hundred pounds. One night while driving home, Heidi (Lucinda Jenney), Billy's wife, begins fooling around in the car with him while he is driving. In the throes of passion, Billy does not see an elderly gypsy woman crossing the street, runs over her, and kills her. The judge and police chief conspire to cover the crime up, and the death is ruled accidental. That does not sit well with the old woman's even older father, Lempke (Michael Constantine), who brushes Billy's cheek and whispers the title of the film. Soon, Billy is dropping three or four pounds a day. He seems to be disappearing before everyone's eyes, but concern sets in. He is eating twelve thousand calories a day, still losing weight, and now Heidi and his doctor (Sam Freed) are spending a little too much time together. Billy decides to track down the gypsies, especially after hearing and witnessing others in on the conspiracy were cursed as well, and he mistakenly enlists Richie to help him.\r\n\r\nGreg Cannom's special effects make-up is phenomenal. He has won Oscars in the past, and he should have won again for this film. Burke is totally believable going from 300 to 124 pounds in the span of the story. It helps that Burke's performance is as flawless as his make-up. He does not let all that latex and rubber get in the way, and goes from sympathetic to slightly deranged rather well. Jenney is also good as Heidi, although her character is often relegated to the \"supportive wife\" routine. The first hour of the film is very suspenseful. Billy is chasing the gypsies, and the authorities are chasing him. However, the film's biggest flaw was also the novel's biggest flaw- letting the convenient mob friend Richie help get revenge on the gypsies. Mantegna is one of those great actors who never receives his just credit, but here his character is just a caricature of mob types Mantegna has played before especially on \"The Simpsons\"- try listening to Mantegna and not hearing Fat Tony. Holland's direction keeps things fresh, he shockingly shot this on location in Maine instead of fleeing to Canada like most Hollywood films, but the screenplay feels rushed most of the time. I wonder if this would have made a more effective transition to mini-series form, something King has done before. I was surprised by \"Thinner.\"  Considering what some film makers have done to King's work, it is a better adaptation when put in that context. Strongly anchored by believable make-up and gore effects, and a fantastic central performance, I recommend it."], ["I think Leslie Nielsen ought to have re-considered his involvement with this really cringe-making comedy. His \"Agent Dick\" and \"WD40\" monikers are the stuff of \"Carry On\" films, and the rest of the humour and dialogue is almost as childish.

Nicolette Sheridan (\"Ukrinsky\") does her best as his Russian counterpart as they both seek out a not-so-ruthless \"Rancor\" (Andy Griffith) who, of course, wants to take over the world - but the ensuing escapades border all to often on the ridiculously slapstick. The juice has already been well and truly squeezed from the \"Drebin\" style of hapless character with the daft expressions and double-entendre ridden lines; and this film seems to go on for far longer than the eighty minutes running time.

The problem is that Jack grows at four times the normal rate and so when he finally is allowed to enter 5th grade at the age of 10 he looks like a 40 year-old man. Diane Lane plays his mother, Bill Cosby his tutor, Jennifer Lopez his teacher and Fran Drescher a single mother who\u2019s attracted to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cJack\u201d (1996) takes the basic topic of \u201cBig\u201d (1988) and mixes it with the awkwardness of \u201cMilk Money\u201d (1994). It tries to be a serious drama, a slapstick comedy and a profound tragedy, which is tonally bewildering. Nevertheless, it would\u2019ve been more successful if they worked out the kinks in the slapstick scenes, especially the ones with the kids, like the treehouse sequences. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the cast or the filmmaking except that the script needed improved to flesh out the potential. As it is, I had a hard time buying that Robin Williams was a 10 year-old boy and the comedic scenes with the kids didn\u2019t work for me, although they\u2019re passably amusing.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there are several things that make the movie worthwhile: Lopez, Drescher and Lane are thoroughly attractive and I especially enjoyed the scenes with Lopez and Drescher, like the bar sequence; Cosby is his likable self (before his fall from grace); and the second half is better than the unsure first half.\r\n\r\nDirector Francis Ford Coppola proved that he could effectively do this kind of whimsical fare with \u201cPeggy Sue Got Married\u201d (1986), but here he needed a better script. Still, some people love this movie (while critics like Siskel & Ebert tore it to pieces), so I suppose it\u2019s a matter of taste. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 53 minutes, and was shot in areas just north of Oakland/San Francisco (Vallejo, Mill Valley & Ross).\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+"], ["_**Farrelly brothers bowling comedy with Harrelson, Quade, Vanessa Angel and Murray**_ \r\n\r\nA former professional-class bowler (Woody Harrelson) discovers a childlike Amish prodigy in Pennsylvania (Randy Quade).

The story is quite simple and follows the journey of a clumsy university chemistry professor who, suffering from morbid obesity, decides to invent a serum that allows him, instantly, to assume the physical elegance he always dreamed of having... but when he falls in love with a slender woman, decides to test it on himself and discovers a disturbing side effect: a split personality that threatens to banish the real one and take on a life of its own.\r\n\r\nI called him a double personality, but it would be more accurate to call him an \u201calter ego\u201d, because Buddy Love \u2013 that's his name \u2013 is actually the reflection of all the repressed desires that Professor Sherman had and that he never fulfilled: a handsome, seductive, bold and flirtatious man, spontaneous and extroverted to the point of not having any kind of shame and having deeply unpleasant attitudes towards other people. Freudian? It's really something that only a psychoanalyst could understand, but which the film plays with in a deeply effective way.\r\n\r\nBut not everything is good in this film. The dialogues are quite weak, and the jokes were made with such a low and dirty style of humor that a person like me can hardly laugh. There are several moments in which this is observed more clearly, but all the scenes where the Klump family appears deserve negative attention. It's a part of the film that I, honestly, would have cut and deleted, and that I would never let a son or daughter see before we had a serious conversation about it.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is not a show in any way, except for all the makeup and costume work, developed around Eddie Murphy and the various characters he played in the film. It is a truly remarkable work, in which Murphy ages, rejuvenates, gains weight and loses weight as necessary, and always with a lot of verisimilitude and authenticity. And what about the work of the protagonist himself? I think it's enough to say that he deserves all the praise and accolades he received for the film. Despite the weaknesses and all the defects that I have pointed out, the commitment, dedication, professionalism and talent of an actor who, in a single film, plays eight or nine different characters is undeniable! If there's anything that makes this movie work, it's Eddie Murphy. Jada Pinkett Smith (still single at the time, as far as I know) did a decent job as a beauty who serves as Murphy's love interest, and does a reasonable job with her colleague, without being able to keep up with him for a single minute.

Yet these movies are never meanspirited; there\u2019s a welcome warmheartedness.\r\n\r\nThe cast & guest stars are great, including the villain played by Tim Matheson. Christine Taylor stands out as Marcia, although it's impossible to ever outdo the awesome Maureen McCormick. Jennifer Elise Cox also stands out as Jan, as does Gary Cole as Mike Brady. Shelley Long is effective as Carol Brady burdened by that absurd hairdo.\r\n\r\nI'm giving this a fairly high grade because it's funny and entertaining from beginning to end. The funniest subplot is the sudden infatuation between Greg and Marcia (after it dawns on them that they're not REALLY brother and sister) while one of the best sequences is the public pool scene, embellished by black versions of Jan, Marcia & Cindy.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Santa Monica & Los Angeles, CA, and Hawaii.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"], ["**_Over-the-top black comedy/horror with Dennis Miller_**\r\n\r\nA devout woman (Erika Eleniak) hires a droll private investigator (Dennis Miller) to find her little brother (Corey Feldman) after he mysteriously goes missing.

It also lacks the ambition and class of \u201cFrom Dusk\u201d with its focus on R-rated female nudity and sleaze, which is thankfully counterbalanced by Eleniak\u2019s winsome heroine and Dennis\u2019 likable gruff protagonist.

As noted, I think they were going for something way more amusing, especially with Theodore (Don Knotts) and Amos (Tim Conway) - who I liked watching, but they aren't overly funny.\r\n\r\nBill Bixby (Donovan) and Susan Clark (Dusty) team up to strong effect, while Harry Morgan probably gives the best performance as McCoy.

Starring Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Lindsay Lohan and Elaine Hendrix. The film begins with Nicholas Parker (Quaid) and Elizabeth James (Richardson) meeting on the Queen Elizabeth II. The two fall in love and decide to become husband and wife, and we are treated to a beautifully choreographed wedding ceremony. The movie skips to 11 years later, the couple has divorced and has full custody of each of their daughters, Hallie and Annie. The girls then meet up at a summer camp and engage in a rivalry. However when one pranks goes too far they must share a cabin together.\r\n\r\nThough initially at each other's throats the girls learn to bond and get along. Discovering they share the same birthday and only have one parent and one photograph of their respective parents, the girls discovered that their half-pictures make a complete picture. The girls then realize that they are twins, and devise a plan to reunite their parents. Through coaching and hair trimming Hallie and Annie take each other's places. Hallie goes to London under the guise of Annie James, and is taken home where she meets her mother for the very first time. Annie under the guise of Hallie goes back to Napa and is thrilled to see her father for the first time.\r\n\r\nHallie and Elizabeth bond when she is asked to go to work and help out a client with her wedding attire. Annie and Nick arrive home and Annie is shocked to find that her father is seeing another woman (Hendrix). Chessy (Lisa Ann Walters), Nick's nanny is very distrustful of her and assumes she is a gold digger. Nick formally introduces her as Meredith Blake, and Annie is forced to meet her and tells Meredith that Nick has a system for meeting new women. Annie then decides to call Hallie and alert her that their father is in love, despite her pleas to bring Elizabeth to America Hallie refuses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Chessy is suspicious of Annie who is opposite Hallie: neat as a pin, has a small appetite and notices that Hallie's dog is acting strange around Annie. Annie desperately tries to sabotage Nick and Meredith's unexpected engagement. While Elizabeth, Martin and Grandfather are suspicious of Hallie when her mannerisms are not like Annie's. Desperate, Annie calls Hallie and insists that if they want their parents to remarry they have to bring Elizabeth to America and sabotage the engagement together. Hallie then realizes that it is time to come clean, and tells Elizabeth the truth.\r\n\r\nElizabeth then decides to fly to America, but hesitant and stressed insists that Martin chaperone her. Annie arranges for Elizabeth, Hallie and Martin to meet Nick and Meredith's parents at the Stafford Hotel. The plan works but Elizabeth is furious to learn that the girls are plotting to reunite her with Nick. Unfortunately, Meredith learns that the girls are twins and that Nick and Elizabeth were married. The girls then decide to recreate their parents' first date, but it does not phase either Nick or Elizabeth. One last ditch effort is to convince Elizabeth to go with Nick and Hallie on an annual camping trip.\r\n\r\nElizabeth through means of trickery makes Meredith go in her place. After a series of pranks such as rocks in her sack, a lizard in her hair and pushing her air mattress into the water Meredith snaps. She then insists that Nick make a decision his daughters or his fiancee. Nick realizes that Meredith is a gold digger and a shrew and coldly breaks up with her by choosing Hallie and Annie. Elizabeth shocked to discover Meredith has broken up with Nick, reveals that Martin and Chessy have started a relationship. Nick decides to show Elizabeth his vintage wine collection and tells her that he now owns the rights to the wine they drank at their wedding. Elizabeth tearfully decides to go back to London, as everyone says good-bye Nick and Hallie decide that they can't lose their family again.\r\n\r\nHallie and Nick surprise Annie and Elizabeth when they arrive home. Nick then says he is not willing to lose her again, Elizabeth at first is hesitant to accept his offer but then realizes she has loved him all along. The two then share a passionate kiss and get remarried upon the same ship. The movie ends with photos from the wedding and Martin surprising Chessy by popping the question.\r\n\r\nAs far as remakes go, this one has a lot to offer for both the adults and kids. The humor and hijinks are hilarious and very well-done, similar to \"Home Alone\" and \"Dennis the Menace\". The cast does a good job portraying their characters and there are times you can feel the emotions they are going through. It's a wonderful remake and a very good film from Walt Disney Pictures. Highly Recommended.", "Really good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nHaving recently watched the original, this movie does a rather nice job of following it beat for beat.  Now, it's not the same movie, but it follows the same format, with modernization and punch-ups throughout the movie.  \r\n\r\nAs someone who complains about deviation from the source material, I approve the changes here.  Sadly, they kept the twins carrying the movie, which means Lindsay Lohan was doing double work, but you could hardly tell.  The green screen and clone work in this is actually really well done for late 1990's.\r\n\r\nThe most important aspect is that the movie retained its charm in re-uniting a lost / separated family.", "Entertaining and sweet. Just as good as the 1961 original, which probably edges this ever so slightly but they are both terrific films.\r\n\r\n1998's <em>'The Parent Trap'</em> features Lindsay Lohan in the dual role, she is excellent as Hallie and Annie - Hayley Mills from '61 would be my pick as the sisters, but again it's a tremendous piece of casting.\r\n\r\nIt's also a tight call between the parents, with Dennis Quaid (Nick) and Natasha Richardson (Liz) in those roles here - they have believable chemistry, which is key. Elsewhere in this '98 remake, Elaine Hendrix (Meredith) and Lisa Ann Walter (Chessy) are good.\r\n\r\nThe camera work et al. is impressive. Though, just like the first film, the run time could probably have been shorter. Not that that's a big negative, as this film is very much enjoyable to watch. Recommended."], ["> Probably the best live-shot Cinderella I've seen.\r\n\r\nDisney has done it again. Everybody knows Cinderella story and what this film gave was as it is with the help of modern CGI works. When I heard about the Disney's live-shot version is getting ready, I had a serious doubt, but not anymore. Nowadays, the filmmakers know how to pull it off a big budget movie with ease. Especially from Hollywood, if one market fails, it will raise in another as the recent example was 'Age of Extinction'. I am glad this movie met a great success despite it was not a surprise material as a story, but was as the quality of product.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs nearly for 100 minutes, that does not feel too long as the narration had a wonderful pace. Everything was awesomely handled by the director of 'Thor'. It's a new era of the live-shot movies, which borrows the stories from the fairytales, folklore and classical animations. Recent 'Maleficent' was one of the great examples and this film as well enters the book of triumph.\r\n\r\nLily James was very good, I haven't seen her much, because she's kind of a new actress in the spotlight. She's cute and adorable, I love to see her in many movies in the future. While Cate Blanchett, I never had any disbelief in her and she delivered it perfectly. An ideal movie for a family to watch at the weekend. I think children would love it, so at least watch it for them, with them.\r\n\r\n7/10", "Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nI'm honestly concerned that this isn't a movie that anyone is going to watch again and again, but it's a solid watch, and a definite improvement over the 1950 animated classic, though I can't say this touches \"Ever After\" for me.\r\n\r\nThe original story was somewhat lacking, but had fantastic animation for the time, along with voice acting and writing parallel with the movies of its time.  I'm somewhat sad to say that is a fair difference in quality compared to modern standards.\r\n\r\nDisney very much kept this dumbed down for younger audiences, and I expect them to have more fun with scenes like \"lizard footman eats a fly\", but in the very least they steered away from realistic cg talking animals (a creepy factor in many of the live action remakes), though they do make a very specific nod to it at the beginning of the movie.\r\n\r\nWhile I do think they managed to improve on almost ever facet of the original, it certainly isn't without flaws.\r\n\r\nThe casting is all over the place, which, I'm sure, affected the odd character development.  Oddly, the less important characters, the men, in this case, are fine, I really have zero to say other than I rather like Nonso Anozie in anything he's in, and I did think the bit about \"Kit\" was a rather inspired thing.\r\n\r\nI understand that Kate Winslet has had a villainous kick the past few years, and she plays \"stuck up snoot\" very well, but seeing Helena Bonham Carter come in to give us \"the fairy godmother who ain't got time for dat\" really makes me wonder if they just weren't paying her enough to care.  It would have made more sense to let Winslet elevate the fairy godmother (one of the only things that really wasn't) and let Carter goes Bellatrix Lestrange as the Wicked Stepmother.\r\n\r\nSophie McShera did a marvelous job of making me hate her character, and Holliday Grainger kept making me see Katherine Heigl if we could keep her away from tanning beds, so they both did a marvelous job as wicked stepsisters (honestly, probably the best performances of the movie).\r\n\r\nFor some reason though, they made a very strange decision to make all the wicked women gingers, though not with a very convincing dye job.  I don't know if it was supposed to be representative of their tacky fashion and the ability to dye hair at the time, or if Disney really thinks gingers don't have a soul, but it was a blaring message, if illegible.\r\n\r\nWhat makes me think that they don't care at all is Lily James.  She's lovely, she did a good job with the role as written, and I'm dying to see her in anything else to see if any of the oddities were her, or she's done just as good as Winslet with the roles they were given.  \r\n\r\nCinderella is traditionally a \"fairest in the land\" look, given that it's the middle of Europe, I imagine northern was exotic once upon a time, or at least certain people thought so she is traditionally very blonde and very fair.  Lily James is neither (in this, despite some of the posters), so I thought they were taking a more Germanic look with a more honey colored hair....but it is also very oddly colored, and perhaps we wouldn't have notice if it wasn't for her very prominent BLACK eyebrows (which I have nothing against, I actually think they're lovely) which would have been simple enough to die to match.  Alternatively they could have abandoned blonde altogether (plenty of versions do).  It is just very odd to spend millions of dollars to do something purposefully (and repetitively) to make it look like they don't care and objectively make their movie worse.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's this sort of attitude that seeps into the movie at different points.  It could have been a masterpiece, but instead, everyone knows it's a guaranteed paycheck on the title alone and made something that ends up being rather average despite itself.", "An improvement on Disney's past attempt from 1950.\r\n\r\nI do like the animated version from the studio, but this 2015 release of <em>'Cinderella'</em> makes for a more enjoyable experience in my eyes. Lily James and Richard Madden are smart choices to play Cinderella and Prince, while Cate Blanchett is impressive as the Stepmother. Helena Bonham Carter (Fairy Godmother), Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd (Grand Duke) and Nonso Anozie (Captain) are also noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe premise has a few changes, the ending plays out slightly differently compared to the '50 production - to positive effect. It also makes the nastiness of Blanchett's character unmistakably clear, I actually felt hatred for her - which wasn't the case, at least to the same extent, with the original.\r\n\r\nGood viewing.", "The best reviewer of Cinderella (2015) might be a child, for its message of kindness and courage wrapped in the Disney classic and illuminated through the eyes and smiles of Lily James (Ella), Richard Madden (\"Mr. Kit\"), Haley Atwell (Ella's mother) et al. calls out the beauty and virtue of child-like simplicity.  I think the great accomplishment of Lily James is her non-verbal communication of this central theme to \"have courage and be kind\" in the midst of the vicissitudes of life, just as Cate Blanchett's non-verbal communication of jaded bitterness masterfully supplies the melancholy contrast of devious conniving.   James brings love into her little world while Blanchett's legacy is her two spoiled rotten daughters played marvelously by Holliday Granger and Sophie McShera.  This remake brings a lot of humor to help get the message across-- primarily in Helen Botham Carter, the hairy Godfather, I mean, the fairy Godmother-- whose quirky kindness charms and delights.  The animals too, as Ella's constant companions, add to the humor.  The casting in this film utilizes the actors' talents quite well. I found myself watching this over and over again, at least parts of it, for the sheer joy of its message.  In a world of negativity, there is something very real about simplicity and purity, if only in a love fantasy.  \r\nA final note must be added about the music-- it contributes its share to the film's message most beautifully.", "Lily James takes the title role in this colourful telling of the original rags to riches story.

The Sherman brothers are on top form with some toe-tappers and delightful ballads that are sung by the cast we can see, often accompanied by some magical visual effects or some ensemble dances, and they help to convey a story of love, kindness and affection, of curiosity and ultimately, I felt anyway, of keeping things in perspective. Of getting your priorities straight. Sure, the animation section in the zoo is maybe a little bit long, but for the most part this 2\u00bc hour long extravaganza is engagingly entertaining with Andrews and Van Dyke creating a chemistry all of their own; a practically perfect supporting cast - particularly Johns - and a story that glows in it's own simplicity."], ["I loved the movie.

I hope they Tim Burton will make the original movie though. The montage in the movie looks nice when they did the flashback. I love the colors. Anne Hathaway is great. I felt like watching a real life Disney princess. Of course Helena Bonham Carter is magnificent. With her big head that looks really natural, it adds to her funny character.

(It gets a 6/10 on the Dragon-Scale, because the Jabberwocky has an amazing design and it's walking looks so off-putting.)_\r\n\r\nAlice... who hasn't heard of or watched it at some point? This is a sequel to the original, Alice is now 19 when she returns to Wonderland. Which... she has no obvious memories of, which, for an adventure with the scope she undertook when she was younger, I find a little hard to believe. \r\n\r\nShe never acknowledges having any memories of Wonderland until the end of the movie. Which again, strikes me as odd, because even if she would write off her earlier adventure as a dream, you'd still acknowledge having seen it all before, right? Perhaps I'm just overthinking this, but even subconsciously you'd recognize some of the things you see... right?\r\n\r\nIn any case, Wonderland has gotten a lot darker and has gotten a healthy CGI coating. Which, might not seem super today, but I think it gives everything a very 'this is not reality' vibe. Which works in Underland's favor in my opinion, it's chaotic, lacking in conventional logic and absolutely infused with magic. And it's bizarre denizens all immediately pop out at you, with many strange shapes, weird behavioral tics and tend to defy the laws of physics.\r\n\r\nThe story is a coming of age story, which is immediately set up in the beginning as Alice is forced into a marriage with someone she barely knows. Something not uncommon for the time it is set in. And during the movie she figures out who she is, someone who'll do things her own way, prophecies and expectations be damned. Despite not being the easiest way, everything still falls into place eventually and the prophecy fulfills itself.\r\n\r\nWhen she comes back to her reality, she turns down her chosen fianc\u00e9, gives everyone she's encountered at her engagement party some snappy one-liners, which, they all seem to take in stride. She then takes up her father's passion to establish brave new trade-routes all the way to China. Which, perhaps feels a little _too_ easy. (Considering everyone was calling her father insane for his plans, which she promptly takes a step further.) But then again, this is a story with talking rabbits, a hookah smoking caterpillar and playing card knights, so perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a fun watch with a satisfying payoff in the end!", "Wasn't expecting much out of this movie.

I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I might've on this viewing, but it is still a film I'd recommend for sure - it's very good.\r\n\r\nI'm yet to see a bad - heck, even a just mildly good - film from Leonardo DiCaprio, which remains the case after this. It's probably the weakest performance I've seen from DiCaprio so far, though that's just through process of elimination as he's still impressive here as Romeo. Claire Danes (Juliet) merits props, also.\r\n\r\nJohn Leguizamo (Tybalt) is the pick of the rest of the cast, which also includes the likes of Paul Sorvino, Miriam Margolyes and Paul Rudd. Speaking of the casting, apparently 14-year-old Natalie Portman was originally cast to star alongside DiCaprio (then 21... dodgy!).\r\n\r\nI love the modern day set up and how they bring this famous tale to life in it, though I do think the choice to use Shakespearean dialogue was perhaps the wrong call. It's not like I didn't appreciate it, but it does feel a bit forced and unnatural at times - still cool that they did it, mind.", "Shakespeare is still getting work in Hollywood, and probably always will...\r\n\r\n... but I like updated modern Shakespeare when it comes in the form of West Side Story, She's all That, Overboard (all the other million or so Rom-Coms based off of The Taming of the Shrew) and not when the film is modern day with Shakespearean English and... yeah.\r\n\r\nToo much of a Juxtaposition for me.\r\n\r\nThe kind of WWII update of Richard III wasn't bad, but it wasn't really taking Richard II, putting it in a different time, and keeping almost everything else intact.\r\n\r\nI guess what I am saying is that it didn't mesh well for me.", "Baz Luhrmann has relocated this classic to modern day Verona Beach and introduced a contemporary sound track to complement much of the original dialogue from the bard's story of true love, revenge and, quite possibly, the greatest tragedy ever written in the English language. The families \"Montague\" and \"Capulet\" have been feuding since God was a boy. The uneasy truce between them is to be severely tested when \"Romeo\" (Leonardo DiCaprio) and \"Juliet\" (Clare Danes) fall in love. Being from each of these warring tribes, they must keep their love clandestine in order to avoid conflict. As their affection grows, that secret proves harder and harder to keep - especially as \"Juliet\" has been betrothed and her father is determined that she shall be in the church on Tuesday next! I'm sure you all know the story of the \"star-crossed lovers\" and I rather enjoyed this adaptation. Unlike \"Carmen Jones\" (1954) which I did not think worked well being relocated, this does. The eclectic contrast between the motor cars, the revolvers and the original old English text is quite effective. The effort from DiCaprio gets better as the film progresses and by the denouement neither he nor Danes are half bad. Harold Perrineau is also competent as the brave \"Mercutio\" and the conniving \"Tybalt\" is well covered by John Leguizamo. Purists may well not admire the abridging of this lengthy story though. It is quite heavily condensed and at times that does rob the film of much of the original nuance - not that Luhrmann ever really concentrates on nuance anyway - but I'd rather look on this as an evolution of the story for modern times rather than a straight retelling.

It is based on \u201cTransformers\u201d, an animated series for children and teenagers that was quite successful in the 80s and 90s, but which I have to confess I never saw. Recently, Marvel invested millions in live-action films and revived this universe. I haven't seen them in full yet, but this is where I get to know the characters better. What did I expect from this movie? A bit of easy entertainment, assuming the movie would at least do the work of better introducing the characters and story. That's not what I found.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this is an \u201cinward-facing\u201d film, that is, it is aimed almost exclusively at an audience that already knows the animated series and the characters. Therefore, there are no explanations or introductions, anyone who wants to understand something should go and see the series. Three points down, I thought: I don't feel obligated to watch the series to understand the movie, I can just watch something else and send this movie to the trash can, where it belongs.\r\n\r\nDespite everything, I saw the film, and after reading a little about the animated series on the Internet, I understood that the film kills a lot of characters that, until then, were central to the plot, and that the film was released between two seasons, introducing characters who would play a relevant role later. Not being an expert, I wonder to what extent the film was not a kind of publicity move, either for the new season or for the merchandising that is usually associated with this type of television material.\r\n\r\nI won't waste my time describing the script, which involves a giant robot that devours planets and the war between the Decepticons and the Autobots, robotic races of alien origin that fight each other. What I can say is that, in addition to being an uninteresting film that will not captivate those who don't know the series, it has a very confusing and far-fetched plot.\r\n\r\nThe graphics and animations have that kind of quality you find in a lot of animated material from the late 80's, and it made me think about possible influences of Japanese and Korean \"anime\" on American production. Moreover, just a word to salute the effort that Orson Welles must have made to give voice to one of the creatures, at a stage when he was practically at death's door. The distinguished actor would die days after having recorded the material that was used in this film."], ["If you like children's story, you would love this movie about how the world is shaped from their eyes.\r\n\r\nIf you don't ... you may find some entertainment in the picture of Southern US and the racial fight that was taking place at the time ...", "The part Gregory Peck played in this was reportedly his most favorite role.  And he does a marvelous job of it too, as Atticus Finch, the Southern lawyer who agrees to take on the case of a black man falsely accused of rape.  The story, from Harper Lee's classic novel, is in itself wonderful. It's filled with brilliant and iconic sequences, just a couple memorable ones being the dramatic courtroom scenes where Finch tries his best to make the prejudiced townsfolk see sense, and the intriguing side-plot of his children's growing curiosity and involvement with their eccentric, hermit-like neighbor that no one's ever actually seen. He is, of course, Arthur (Boo) Radley, played by none other than Robert Duvall in his feature film debut.\r\n\r\nWould I recommend?  Yes, without a doubt, to anyone and everyone who knows how to enjoy a great film.", "**A striking, culturally relevant and indisputably important film.**\r\n\r\nIt is not very rare to see that an actor's career, however prolific it may be, ends up being especially remembered thanks to his participation in a very small set of films, or even for his participation in a single film. I don't see this as a demerit, but as something unavoidable: only a very limited set of films ends up surviving the test of time and becoming culturally and historically relevant. Gregory Peck was an actor of great importance in his time, one of the faces of honesty and fairness, since he almost always played characters imbued with great honesty and nobility of intentions. As such, he took place in a wide range of films... but let's be honest, it is with this film that the actor reaches the peak of his career, and it is here that he achieves the greatest recognition and relevance as an actor.\r\n\r\nThe film brings to the screen the slightly autobiographical novel by Harper Lee. Strongly inspired by the figure of her father, and by passages from her childhood, the author conceived a story in which an honest and committed lawyer struggles to defend a black prisoner, convinced of his innocence in the face of accusations of rape and aggression against a white minor. Of course, it all takes place in the American South, where racial prejudice runs rampant, as everyone knows. In the midst of all this, a sub-plot also develops, involving a reclusive, mentally weak neighbor, who creates a liking for the lawyer's daughter.\r\n\r\nI'll start by saying that I've never read the original book, so I'm not sure if the movie does justice to its content. However, when preparing this text, I concluded that the writer watched some footage at the invitation of the production and participated in the works with her collaboration, which leaves me with the conviction that the film sought to respect the literary work. Directed by Robert Mulligan, the film is a very convincing drama, but it takes a while to get into gear and to captivate our attention, which is initially invited to focus on children, on the way they behave and interact with the world around then. It will be, moreover, through the eyes of one of them, that we will observe the events.\r\n\r\nAs I said, it is in this film that Gregory Peck reaches the highest point of his career, giving us an inspired, profound and emotional interpretation of the main character. He was one of the most relevant actors of his time and there are a number of other films where he shines and deserves a closer look from us, but this is where he immortalizes himself. Without coincidence, this is where the actor receives his Oscar for Best Actor, after being nominated four times. Despite being very young, Mary Badham's performance and a silent appearance by a young Robert Duvall are also worth noting.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is quite discreet and gives the audience plenty of room to focus on the story told. There are no great visual gimmicks, there are no noteworthy effects, but we have excellent black-and-white cinematography with occasional artistic notes and a good filming work. The editing was also very well done, and gave the film a pleasant pace. It takes a while to really become interesting, but if we give the film the opportunity it requires, it will give us an enjoyable story, which we will gladly follow until the end. The soundtrack also deserves praise for its apparent ingenuity, as well as the opening credits and its graphics and visuals."], ["So poor little rich kid \"Harold\" (Bud Cort) really does like a bit of attention seeking - constantly vying for the recognition of his mother by faking every more outlandish suicide attempts. Things is, she (Vivian Pickles) is pretty impervious to his antics and so he seeks something to alleviate his boredom elsewhere... He starts attending funerals. That's where he encounters the eccentric \"Maude\" (Ruth Gordon) who also has a penchant for the ceremonies - and for also pinching a car from the cemetery for a bit of a joyride afterwards. As his mother increases her activities in finding him a love match, \"Harold\" finds himself and his new friend spending more and more time together and he begins to learn that her live today policy is vibrant, exhilarating and contagious! Their bond grows ever stronger as the pair begin to rely more and more on each other, even to fall in love! There's a great dynamic between Cort and Gordon here. She brings out the best in her young acting companion with confident and engaging performances from both delivering a story that is funny, poignant and surreal - in almost equal measure. At times it's a touch on the wordy side, but Pickles is fun as the mother and the whole story is one of interesting characters and truth. It is short and sweet and right from the start we never get to hang around long before the pace picks up again. Great fun.", "**Knowing how to live or knowing how to die are virtues, difficult and debatable themes that a film almost never has the courage to address.**\r\n\r\nHarold is a young man, just arrived at adulthood, who has a morbid fascination with death: he drives hearses, goes to funerals for \u201cfun\u201d, rehearses his own suicide a thousand and one times. He will change under the influence of an elderly woman, whose desire to live every moment to the fullest leads her to very incorrect attitudes, such as \u201cborrowing\u201d other people's things without even bothering to ask for them. In a way, both have to learn from each other, and the film shows us this mutual learning process, and the special bond that is created between them.\r\n\r\nBlack comedies are never consensual, as you know, but this one is especially touching and charged with a positive spirit. The film tackles difficult, even hard themes, with a certain spirit of informality and lightness that, however, does not reduce or diminish them: what it means to die, how to live, how to enjoy life or know how to die with dignity, how to educate and understand a child, anyway. For this reason, and due to the dark comic load, it is not an easy film and will displease certain people either because of its humor or because of the themes it addresses.\r\n\r\nThe film has good production values, but still feels very cheap. The film is set in the US, but it's so inherently British that we forget about it and assume it's all set in some rural English corner. We have tasteful cinematography, low contrast and good lighting, we have good sets and costumes. I would particularly highlight the houses of Harold and Maude, because they couldn't be more different and, at the same time, more characterizing their personalities: an old-fashioned mansion turned to the past and a pleasant little house with cozy details. There's nothing very flashy, technically, and the only negative call to attention goes to the soundtrack, strident and overly flashy.\r\n\r\nI couldn't close this text without praising the impeccable work of Bud Cort, an actor I've never seen before and who doesn't seem to have made much of a career in cinema, and the inspired performance of his counterpart, Ruth Gordon, a high-level veteran who played a huge variety of roles over the next few years."], [], ["I never get tired of the idea that someone would think of Groucho Marx is the perfect man to lead a nation into war.

Would he understand the gesture?**\r\n\r\nWho would have thought that this film is almost a hundred years old? I just saw it, and it is fresher and lusher than many vegetables in the supermarket! Many people no longer know who the Marx Brothers are, but a hundred years ago, at a time when there were no internet memes (or the internet), they were the kings of comedy, and it's always worth seeing what they did. They passed away a long time ago, but they left us a polite, intelligent, sharp, accessible humor that the whole family can see.\r\n\r\nThe film was released in 1933, at a time dominated by the imminent threats of war. It reminds us of our own time, doesn't it? One hundred years later, we continue to make the same mistakes and show God that we have learned nothing from them. The film makes fun of this by giving us a portrait of a bankrupt country led by an incompetent man, very vain, arrogant and surrounded by sycophants who treat him as a savior of the nation. It could be Mussolini, or Hitler... and the explicit criticism of European dictators could not be sharper today, if we think about some tyrants of our time.\r\n\r\nThe film is dominated by the four Marxes: Zeppo, in his last appearance as a member of the group, has a much more solid character than usual and as a result we never feel that he is too much in the film. Chico also does very well. Harpo does what he's used us to, managing to be funny without saying a word and putting all his tricks as a mime and vaudeville clown to good use. Groucho, as usual, intelligently leads the group. The king of ready answers couldn't have a quicker wit or a sharper tongue. In addition, we have Margaret Dumont in a skillful and healthy collaboration with them.\r\n\r\nGood sets and very well-imagined costumes help us compose Freedonia, a republic on the verge of collapse, bankruptcy and a foreign invasion. There is an unbelievable dose of anthological scenes in this film, from the motorcycle joke with the sidecar to the joke with the mirror.

It is essentially a series of short stories - each as different from the other as you can imagine. I think that's the most important principle when enjoying this - you must use your imagination. The representations try, with varying degrees of success, to put more defined, ambiguous and occasionally abstract imagery alongside the music - some with humour (frequently using animals, birds, insects etc.) through to far more sinister and challenging imagery, that at times reminded me of something Fritz Lang might have produced in the 1920s. It is a little too episodically presented - and the intermission needlessly robs it of flow but as a colourful introduction to classical music it takes some beating.

The more she spends time with them, however, the more she discovers she can\u2019t stand them. Enter mysterious new kid, JD (Christian Slater), who has a macabre solution to Veronica\u2019s conundrum.   \r\n\r\nThis is an oddball teen movie that tries to be edgy and amusing with its black humor and overt cussing. Future movies were influenced by it, like \u201cJawbreaker\u201d (1999) and maybe even \u201cMean Girls\u201d (2004). The commentary on peer pressure, teen suicide and the maiming destructiveness of cliques is potent. Teens can be misled by the \u201cpopular\u201d students, yes, but they can also be misled by the outcasts.   \r\n\r\nSlater stands out as a sorta dark Fonz of the late 80s, easily one of his best roles ever. Ryder is surprisingly good as the protagonist. I say \u201csurprisingly\u201d because I was never big on her (although I didn\u2019t dislike her either). The first act is quite good, but the story gets humdrum in the middle; thankfully, the last 20 minutes perk up. The late 80\u2019s ambiance is to die for.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to give it away, but the original ending was way more morbid. They had an alternative ending that they didn\u2019t go with either. Apparently the studio pressured the writer/director to go with the theatrical ending, which I approve. It\u2019s a story of redemption. Being misled by corrupt people for a season doesn\u2019t define a person forever.                       \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hours & 43 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles (the high school) and surrounding area (Santa Monica, Tujunga and Pasadena). WRITER: Daniel Waters.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+", "This movie is a high school satire done absolutely amazingly. It's everything current high school dramas wish they were. It's dark, funny, but does not lose any of its meaning to stupid jokes. It perfectly shows the hell that is high school (and society as a whole). Just like in high school, there are Marthas and Heathers everywhere in life. \r\n\r\nJ.D. is a great villain, because even though from his very introduction, we know he's a messed up person who does bad things, yet you start to empathize with him just like Veronica. It shows that, as a society, we go to great lengths to defend white men and their actions. \r\n\r\nHeathers is furthermore also obviously a critique on the social hierarchies that exist in the world. It shows this on a smaller scale, high school. As J.D. nicely sums up towards the end of the movie: \".. because high school IS society\". The Heathers rule the school and this movie really shows as to why that is. It's a system, that puts certain people at the top, like Heathers, and other _Martha's_ at the bottom. Murdering Heather Chandler might seem like a way to disrupt this hierarchy, and restore society to a pure form, but that is not the case. Heather Chandler does not equal her power, that's just a role she filled in the bigger system around them. Her being gone doesn't remove that role, it just passes it on to the next best fit. \r\n\r\nIn this movie, colors play a significant role. Heather Chandler being red represents anger and her dominance. Heather McNamara being yellow represents her kind soul, but also her weakness. Heather Duke's green represents her jealousy of Chandler. Veronica's signature color is blue which represents intelligence, but after having murdered Heather Chandler she wears a purple outfit. As you may know, blue and red make purple. I see this as Heather Chandlers 'evilness' affecting Veronica as well. Veronica might think she's rid the world of evil, yet she's simply become evil herself."], ["Your mind refuses to face the conclusion.\r\n\r\nForbidden Planet is directed by Fred M. Wilcox and stars Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen. Screenplay is written by Cyril Hume from an original story by Irving Block & Allen Adler (original title being Fatal Planet). It is a CinemaScope production out of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and is shot in Eastman Color (not Metrocolor as suggested on some sources) by cinematographer George J. Folsey. The piece features a novel musical score (credited as \"electronic tonalities\") by Louis & Bebe Barron. \r\n\r\nLoosely based around William Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\", the story sees Nielsen and the crew of the C-57D spaceship sent to the remote planet of Altair IV. Where once was a colony of Earthlings, now the only inhabitants are Dr Morbius (Pidgeon), his daughter Altaira (Francis) and Robby, a highly sophisticated Robot that Morbius has built. It transpires from Morbius that all civilisations on Altair IV were wiped out by an unseen force, but not before he himself was able to use some of the knowledge gained from the Krell race to build Robby and the Plastic Educator. However, it's not before long something starts stalking and killing the men of the C-57D. They must get to the bottom of the mystery or they too will be wiped out. \r\n\r\nThe 50s was of course the decade of the \"B\" movie. A decade where science fiction schlockers and creaky creature features ruled the drive in theatres. As paranoia of potential nuclear war and technology spiralling out of control gripped America, film studios grasped the opportunity to make a cash killing whilst providing an entertainment stress release courtesy of science fiction based movies. Be it giant insects, creatures or alien invaders, there were some fun - some bad - and some rather smart movies that hit the silver screen. Falling into the latter category is \"Forbidden Planet\", an intelligent and excellently produced movie that is one of the few that genuinely holds up well over 60 years since it was first released. To delve further would be unfair to potential newcomers to the film, but in short the piece carries interesting motifs such as sexual awakening, the power of the sub-conscious, or more appropriately the perils of a repressed conscious. Basically it's a Freudian twister, and then some. \r\n\r\nAlso lifting Forbidden Planet a long way above those men in rubber suit movies of the decade is the production value of the piece. True, the budget was considerably larger than what was normally afforded the genre (almost $5 million), but every penny is up there on the screen. The CinemaScope really brings to the front the sets and visual effects, while the Eastman Color fully enhances the animations and matte paintings on offer. The whole look and feel of the movie points to it being later than 1956, so it's no surprise to see musing on the home format extras such luminaries like Spielberg, Lucas, Cameron & Scott, since Forbidden Planet has influenced as much as it has enthralled. \r\n\r\nWith one of the cleverest stories in the genre, one of its best ever robots (Robby would become a star all on his own) and certainly the best spaceship landing ever, \"Forbidden Planet\" is a genre high point and essential viewing for those interested in said genre pieces. 9/10", "**_The 50's prototype Sci-Fi film and... Anne Francis_**\r\n\r\nI didn't see \"Forbidden Planet\" (1956) until a full four decades after it's debut. I've seen it a few more times since then and here's what strikes me:\r\n\r\nFor one, although Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is undeniably great, practically every primary aspect of Trek is present in \"Forbidden Planet,\" which was released almost a decade before the first Star Trek pilot episode was produced (!). You name it: warp drive, Captain/First Officer/Doctor triumvirate, alluring space females, beam down/up (in a visual sense, at least), etc., it's all here in \"Forbidden Planet.\"\r\n\r\nThe flick combines Shakespeare's The Tempest with psychological concepts. The invisible id monster is horrifying when finally viewed. It looks like a serious rendition of the Tasmanian Devil. The concept of the monster is a fascinating revelation and I wasn't expecting such mature commentary in a 50's sci-fi flick.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Dr. Morbius' elaboration on the former inhabitants of his planet, the Krell, is awe-inspiring to this day and the archaic special effects hold up well. This was the first major film to be set wholly in space and one of the first to feature an entirely electronic score (perhaps better described as a soundtrack).\r\n\r\nOne thing that really blows me away every time I catch this flick is, of course, Anne Francis, who plays Altaira (or Alta for short), in her cute space outfits.\r\n\r\nI've heard some people complain about the scene where we are led to believe that Alta (Francis) is skinny-dipping, only to plainly observe that she's wearing a loose skin-colored bathing suit. Is this a cop-out on the filmmakers' part because it was 1956? Not at all because the bathing suit is clearly visible once she steps out of the water. Despite her sheltered innocent nature, let's give Alta some credit -- she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir his mounting desire (which obviously worked).\r\n\r\nPlease remember that \"Forbidden Planet\" is from 1956 and so understandably has dated aspects, like the sound effects, small portions of goofy dialogue, the Captain's communicator, etc. Regardless, it must be HAILED as the honored blueprint for numerous sci-fi films and TV series to come.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot entirely in the studio in Culver City, SoCal.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A", "**A sci-fi landmark that, however, is quite dated and has aged poorly.**\r\n\r\nI confess that I expected more from this film. Its impact at the time is undeniable, and it is a renowned classic of sci-fi cinema. In fact, we can almost say that it is part of the \u201cpantheon\u201d of founding films of this genre of cinema, as it was one of the first big-budget sci-fi films with a great public impact.\r\n\r\nThe best thing this film has to give us is its almost inexhaustible creativity. It is quite evident that the team of creators had time to create and develop ideas and the studio decided to allow its specialists wide margin of maneuver. When this is combined with an appropriate budget and a serious investment in high quality special, visual and sound effects, we have what it takes for a film that is visually impactful and capable of seducing us.\r\n\r\nI can only imagine how the public at the time reacted to this film: my reaction is different. In fact, our perspective has to be different: more than sixty years have passed since the premiere and the technical and technological advances in cinema, as we know, have accustomed us to other types of visuals and effects, and thus, this film does not manages to surprise and delight in the same way it enchanted the public when it was made. This is not a defect of the film, it is almost a \u201cdefect\u201d of the audience, which in this specific case is me.\r\n\r\nThe cast has some well-known names. It was interesting to see Leslie Nielsen much younger and playing a radically different type of role than the ones I'm more used to seeing. Walter Pidgeon also does a very good job and, despite not liking the character, I recognize Anne Francis' effort and talent. And despite being a character and not an actor, Robbie is delightfully likeable.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this film turns out to be its age: it is a dated film that has aged quite poorly, and may have difficulty finding new audiences capable of enjoying it nowadays. But it wasn't because of the visual issues and effects that I found it so dated. It was due to the intrinsic machismo in the plot, in the conception of the characters and in the idiotic romance that is included in the film. The film is a mirror of a mentality that, for us, is unacceptable and regressive, in which women are obedient and submissive to any and all male desires. I can foresee some of my friends screaming with the force of their indignation if they had to see this film. Since I am not even remotely close to feminist causes, this is not a problem for me, but it is still a sign of how dated this film is.", "\"Dr. Morbius\" (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter \"Altaira\" (Anne Francis) are getting along fine on their planet of \"Altair 4\" when they receive a radio signal from an incoming ship.

He informs the captain \"Adams\" (Leslie Nielsen) and the doctor \"Ostrow\" (Warren Stevens) that they all died mysteriously, including his own wife, but that things were all settled now.

It stars Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross and Strother Martin. A Panavision/De Luxe production with music by Burt Bacharach and cinematography by Conrad Hall.\r\n\r\nNot exactly a hit with the critics of the time, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had no such problems at the box office or with longevity of popularity. It is still today one of the few Western films that none Western fans enjoy immensely. Much of this can be attributed to the wonderful buddy buddy chemistry between Newman and Redford, and of course the general blending of ragamuffin drama with cheeky chappy comedy.\r\n\r\nThe casting as finished was not exactly set in stone, Newman was always in but was originally going to play the part of Sundance. McQueen was pencilled in for Cassidy, as was Lemmon while Beatty was mooted as well, but eventually a chance was taken on Redford and Newman switched to the role of Cassidy. On such things can a movie be made or broken, as it turned out it was the ace in the pack as infamously legendary characters were brought vividly to life.\r\n\r\nOnly based on the basic real life facts of the Hole-in-the-Wall gang led by Butch Cassidy, the film follows the simple formula of two lovable rogue entrepreneurs being chased by a Pinkerton posse whilst robbing their way to a new life in Bolivia. A gorgeous sepia opening sets the standard for the visual treats to follow, with over a quarter of the film being an extended chase sequence through the landscapes. As Hill and Goldman (Academy Award Best Story/Screenplay) provide the tension in the sequences, Conrad Hall (Academy Award Best Cinematography) brings clarity of beauty that's blended with dust strewn sweat.\r\n\r\nThe music by Burt Bacharach (Academy Award Best Music) has not always gone down well with critics and fans alike, especially the pivotal \"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head\" (song by country singer B.J. Thomas). But in the context of the scenes, and the changing of the West (even the Western movie in fact), the music mostly works. Yes, \"Raindrops\" is a touch corny in essence, but the accompanying sequences as the bicycle replaces the horse for a major metaphor - and the warmth of the Etta Place (Ross a little bland) and Cassidy friendship is born out - it's hardly a film killer. In fact it's a daring move by the makers.\r\n\r\nHugely influential on Westerns that would follow and spawning further tales of the exploits of Butch and Sundance, Hill's movie has well and truly earned its much loved reputation. With the constant by-play between Redford and Newman always engaging (who are those guys?), a number of iconic scenes firmly ensconced in movie folklore, and technical smarts to cherish, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid never takes its foot of the pedal or its grip on your heart. Because as the freeze frame sepia ending passes muster as a blaze of glory, it's indeed true that Hill, Hall, Goldman, Newman and Redford have made a true Western classic. 9/10\r\n", "I found this movie to be entertaining and intelligent, sticking surprisingly close to real events a lot of the time.

Apparently s9me viewers feel it can\u2019t decide whether it is a western or a comedy, but as an author who writes novels that cross genres a bit, I do not mind seeing it in films.\r\n\r\nThe scenery is grand and the old time photography that is featured at times is a neat addition.

I remember it because while I thought it was corny, one hot girl in the theater started laughing and commenting on how funny it was. I thought it was ordinary, but some people really ate this stuff up.\r\nButch (Newman) is the thinker, and Sundance is the muscle. Like I say, the comedy is of the lightly likable sort.

Eventually the authorities catch up with them, and after a period of trying to go straight, they succumb to boredom and along with \"Etta\" (Katharine Ross) they flee to Bolivia to start all over again. It's this bit of the the film that I enjoyed most - thanks in no small part to a few short scenes from the always personable Strother Martin (\"Percy Garris\") before an ending that - along with the scene featuring Newman and Ross on their bicycle - is the stuff of cinema legend. The films looks good - the use of still photography to tell aspects of the story and the innovative use of the Bacharach and David soundtrack works well to sustain and to vary the pace of this film. It is a classy piece of cinema well worth watching some 50 years after it was made.", "**Unique among the westerns, we understand this film better in the light of the time in which it was made.**\r\n\r\nButch Cassidy, Sundance Kid and the Hole in the Wall gang are in the \u201cHall of Fame\u201d of the greatest thieves and robbers of the Old West. They had a long, varied and violent criminal career, with spectacular robberies of trains, stagecoaches and banks before moving to South America, where they spent all their money before returned to their old ways. They were persecuted by authorities in Argentina, Chile and Bolivia, where they apparently met their death at the hands of law enforcement. And I say \u201capparently\u201d because, in fact, there are several theories that say that the two thieves somehow survived, and may have returned to US soil under the cover of new identities. True legends like that are always difficult to kill and, even in death, find a way to survive and endure in our imagination.\r\n\r\nDirected by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman, the film is quite good and very well done, trying to follow the path of the two robbers. However, it is far from being a faithful portrayal of the facts, giving us instead a story sympathetic to the thieves, without the inflated patriotism of western films. It is necessary to consider that the film was made and released in 1969, in the midst of social protests that occurred due to the Sexual Revolution and the challenge to conventional values and concepts and, also, against the US participation in the Vietnam War. At a time of social and political turmoil, when many felt embarrassed by the attitudes of the USA, the film transforms each heist by Cassidy and Kid into an act of rebellion, of fight against the \u201cestablishment\u201d, of disobedience and rebellion against the authorities. Of course, it's a mindset that never occurred to them, and that ignores ethical and moral issues surrounding the eventual glorification of organized crime, in addition to forgetting the innocent lives that Cassidy and Kid were sacrificing.\r\n\r\nDirector Hill did a very elegant job, especially in cinematography and footage. Look at the opening credits, or the first sequence in sepia, and the way color is gradually introduced during a cavalcade. The sets, props and costumes are also very good, although I have doubts about the historical accuracy with which they were designed. There are scenes that I can't understand in any other way than as deliberate winks at hippies, the most obvious of all being that bicycle scene, set to the suggestive melody \u201cRaindrops Keep Falling on My Head\u201d. And let's face it, there are more comedic moments than serious action.\r\n\r\nFor me, the biggest reason to see this unusual film is the impeccable performance of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, two great actors that we know well and whose talent is recognized by everyone. This is not one of the best that they have starred in, each of them has done better works, before and after, whether comic or dramatic. However, the way Newman and Redford played together is the film's greatest strength. Their partnership is remarkable, as the way they overcome each challenge. The film also features good work by Katharine Ross, who was experiencing the peak of her artistic career.", "Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford), leaders of a gang, find themselves chased by something special after a train robbery, and come up with an idea to escape to Bolivia.\r\n\r\nThey commit a robbery smartly, being so naive in other fields. The unbalance makes it hard to simply see them as bad. They are even charming, probably because of Paul Newman and Robert Redford. This movie depicts them quite objectively and gives you no stress of judging or interpreting their life, letting you enjoy the casual, a little nostalgic atmosphere symbolised by the soundtracks."], ["**The best horror film of the eighties**\r\n\r\nThis is a gem, it really is.

He is pulling all the strings and we are uncertain as to which string he is going to pull next.\r\n\r\nFrom the eerie Yorkshire countryside of the opening scenes through David's _awful_ nightmares in hospital to amusing zombie chit chat and finally the climactic slaughter in London - this film never lets up.\r\n\r\nHow many films will you find Kermit the frog sharing a scene with throat slicing, machine gun wielding mutants dressed as Nazis?\r\n\r\n- Potential Kermode", "\"Beware the moon, lads.\"\r\n\r\nStill frightening and funny 38 years later.\r\n\r\nThe transformation scene was absolutely incredible, but also really painful.

The thing is, those inside know how dangerous it's about to be out there - and the boys soon find out. It's \"David\" who wakes up in hospital, replete with some mysterious scratch marks, nightmares and claiming that they were attacked by a brutal hound. Nobody really believes him, and anyway his attention is quickly diverted by nurse \"Alex\" (Jenny Agutter) whom he visits for dinner and never leaves. Luckily she works nights, else she might have discovered that her beau doesn't just stop at a bit of gentle biting. With corpses piling up around London, he is at a loss to know where he goes at night (waking up naked in the wolf enclosure at the zoo might be the final straw) but try as he might, he can't engage the authorities with his claims. Maybe only doctor \"Hirsch\" (John Woodvine) believes that something unusual is amiss - but can he help before \"David\" does himself or anyone else more damage! Increasingly more often naked as he goes along, Naughton joins in with the spirit of this enjoyable comedy horror with enthusiasm. I wonder what might happen now if a naked man in a bush even mentioned a boy's balloons!?

The house was the scene of a mass killing a year earlier but the parents (James Brolin & Margot Kidder) didn\u2019t think it mattered and, besides, it enabled them to purchase the homestead at a much reduced price. Then strange things start happening.  \r\n\r\n\"The Amityville Horror\" (1979) was arguably the best haunted house movie up to that point in time and was hugely successful at the box office, inspiring a gazillion sequels, remakes and documentaries. There are similarities to \"The Shining\" (1980): Both movies were based on books published in 1977, but the film version of \"The Amityville Horror\" was released a year prior to \u201cThe Shining\u201d and was based on the supposedly true story of what happened to the Lutz family whereas Stephen King\u2019s novel was purely fictional.\r\n\r\nThe 2005 remake with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George deviates even further from the book and is a brisker, more modern version of the story. Yet this classic version still works as a moody and mysterious drama with horrific touches. Unlike the remake, the movie takes its time to establish and develop the characters and I appreciated this; for instance, Mr. Lutz's employee (Michael Sacks) and his spiritually curious girlfriend (Helen Shaver), as well as the two priests (Rod Steiger and Don Stroud).\r\n\r\nGene Siskel criticized it on the grounds that it wasn\u2019t enjoyable. Seriously? Since when are horror flicks supposed to be enjoyable? This is a realistic drama with some creepy paranormal things thrown on top, based on an allegedly true account. I don\u2019t think the filmmakers were shooting for \u201cenjoyable.\u201d That said, underneath the darkness the picture has a good, warm heart.\r\n\r\nWas the actual Lutz\u2019s account true or not? They seemed to have experienced some troubling things at the house during their month-long stay and passed a Polygraph by two top polygraph experts but, assuming their story wasn\u2019t concocted for profit (which many believe was the case), the events were certainly amped-up for the book & movie for the purpose of an entertaining tale. By the way, the large Dutch Colonial house still stands in Amityville, albeit the exterior was remodeled and hence the two distinctive windows appear standard.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes and was mostly shot in New Jersey as follows: Toms River (house), Point Pleasant (church), Georgian Court University in Lakewood (meeting with the hooded priest), Ocean County and Scotch Plains; as well as indoor scenes done at MGM Studios in Culver City, California; plus some shots done in Long Island, Connecticut and Glendale, California.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B"], [], ["Birds of a different feather do indeed flock together.  \r\n\r\nThe Birds is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted to screenplay by Evan Hunter from the story of the same name written by Daphne du Maurier. It stars Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy, Veronica Cartwright and Ethel Griffies. Cinematography is by Robert Burks and editing by George Tomasini.\r\n\r\nMother's love? Better to be ditched or loved?\r\n\r\nWhen animals attack! The only outright horror movie that Alfred Hitchcock ever directed, The Birds sees the great man get the utmost terror from something so amiable in our lives - Birds! Modern day critics can hark on about it being dated all they like, it still doesn't detract from what a frenzied experience \"The Birds\" can still be - let alone what it did for cinema goers in 1963! Admittedly upon small screen ventures too much is missed or under enhanced, which is a crying shame.\r\n\r\nBut it isn't dark Annie! It's a full moon.\r\n\r\nPlotting is simple in trajectory terms. Hip socialite Melanie Daniels (Hedren) has a friendly vocal joust in a pet shop with handsome Mitch Brenner (Taylor), the result of which sees Melanie, on a mischievous whim, buy a couple of lovebirds and set off for Mitch's weekend retreat out in Bodega Bay to deliver them as a show of devilish womanhood. Upon arrival in Bodega Bay, though, Melanie seems to be the spark for the birds in the area to start attacking humans, and pretty soon the attacks escalate and intensify...\r\n\r\nHitchcock and Hunter offer up no reasons or answers for what occurs in Bodega Bay (to keep it murky we learn late on via radio that other towns become affected), and famously the ending is open ended as well, forcing the audience to unravel ideas themselves. There's no musical score in the film, thus Hitchcock gets the terror and tension out of editing, bird effects and unholy sounds. The pacing is also a key area, it's a good hour before things go decidedly nasty, the wait keeps the viewer on edge, we seriously get to know the principal characters (the actors worked well by Hitch) and then the terror is unleashed. Perfect.\r\n\r\nHitchcock's skill at staging a memorable scene is well evident here. The climbing frame that sees one crow arrive, cutaway as Melanie smokes on a bench, back to the frame and now it's four crows, cutaway, back, and five crows \u2013 eight \u2013 then a \"murder of crows\". The birds first attack at the birthday party, the telephone kiosk, gas station mayhem, the birds swooping into view above the school roof and the POV viewpoint as we join a bird hovering above a town under siege, all great scenes, as is the crowning glory that is the eerie silence that accompanies the edge of your seat finale.\r\n\r\nMotifs are plentiful, from Mothers to sexuality, from broken crockery - to glass - to abandonment fears, Hitch has fun, especially with the human interactions, or lack of in certain scenes. It's a film that cries out for analysis, such is the director's want, in turn it's a riveting horror picture and a crafty enigma. It sounded daft as a basic idea for a film, and some must have thought Hitchcock had missed the boat of the creature feature boom of the 50s. Yet \"The Birds\" stands tall and proud as a damn fine piece of film from a true maestro of his craft, one of his last true classics and still today, over 50 years after its release, the film provokes theory discussion and visual terror in equal measure. 9/10", "Certainly has some creepy imagery and the acting was mostly passable, and I guess it works as a B-movie horror-thriller, but I never really found the birds all that terrifying. Probably the lower end of the Hitchcock movies I've seen. **3.25/5**", "Terrific horror film! Terrific film! But my impression is that The Birds is not really about the birds. To me this movie is all about the characters, their stories and finding something they didn't expect to find in each others. They felt real to me, they evolved and changed alongside their relationship with each others. In the end, even though they are going through hell, they managed to find some closure."], ["Nifty remake of the 1958 classic. This story of a shapeless, featureless space alien, instead of the usual \"little green men\", opens the door for a decidedly different kind of invasion movie. This version stays pretty true to the original and the advancement of special effects over 30 years allows for some really great and gory kills. The best being a victim being pulled into a sink drain and a wicked attack of a main character in a doctor's office.\r\n\r\nThere are some effects that aren't so good though, you'll scoff when you see them. The acting is really very good, and it's got its share of moments that are actually scary. The characters, even the primaries, could get swallowed up at any time. I'd say this is a must watch for any fan of the original."], ["Grave robbing is one thing, but murder is quite another.\r\n\r\nDr. MacFarlane and John Gray share a murky past, but just what is this hold that the lurching Gray has over the eminent Doctor?. Based on a Robert Louis Stevenson short story, The Body Snatcher contains tight direction from Mr Versatile, Robert Wise - all the classy Gothicism one comes to expect from producer Val Lewton - and a stunningly effective performance from Boris Karloff. The piece neatly puts itself out as a kind of sequel to the infamous story of Burke & Hare, where here our main protagonists are clouded over by a link to the dastardly duo who purloined cadavers for cash in the 1820s.\r\n\r\nWhat stands out with this picture is the wonderful pacing, nothing is rushed to try and jolt fear into the viewer, it's sedate and framed in a marvellous Gothic texture by the makers. The core story line is of course one of great distaste, but this is a medical quandary in the name of research that makes for a thought provoking narrative. We are put into a position very early on where we so want to see a young girl cured of her ills, and thus this axis of the film is neatly surrounded by the lurking horror that begins to unfold. You have to suggest that this is great writing from Stevenson, Lewton & MacDonald.\r\n\r\nBoris Karloff is Gray, a large shuffling man who is the body snatcher of the title, he be a smirking and well spoken Gent, which really shouldn't be scary, and yet Karloff manages to chill the blood in every scene that he is in. Henry Daniell is MacFarlane, a very emotive performance as the character is twisted by his pursuit of medical achievements whilst having Gray's looming presence constantly hovering over him. Rounding out the cast with thespian effect is Russell Wade as prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in waiting, Donald Fettes, Bela Lugosi (a classic horror fans dream comes real in one great sequence with Karloff) as Joseph, and Edith Atwater as loyal love interest Meg Camden.\r\n\r\nHowever, the actors all play second fiddle to the makers' work here. Gloomy cobbled streets come shining to the fore, Gray's hovel like abode is cloaked in dark shadows with the odd flicker of fire light, while the stone surrounds come across as monolithic structures. Some great sequences as well, a particular one uses the characters' shadows to tell the story under the watchful gaze of Gray's cat, and then the final reel, which is mood personified and perfectly puts closure on this fine piece of fevered Gothic work. Highly recommended. 8/10"], [], ["Carrie had been included on a list of great films to which my mother had taken my older brother and me to see upon their theatrical releases decades ago.

She is greeted with open arms and taken on a tour of what she hopes will become her new home. This is when she encounters the shy \"Carlita\" (Nicole Sorace) who spends much of her time in solitude drawing. This intrigues \"Margaret\" but not as much as some of the other goings on in the maternity ward of the hospital. Her concerns are only exacerbated by a meeting with \"Fr. Brennan\" (Ralph Ineson) who spins her an horrific yarn that makes her head spin and sets her on a detection task that reveals a conspiracy to end all conspiracies - one that is conceived by the church for it's own perpetuation, but that could bring down both it and mankind. At times it's quite a decently paced watch, this, with a little gruesomeness (isn't it odd that the tools of medicine so often look like those of torture?) but given we have known the denouement since 1976 the lack of any real jeopardy does rather rob the film of much of a sense of menace and what \"jump moments\" there are are all a bit predictable. Free does try to imbue her character with a bit of passion, and she manages along well enough but Nighy is weak and the single appearance from Charles Dance adds nothing at all to these lacklustre proceedings. Prequels are always hard to deliver. This tries, but sadly we've seen it all before and I fear the nun theme is beginning to self-flagellate itself to death.

Its intricate story, which chillingly displaced a sense of normalcy with a ever growing  horror and otherworldly menace, was truly compelling. \r\n\r\nBy contrast. The First Omen lacks true progression and originality. For well over half the film, it is, in fact, rather dull. It does make vain attempts to utilises tropes and events of the earlier films but fails to develop a measurably meaningful, original narrative, to accompany them. Moreover, as other reviewers have stated, quite correctly, in my view, its safe ending does little to mitigate the overriding sense of cinematic malaise.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if you have never experienced the Omen franchise, don't start with this film.

Why are we here? Does love exist since it cannot be proved via pure logic? Who is the Creator? The core message is the intrinsic need to seek one's Creator and reconcile in order to attain a (necessary) higher level of consciousness. Those found the film boring simply failed to penetrate beyond the surface.\r\n\r\nLike the Star Trek episodes \"The Corbomite Maneuver\" and \"Metamorphosis,\" \u201cThe Motion Picture\" (TMP) is a mature, cerebral sci-fi story with very little action. Most kids and young adults won't like it or grasp it. It's depth is evidenced by the emotional wallop experienced when Spock grasps Kirk's hand in Sickbay, truly revealing emotion despite his conflicting desire to attain a consciousness of pure logic; or later when Spock weeps for V'ger and comments on its personal dilemma, which perfectly coincides with Spock's own search for fulfillment: \"As I was when I came aboard, so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete and searching. Logic and knowledge are not enough... Each of us at some time in our lives turns to someone \u2014 a father, a brother, a God \u2014 and asks, 'Why am I here?' 'What was I meant to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its creator to find its answers.\"\r\n\r\nAnother powerful sequence is a crewman's self-sacrificial fusion with V'ger so that it may evolve to the next level of awareness (seemingly self-sacrificial, that is).\r\n\r\nMy conclusion on the film runs parallel to Roger Ebert's comments: \"My inclination, as I slid down in my seat and the stereo sound surrounded me, was to relax and let the movie give me a good time. I did and it did.\" In other words, just accept the film as is, and you WILL be entertained ; put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, lol), kick back and relish the movie magic.\r\n\r\nLet me add that TMP was one of the most expensive films of its time, but it did well at the box office and thus made a decent profit, a testimony to how hungry the public was for Star Trek after ten long years (since the cancellation of the original TV series in '69). In fact, aside from \"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\" (1986), TMP is still the most profitable of all the Star Trek feature films with the whole original cast (Making FOUR TIMES its expense worldwide); it therefore can't very well be the cinematic turd that many critics claim. Also, consider the fact that TMP made more at the box office than the acclaimed films \"Alien\" and \"Apocalypse Now,\" both released the same year.\r\n\r\nI should add that, although this film is an \"Grade A\" picture as far as epic, awe-inspiring pieces of cinematic art go, I understand why some would grade it lower. In such cases I suggest making the necessary psychological adjustments and watching it again as it is more along the lines of \"The Cage\" than \"The Doomsday Machine.\u201d \r\n\r\nTMP is the sole Star Trek film that aspires to and attains a level of cinematic awe along the lines of \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" Actually, TMP is leagues better IMHO. \"2001\" lacks characters to care about; it's also cold and overly artsy, with way too many unnecessarily boring sequences. TMP, by contrast, has heart. Not to mention an interesting story that delves into the deepest of all universal questions.\r\n\r\nSay what you will, but \"The Motion Picture\" towers alone, utterly unique in the feature film series \u2014 a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A", "BORING.\r\n\r\nI mean, it opens great.

The characterisations are roughly the same, if somewhat older - and that does help give it some cohesion; but the opening scene goes on interminably.

Persis Khambatta who plays \"Ilia\" - the conduit between the all powerful alien power and our gang of intrepid adventurers - is almost robotic and sterile; as is the general plot of the film.

Unfortunately it's become law in Trekdom to pick apart this film as a turkey of astronomical proportions; consequently a sort of bandwagon phenomenon has developed amongst the cookie-cutter fundamentalist Trekkers who have somehow failed to evolve to the level of independent thought. (They're no doubt still mad at Shatner for telling them to \"get a life\"). In fact, it's become such a clich\u00e9 to hate \"Star Trek V\" that it has become the \"Spock's Brain\" of the feature films.\r\n\r\nI disagree. While \"The Final Frontier\" certainly has its share of flaws -- the story goes over the edge into the realm of goofy camp at times and some argue that the F/X are possibly the least of the feature films -- it remains an entertaining picture. Besides, Star Trek was never about great special effects (disregarding the triumphant \"The Motion Picture\"). It's about people, their joy of living and their grand spirit of exploration; this is what \"The Final Frontier\" is all about and it scores high marks in this regard.\r\n\r\nNo other Trek film showcases the character interplay of the Kirk/Spock/McCoy troika to the level of intimacy shown in \"The Final Frontier,\" and only \"The Voyage Home\" exceeds the joyful energy of the characters displayed here. As far as the spirit of exploration goes, \"Star Trek V\" surpasses all other Trek adventures; after all, no exploration is greater than the quest for ultimate reality and the Creator of all. It touches on many important themes: personal pain, healing, faith, family, love, fanaticism, the desire to know ultimate reality, God, false beliefs, loyalty, repentance and forgiveness. Name another film in the series that addresses so many weighty topics and yet remains entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe film was actually doomed with critics and Trekker fundamentalists the moment it was disclosed that Shatner would direct it; the knives hit the sharpening stones well before it was ever released and once the buzz got out that it was a bad film a feeding frenzy ensued. It would have been better received if Shatner had directed the film anonymously and if it were released after \"Star Trek III.\" As it was, it came out on the heels of \"Star Trek IV,\" arguably the pinnacle of the feature films. If \"The Wrath of Khan\" had come out after The Voyage Home it would have been deemed a mediocre affair.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that \"Star Trek V\" is a solid and extremely original Trek outing, equal parts amusing, thought-provoking, wonder-inducing and heart-warming; it possesses a wealth of quality scenes and has an interesting assortment of colorful characters who unite together for the ultimate discovery. \r\n\r\nIts best character is Sybok, played excellently by Laurence Luckinbill. Sybok isn't really a villain at all, but rather a rebel Vulcan who rejects Stoicism and develops a compulsion to heal people and find ultimate knowledge. His mistake is allowing this compulsion to assume the creature beyond the Great Barrier is God, which it obviously isn't. Of course the film would have been more successful if the studio hadn't repeatedly cut the budget the closer the it came to completion, thus robbing Shatner (and us) of his original vision. As it is, the climax is serviceable, but also missing something.\r\n\r\nRegardless, \"The Final Frontier\" is an entertaining Trek romp, if nothing else. Thankfully it offers much more. Personally, I'd view it in any day before \"The Wrath of Khan.\" By all means, watch it again for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "I know, I know, I know, please don't hate me.

Not the ones I shared with my father, but MY Star Trek.\r\n\r\nAnd now when I watch it, yeah, I realize how bad it is, but it sort of has that landmark feeling of being my own Star Trek film... so I can't give it the horrible rating it deserves.\r\n\r\nBut... yeah, I know it sucks.", "Starts off promisingly, but descends quickly into a somewhat outlandish tale as the crew of the Enterprise meet up with the half brother of \"Spock\".

Of course there is scope for a discussion on a more ethical approach to the universe and our place in it; but \"Star Trek\" movies are just not that place - and I am afraid the story just glugs along like a rhino stuck in a puddle of treacle.

And me being a hopeless Donna Summer fanatic, naturally I'd wanted to see \"TGIF\" too, but it had to be Grease, first, because our tix were purchased in advance ... And also because we were only committed to one movie at a time...sometimes. \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\nI was glad, however, that we got to see Grease, because I was in love with this film by the time it ended. It was one of my most cherished childhood experiences/memories. And I still hold it dear today.\r\n\r\nThis Randal Kleiser directed musical was one of the greatest cinematic oeuvres of its time - even today, undergoing readaptations for the stage, and entertaining both past and present generations. In Grease, the film, John Travolta (my guy) and Olivia Newton-John (my girl) star as Danny and Sandy, who meet one summer at the beach and fall madly in love. However, there's one problem: Danny is a local fella (and a 'T-birds greaser gang member'), while Sandy (pure and clean-cut from Australia) is only in town vacationing for the summer. When the summer ends, their newfound (and passionate) relationship may also have to. But will it?...\r\n\r\nSet in 1950s California, Grease is a motion picture for the Hollywood history books. It is tremendously directed, with a beautifully-composed soundtrack. And the cast? Well, what can you say when you have a gifted supporting ensemble of some of the best in their respective crafts: Stockard Channing, Frankie Avalon, Eve Arden, Joan Blondell, Sha-Na-Na, Sid Ceasar, and Alice Ghostley, among a talented bundle of others.\r\n\r\nGrease is one of my all-time favorites. The story is grade A, and so are the legendary performances, as is the equally fabled soundtrack to which it is set. I love this movie, and highly recommend it to everyone ...

She ends up going to the same high school as he, but he's under peer pressure to stay cool and uphold a tough guy image. They fall out, argue, make up, their friends are equally unstable. Oh and there's the small matter of some truly memorable songs and dances too.\r\n\r\nAs full of gusto as it is cheese, Grease is the musical that's hard to dislike. The acting is so-so, the direction one dimensional and the plot could have been written on a 50s beer mat. Yet we love it because of its faults, the kooky charm that sidles up alongside those roaring tunes. We care not that these actors are too old to play high schoolers, the fun is watching them have fun being teens again. Hell there's even innuendo unbound and cheeky lyrics for those of an adult mind. A truly great fun movie that's longevity shows no time of ending any time soon.

This is of course a classic and I cannot name one person who does know at least one song from it. \r\n\r\nSo, deep in your brain somewhere, you\u2019re probably aware generally of what this is about, but here is the official description:\r\n\r\n_Good girl Sandy Olsson and greaser Danny Zuko fell in love over the summer. When they unexpectedly discover they're now in the same high school, will they be able to rekindle their romance?_\r\n\r\nMade in 1978 but set in 1958 this is a whole lot of toe tapping fun. Almost all of the songs are instantly recognisable, and although I will never admit it, I may or may not have slid across our kitchen tiles on my knees after watching it, yelling \u201cit\u2019s ELECTRIFYING\u201d. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s interesting watching this now is how lewd this is. So much of this went way over my head when watching this as a kid. Condoms breaking, calling cars pussy wagons, singing about chicks creaming and swimsuits getting damp, I forgot how much double entendre and innuendo there is in the song lyrics and the movie as a whole.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting is the theory of how Sandy in fact died on the beach in the opening scene and that the rest of the film is the dying, oxygen starved fantasy of her brain. Think about it - in the song \u201cSummer Nights\u201d from Sandy\u2019s point of view, Danny says that when he met Sandy, \u201cI saved her life; she nearly drowned.\u201d What if I told you that, in reality, she _did_ drown hence why on the beach Sandy, as she enters the alternate plane asks him \u201cIs this the end?\u201d He replies, \u201cOf course not. It\u2019s only the beginning.\u201d She then has the dying brain fantasy of a year of high school romance with Danny, the visions get more and more outlandish as the time passes, before, at the climax of the movie she and Danny drive off in a car that leaves the ground and drives off into heaven, in what we can only speculate are her final moments. \r\n\r\nAnyway that\u2019s something to think about next time you watch it.

It's a classic, everyone in the world knows this movie.", "\"Sandy\" (Olivia Newton John) is a well brought up young girl who meets and falls in love with \"Danny\" (John Travolta) during summer break in late 1950's California. When they both start high school, though, we discover she to be the archetypical preppie-type who hangs about with Stockard Channing's \"Pink Ladies\" and he the leader of the \"T-Birds\" - the school's leather and white T-shirt clad greasers. Their obvious attraction to each other is hemmed in by their respective roles at school and they've got to find a way to sort it out! Channing is the star for me in this film. She's great as \"Rizzo\" - loads of attitude, earthy wisdom and \"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\" - that helps \"Sandy\" to hook her man. Along with some entertainingly well choreographed dance routines, the other songs are superb too - a mixture of toe tappers and sloppy ballads from the likes of Frankie Valli, Frankie Avalon and of course, the two stars with \"You're the One That I Want\" and \"Summer Nights\" that frequently outdo the rather banal script.

'Jaws 2' puts high focus on the teenagers, though their story never possesses any intrigue. The effects for the shark, meanwhile, are a step down from the original.\r\n\r\nIt's not terribly far from being watchable, a slightly shorter run time might've helped in that regard, but I just personally found it to be an uninteresting 115 minutes or so. Perhaps initial director John D. Hancock's ideas would've came out better, though he was fired during production; speaking of which, the issues behind the scenes for this - and even the first film, really - are pretty fascinating.", "It's only after watching this that you realise just how crucial to the success of the first film Robert Shaw was. This is not the worst sequel I've seen by any means, but without his gnarled and charismatic \"Quint\", we are left with a pretty mundane effort from all concerned. This time our hungry finned friend has a group of young sailors - including, of course, the Brady bunch - \"Michael\" (Mark Gruner) and \"Sean\" (Marc Gilpin) firmly in it's sights. This necessitates their sheriff father (Roy Scheider) having to defy his own loathing of the water to try and rescue them. Director Jeannot Szwarc tries to mix it up a little, but there is just too much inevitability about the ending; and the screaming hysterics of the weans - especially the truly irritating \"Jackie\" (Donna Wilkes) started to get under my finger nails quite quickly. The photography is good, and some effort has been made to disguise the more mechanical elements of the shark attacks, but the calamitous fire pan to fire scenarios recycle themselves once too often. John Williams' score still works well to help generate some semblance of a sense of peril, but I'm afraid this isn't remotely scary and was quite a disappointing watch."], ["**When in doubt - point a long stick toward the screen**\r\n\r\nThese 3D ventures are amusing. Whenever the plot slows down a cast member randomly picks up a long stick and points it at the camera.\r\n\r\nThis film is no exception. Whenever the plot crawls to snails pace characters start pointing long sticks at the camera for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\nDoing most of the long stick pointing here is Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong - she needs a _strong arm_ to pick random objects up and point them toward the camera as often as she does.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Potential Kermode", "Yeah... not good. I don't dislike <em>'Jaws 3-D'</em> as much as most evidently do, though.\r\n\r\nDennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong are actually pleasant in terms of the cast, none of those behind them are anything worth noting but are somewhat serviceable. I will say I didn't enjoy the plot, but only because it lacked something worth watching - it's poor, not terrible. More of the shark was wanted, but I would personally say that about the preceding two films as well.\r\n\r\nParts of this 1983 flick that are terrible, though, are the special effects, especially right at the end. There is also some poorly done green screen and it, clearly, has a dire cover. There's no doubting this being made was a cash grab, that's basically the only reason to ever go 3-D, but a cash grab doesn't necessarily mean it's an awful film; which this isn't, in my opinion. It's simply bad.

Anyway, he works at a newly opened sea world where a baby great white finds it's way in for a quick snack through a broken seagate. Where's mama, though? She can't be far away! The baby shark is captured, but swiftly dies and it is as if the big one knows, and let's just say she is seriously narked. Aside from some decent underwater photography, and some talented folks doing water-batics, it's a dreadful stain on the reputation of the franchise. The opening titles offer a clue to the 3-D effects, and I do recall sitting in the Odeon in Glasgow with my cardboard glasses on wondering what all the fuss was about 40 years ago.

Still, the story (basically a James Bond-type role, as he is forced by his boss to help the CIA prevent a Russian nuclear device from getting into the wrong hands) stands on its own, and is thrilling from start to finish, though something tends to be different and missing from his earlier Hong Kong exploits (though this was made there and dubbed--albeit horrendously--to help make him a star Stateside). If I had to put a finger on it, I think I prefer films that Chan directed himself. It's still extremely enjoyable, with set-pieces--especially when he defends himself with a stepladder--that approach awe-inspiring choreographed action perfection..."], ["I forgot how funny this movie is. I used to watch this all the time. Still as funny now as it was back then."], ["**After two films with a lot of good things, this film shows signs of fatigue and wear.**\r\n\r\nIf I can say that I really enjoyed the first film in this trilogy, I can't say the same for any of the sequels. The first film, even with all the flaws, was quite good and was so enjoyable that it became a milestone for many people's childhood and adolescence. The second film managed to retain many of the first's qualities, but lacked a credible and intelligent script. This film, in turn, is not able to learn from the mistakes of its predecessor and ends up sounding like more of the same, in a tired and worn recipe.\r\n\r\nThe action of the film takes place several years after the second and first. If for Jesse time passed, for Willy time would pass even faster, since these animals usually have an average lifespan of twenty to twenty-five years in human age. So, if Willy would still be young in the first film, in this film he would be a much more mature animal, and the probability of being able to answer his old partner's call of circus skills would be, to say the least, a house-sized absurdity.\r\n\r\nEven so, the script brings the two together again, and this time to face an illegal whaling ship willing to hunt as many orcas as it can, to make good money with them. Keeping what we've been used to since the beginning, the film seeks to raise public awareness of important issues for the preservation of marine life, and this time nothing seems better than showing the cruelty of illegal hunting of whales and other cetaceans. However, the weakness of the film itself somewhat undermines such noble intentions, and I have no doubt that the Chinese would abhor the idea, given that China is one of the rare countries that still sanctions the hunting of these animals.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that the film has lost all the freshness and shine of the first two, and that we also do not have a quality direction that knows how to squeeze the few qualities that still remain in the franchise. And although the villains are quite impressive, the film is predictable, all the material is tired and does not hold our attention. The film is saved, \u201cin extremis\u201d, by the fast pace and by the fact that it doesn't take long to finish.\r\n\r\nBack to the usual characters, Jason James Ritcher and August Schellenberg return to be present, but if Ritcher still manages reasonably with the task, Schellenberg seems a shadow of what he was in the previous films, even if it is a return that is more than positive and well-received. coming. With the rest of the previous cast declining the chance of returning, we are left with the positive and interesting addition of Patrick Kalpatrick, who offers us a very satisfactory job. Vincent Berry also deserves a good grade, but there's not much for him to do, really.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film continues to bet on good cinematography and the choice of beautiful filming locations. As with its predecessor, it's a film that doesn't look its age: if you watch it without knowing when it was made, you don't give it more than ten years. Good sound effects, good special effects and a realistic animatronic whale are some of the values that the film presents to us. The soundtrack is pleasant, but it's a recycling of previous material."], ["Wow, this was a pretty fair movie wasn't it? And it came from Oliver Stone. One would almost expect it to be a paranoid mess, but it was done pretty well.\r\n\r\nHopkins did a great job too... except maybe looking a little too old for the role, but he captured a lot of Nixon's mannerisms, a lot of how he spoke and moved. It was far from uncanny, but he really did nail the essence of the character and that is almost better than cloning him.\r\n\r\nJoan Allen fails though. She doesn't exactly ape Pat as well as she could and you are left with the impression that she doesn't understand who she was depicting.\r\n\r\nAnd then you have little hints at the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories and, even though I supported them, I don't think that they had a place in a movie about Nixon. They felt alien and X-Files and you are left doubting that said conversation ever took place.\r\n\r\nAside from all of that, though, this seems like a great film that was fairly done, about someone that it would have been far too easy to stereotype as a drooling monster. Stone humanized him, and that took heart and talent."], [], [], ["**A set of stories, more than a story made up of stories.**\r\n\r\nThis film reminded me, in a certain way, of a polite version of \u201cClerks\u201d, an unorthodox comedy where everything revolves around a convenience store, a video club and two employees from those same stores. Here, everything revolves around Auggie Wren's tobacconist, who takes a picture of the shop every day, at the same time. In one of them, by chance, the deceased wife of one of the store's customers appears who, after being saved from being run over by a boy, decides to help him.\r\n\r\nThe film is discreet, does not have great cinematography resources, nor visuals. Everything here revolves around the characters, their individual stories, the way they intersect and interconnect. The script is very important for the film, but the work of the actors cannot be overlooked either. Harvey Keitel does a very worthy and well-executed job, and William Hurt, Harold Perrineau and Forest Whitaker follow him closely, so we have a good cast working hard. The big problem with this movie is that it really doesn't have much more to offer. For those who like films that are very much based on characters, their behavior, their stories, and well-written dialogues, the film is wonderful. For anyone hoping this all boils down to a story that is more than a set of stories, the film may be disappointing."], [], [], [], ["Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend if you've seen any other version or are looking for a writing analysis.\r\n\r\nDuring a lot of the movie, I was kind of in nostalgia mode, remember things I saw / felt when I was a kid, just sort of enjoying the way back machine experience.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until almost the very last scene that it clicked how good the writing is in this.  I know this is known for the excellent animation styling, the catchy tunes, and charming coming of age semantics, but this uses several strong formulas that have been used since Aesop's fables.\r\n\r\nAnd that's what made me realize the writing quality, I felt as if I was watching an on fable with moral lessons of consequence.

While Tarzan makes more sense, this is character development for the series of situations (each one their own potential fable) with the main character shifting to and fro from Bagera to Mowgli to Balloo, each one being taught lessons as the adventure continues.\r\n\r\nWith the representation of the jungle and the adversities that Mowgli faces, Mowgli slowly learns what Bagera and Baloo both know: most people are only interested in their own interests, but sometimes those that have enough can be in a position to help others.  The xenoism (racism) that Sher Khan has for Mowgli as a human is enough for these predators give up his companionship to help him to the man-village.\r\n\r\nThe really odd lesson is that Mowgli embraces the self-interest needed in the jungle, despite dialogue to the contrary."], ["A bit dated looking at it over 20 years later, but still entertaining.  A slick neo-noir that helped revive the genre.", "All Roads Lead To Intrigue.\r\n\r\nRed Rock West is directed by John Dahl who also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Rick. It stars Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, J. T. Walsh and Timothy Carhart. Music is by William Olvis and cinematography by Marc Reshovsky. \r\n\r\nWhen a promised job in Wyoming fails to materialise on account of an injury sustained in combat, Michael Williams (Cage) drifts into the town of Red Rock and is mistaken in a bar for a hit-man hired to kill an unfaithful wife. Tempted by the high cash on offer, Michael plays along and promptly finds himself in a web of intrigue from which escape is looking unlikely\u0085 \r\n\r\nWelcome To Red Rock/You Are Now Leaving Red Rock. \r\n\r\nThe studio didn't know what to do with it, a neo-noir flavoured with contemporary Western spices. Put out on cable in America and thriving on its limited release in Europe, it started to gain a cult fan-base. More so after a theatre in the Frisco Bay area started showing it and it made considerable coinage. Today it still remains more of a cult piece than anything else, which while it deserves more accolades and exposure, is still kind of nice for the fans, because it's like we have our own little neo-noir treasure all to ourselves. \r\n\r\nRed Rock West is essential for the neo-noir heads and well worthy of inspection by the average modern day crime film fan. Plot wise it's a bit, shall we say iffy? Yet the twists, turns and characterisations are so deftly constructed and performed, it matters not a jot. Cage's ex- marine is an honest and decent guy who whilst down on his luck - punished for his honesty - finds himself in a vortex of mystery and murder that he can't escape from. His companions in this scenario are film noir staples, the femme fatale (Boyle) with a smoulder as big as her secret, the hit-man (Hopper) with a glint in his eye to accompany his callous leanings, and the shifty bar owner (Walsh) trying to off his wife whilst keeping his shady cards close to his chest. \r\n\r\nAs the tricksy plot unfolds in a haze of bad judgements and untruths, further pulsed by the vagaries of fate, it becomes apparent that Dahl wants us to know it isn't taking itself too seriously. There's a glorious scent of dark humour hanging in the air, an unpretentiousness about the whole thing that's refreshing. The look and feel is perfect for the narrative, the colour is stripped back to create a moody atmospheric surround, while the score and sound-tracking immediately brings to mind country and western tales of woe. Dahl knows his noir onions, but this is not just a homage hat tipper to the past, he understands what works in noir, be it the blending of the quirky with the edgy, or scene setting in locales such as a colourless bar and a foggy cemetery, Dahl gets the key ingredients right to deliver the goods wholesale. \r\n\r\nThe small cast come up trumps. Boyle as Suzanne Brown is weak if her femme fatale is pitted against the likes of Matty Walker or Bridget Gregory, but it's an adequate performance that doesn't hinder the picture. She is helped enormously, though, by having to share most scenes with Cage who brings his \"A\" game. Consistently inconsistent throughout his career, Cage, when on form is a joy to watch, here he gets to thrive as a put upon hero, shifting seamlessly between confusion and boldness, where incredulous looks are the order of the day with a side order of eccentric intensity. Hopper does what he does so well, amusing villainy, while Walsh is effortlessly menacing and suspicious. In small secondary support Carhart and country star Dwight Yoakam leave favourable impressions. \r\n\r\nThis is not an edge of your seat thriller, or a cranium bothering piece of dramedy, it's neo-noir done right.

Is it even Altman's best work? Well, everything unique and original in the other movies on this list was done before... by Altman. (Is there anything the man hasn't tried?) And everything Altman achieved in his career can be summed up in _Short Cuts_.\r\n\r\nFive of the entries on my list are genre intact: gangster, war, bio, sci-fi, adventure. Lynch is a genre of his own (a master of hook and subvert), _Pulp Fiction_ is pomo-noir with a swagger, _Tree of Life_, an audacious and transcendent poem, _Boyhood_, literally an epic achievement of dedication and commitment. _Short Cuts_ doesn't seem to fit in as it is merely an observation of lives and love. But what observations! What lives! What heartbreaking affection. All underscored with a resonating heartbeat patching into so many paths, teetering on the brink of disaster and threatening to explode, which it does, in the form of a climactic planetary stroke. Nothing brings people together quite like a natural disaster. An earthquake, tremoring just enough to inform us of our place in history on the cosmic map. Enough to bring us down to earth, reboot our egos, and put multiple perspectives in perspective. Enough to appreciate the simple state of being. \r\n\r\nA larger-than-life baroque master is at the helm, warbling out contrapuntal narratives and swirling themes orchestrated to perfection. Multiple story-lines wavering under one very singular umbrella. And under Altman's protective cover the talent runs free and easy, playful and experimental, ironic and sincere. The key characters in one story become walk-throughs in another, paradoxically tethered and disconnected from the self, from family, community, and life. Boundaries are crossed and souls get lost. We're all the same if only by not knowing what our needs are or why we're even here. With nothing to say except everything is exceptional, infinite and empty. And life is short. Shorts Cuts of scenes stories words actions desire love loss lies lust faith wonder and devotion.

It's a recurring problem in cinema. This film, however, makes the opposite mistake: the script is excessive, it has so many characters and so many interconnected sub-plots that it is almost necessary to make diagrams and schemes on a board to be able to follow what is happening. I got almost halfway through the movie and I didn't really know who was who.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with a fleet of helicopters spraying something over the skies of Los Angeles. I, who was very young when the film was made, had to do some research to realize what they're doing: spraying an insecticide to fight flies, something I had never seen in the middle of a city. Then the film begins to introduce us to a multitude of characters and their everyday stories: we have several middle-class couples, each with the problems of their lives, we have a limousine driver married to a cafeteria worker, the pilot from one of the helicopters, an erotic line operator who has a husband and children\u2026 and we follow the daily problems of these couples and families. The film tries to give us a portrait of ordinary people and their lives, but it does so in an excessively dispassionate and uncompromising way, failing to convey the emotions of the characters, with whom we have no particular connection. The only sub-plot that tries to go through the most emotional way (that of the child) turns out to be so melodramatic that it loses credibility.\r\n\r\nTechnically, this film is low-key and doesn't bet too much on anything flashy. The cinematography is the standard used at that time, the special effects and visuals work reasonably, but not surprisingly, the sets and costumes are regular. The editing work was well done, but the film, with its three hours long, becomes a little tiring, mainly due to our inability to truly connect with the characters and what we see in the film.\r\n\r\nWhat saves this film, in a decisive way, is the enormous cast of great actors, and the way in which each one, in a very individual way, does an excellent dramatic work. The film, in fact, looks like a showcase of the best Hollywood had in the early 90s. Bruce Davison, Fred Ward, Lily Tomlin, Tom Waits, Anne Archer, Andie MacDowell, Chris Penn, Robert Downey Jr., Lily Taylor, Madeleine Stowe, Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Julianne Moore, Peter Gallagher, Matthew Modine, Frances McDormand\u2026 say a name, and he's there! Each one in their role, each one trying to do the best, but each one for themselves. The film works very well as a dramatic exercise and allows each actor to show the best that he knows how to do. Even so, it lacks emotion, lacks commitment, lacks intensity."], ["Hollywood once again retells the story of the legendary lawman, this time in the guise of Kurt Russell. Add Val Kilmer, Sam Neill, and Bill Paxton into the mix and what you get doesn't exactly scream \"A list\" but what you do have is an ensemble cast that gels particularly well; this is one of those films that manages to be more than the sum of its parts. The bond of brotherhood and friendship between the Earps and Doc Holliday feels genuine and Kilmer clearly relishes the scene stealing part of sickly gentleman adrenaline junkie Holliday. Powers Booth and Michael Biehn also make charismatic villains, the scenes between Biehn and Kilmer being particularly sharp and the Peckinpah shoot outs extremely well staged. In fact the shoot out at the OK corral is one of the best versions yet filmed. It does occasionally slip into melodrama (Morgan's death being the prime example) and the climax is a little montage happy and feels a little rushed as a result, but it's a great slice of old school popular entertainment that's a lot more engaging than Kevin Costner's pompous yawn-fest released the same year.", "Indeed, sir. The last charge of Wyatt Earp and his immortals. \r\n\r\nTombstone is written by Kevin Jarre and directed by its star Kurt Russell, with credited director George P. Cosmatos ghost-directing. It also features a large ensemble cast that includes Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn & Powers Boothe. The movie is loosely based on historic incidents occurring in 1881-1882. The plot follows newly retired peace officer Wyatt Earp (Russell) as he and his two brothers, Virgil (Elliott) & Morgan (Paxton), arrive in the Tuscon town of Tombstone. Here they plan to make their fortune and gain themselves a share in a farrow game at the local saloon. Wyatt's long time friend, Doc Holliday (Kilmer), also joins the Earp's in town and it's not long before they encounter trouble in the form of The Cowboys - a ruthless bunch of outlaws led by Curly Bill Brocious (Boothe).\r\n\r\nThe back story to Tombstone is rather interesting, so without waffling on and boring the spurs off of any readers I'll try & keep this paragraph short! Willem Dafoe was slated to star as Doc Holliday but Buena Vista (Disney company) said no way on account of his appearance in the frowned upon The Last Temptation Of Christ. Since Buena Vista were the only company willing to distribute Tombstone, on account of Kevin Costner pulling rank and influence due to his own Wyatt Earp movie being on the go, they had the big say in things. Then when the screenplay was turned in by Jarre it was shot down by both Russell and the now on board Kilmer because it was deemed excessively too long. Jarre was then fired as director for refusing to cut down the characterisations. Enter Cosmatos to ghost-direct for Russell. Then Robert Mitchum (who narrates in the film) had to drop out of playing Old Man Clanton (subsequently dropped from the story) due to a riding accident. While genre legend Glenn Ford bailed out of playing Marshall White to pave the way for Harry Carey Junior to fill those boots.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the problems getting harmony and cohesion to the screen, Tombstone ends up being a thoroughly entertaining genre piece. A love letter to the genre and boasting one of the best ever portrayals of an (in)famous Western character (Kilmer's take on Holliday is sexy, dangerous and utterly beguiling). Comparing it to Costner's movie is folly, for that movie (and I'm a big fan of it) is a telling of Earp's life and doesn't Hollywoodise things, this is about a short period in Earp's life, with bells on. There's some inaccuracies, but in the main the makers do a good job of covering the events leading up to the famous gunfight that occurred at the O.K. Corall - and the aftermath of said confrontation. Pic manages to have its cake and to eat it for a modern age made Western. It does all in all what old fans of the genre expect whilst having enough savvy dialogue and rah rah sequences to engage the more youthful viewers. There's not much art to speak of (for instance you wont go searching out for the cinematographer's name) and the sheer volume of characters at times threatens to bulge the piece over the belt buckle. Yet it always manages to keep us entertained with a high energy action sequence or a sharp quip delivered by the irrepressible Kilmer. Even the standardised romantic angle involving the beautiful, but superfluous Dana Delaney as Josephine manages to have its engaging moments. Sure we ache for the next scene of Kilmer being cool or Biehn being a cocky bastard, but the love blossoming between Wyatt & Josephine, and the inner conflict that it causes Earp, really fleshes out where Earp was emotionally at a time when he was trying to settle down for peace in his world.\r\n\r\nUltimately it's probably with the story of Kilmer & Russell insisting on a trimming of the story that Tombstone makes the most telling point. Critically it was recognised as being too bloated and that wasn't what was needed. For crying out loud the Western fan had had Eastwood's sublime Unforgiven the previous year, so who in their right mind would try and follow that? Tombstone thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously, but still it has enough nous to keep the beans cooking on high and the splendid moustache's a twirling. All that Whilst simultaneously providing some of the most quotable lines delivered in the most splendid of film genres. Kilmer's Doc is our Huckleberry, and so is Tombstone the film. 8/10", "**A very well done western, which replaces glorification with raw realism.**\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed this film, which is very centered on the notable figures of Wyatt Earp, Virgil Earp, Morgan Earp and Doc Holiday during their time as law and order in the town of Tombstone. In popular culture, they became famous due to a short but intense exchange of fire with a group of gunmen from the city, called the Ok Corral Shooting. The incident, which took place in October 1881, was widely romanticized in the early 20th century and became a symbol of the Old West.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the shooting, which appears in this film, was just one violent incident within a long feud between the sheriffs and the gunmen. The causes are still shrouded in mists that historians are trying, with difficulty, to penetrate, and the feud continued and resulted in the murder of one of the Earp brothers and the pursuit and death of some of the assassins, in a veritable manhunt. I'm a historian, but I'm not an expert on the period or the Wild West, but I felt that the film managed to put everything in its context and respect, minimally, what really happened.\r\n\r\nIf there is something in this film that deserves to be highlighted, it is the work of the actors. We have a magnificent cast, full of very competent actors who committed themselves to their respective roles. The effort deserves our praise. Of course, Kurt Russel will have a special highlight when receiving the character of Wyatt Earp, but the actor made good use of that role and managed to be very charismatic and friendly to the public. Sam Elliott, one of those veterans with a lot of attitude and personality, couldn't be better and is incredibly good in this film. Maybe it's the actor's best film. Val Kilmer is not one of those actors that makes me want to see a movie, but the truth is that he was also very good at his job, and managed to harmonize his character's fragility and charisma well.\r\n\r\nDirected by Kevin Jarre and George Cosmatos, the film is one of those westerns that went against the classics by dismantling the glorified figure of the cowboy, the bravery and coldness of the gunslinger and the villain, and giving a more realistic and historically credible flavor to films of this genre. The script is very good, it is very well written, and the technical work of the visual effects, make-up, costumes and set design teams was truly exquisite. The cinematography does not let us down either and makes very clever use of all this, and the sets and exterior footage, with magnificent lighting and a warm color palette that is simply delightful. The soundtrack, despite not being memorable or worthy of particular attention, does a good job.", "There is something really quite authentic looking about this western. Set at a time when the law was beginning to seriously impose itself on the otherwise lawless \"wild\" west, it depicts the story of Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) who just wanted to retire to peace and quiet in the eponymous Arizona town. Once there, he quickly realises that his fellow townsfolk are not on the same page. The arrival of his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott), Morgan (Bill Paxton) and his lifelong friend \"Doc\" Holliday (Val Kilmer) make a confrontation with the red-sashed \"cowboys\" inevitable. This film takes it's time to develop the characters and the narrative. That's not say it is dull, it isn't - it just allows the story to breathe as the tension mounts before culminating in the legendary gunfight at the OK Corral. Russell was maybe not the best choice (though at times he reminded me of Gene Hackman); but Kilmer was oddly effective as was Stephen Lang's pretty duplicitous Ike Clanton. It's narrated by one Hollywood legend - Robert Mitchum, and features the briefest of cameos at the end from another - Charlton Heston, is well constructed and paced, and rather creatively, poignantly (and violently at times) depicts the end of an era."], ["What makes this film stand out (a little) is the intimate style of photography. The POV camerawork gives us a proximity to the story and characters that we rarely see. Sadly, though, the story itself is a little bit thin. Denzel Washington is tasked with investigating the worthiness of a deceased helicopter pilot during the Gulf war to receive the medal of honor. Assuming it would be a routine ratification, he interviews her crew only to find discrepancies and inconstancies that cast a shadow over the whole procedure. Had this just been a routine wartime tale, then it might have been ok - but the fact that it is based around a real wartime scenario, and married together with that sickly trumpet-based pseudo-military score and an annoyingly \"Semper Fi\" sort of mentality, the whole thing just sinks down into a mire of absurdity and sentimentality. Neither Denzel Washington nor Meg Ryan really have the weight to give this film any bite, oomph - or, for that matter, plausibility. Matt Damon makes some impact but I couldn't quite decide whether that was because he was good, or because it was interesting to see him before stardom set it in - but either way, this is pretty much devoid of action, and the dialogue could have been written by the US Army recruitment office. They all look great in their uniforms, though!"], ["**A good piece of family entertainment.**\r\n\r\nThis is one of those regular fantasy films that were a hit when they hit television during the 90s, becoming a fairly regular presence on weekend afternoons and holidays. Easily appealing to children and young people, it is a family film that entertains and moves.\r\n\r\nThe film is set in an uncertain period of the Middle Ages, in a legendary European kingdom where the young and cruel Einon reigns with an iron fist and no heart. As a teenager, his life had been saved by a dragon that gave him half of its own heart. Now, he ignores his master's lessons of honor and bravery, and rules like a tyrant. However, the population is fed up with his excesses and Bowen, the king's former tutor, decides to lead the revolt against him with the help of a dragon, the last one still alive, and precisely the one that saved the king.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to waste a lot of time on this film because it's far from being a relevant work for those involved, even though its popularity at the time was remarkable. There are many nice and well done things in this film, starting with the script. Yes, it's a cheesy story, it looks a lot like Robin Hood and other like that, it's full of clich\u00e9s and the humor is, to say the least, off-putting. But the truth is that it entertains and has enough fantasy and emotion to delight us. There are some good fight scenes, the castle attack sequence is exciting and intense, the special effects and the CGI (a new technology, at the time) used are quite worthy and do a very good job considering the time and resources. We also have excellent cinematography and a memorable soundtrack, truly epic, which was then used for a thousand and one uses, as we know.\r\n\r\nThe actors, despite not shining, make a credible effort and are reasonably committed. There are some well-known names here, starting with the dragon's voice, lent by the unmistakable Sir Sean Connery, in one of the best voice dubbing work done by him. Dennis Quaid was capable enough in the role of a mature hero, already not very young, but it is the quality of David Thewlis that surprises us and steals all the attention. The actor brought the perfidious King Einon to life in a truly remarkable way, with commitment and emotion, giving him touches of cynicism, sadism and madness. I have a very strong feeling that Thewlis drew his inspiration from Peter Ustinov's wonderful performance in \u201cQuo Vadis\u201d, in the role of Nero. Finally, Pete Postlethwaite seems to really enjoy the character he was lucky enough to play, a friendly monk with the air of a great troubadour.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I didn't like Dina Meyer at all: she doesn't make an effort for her character and the romantic chemistry with Quaid is absolutely nil. I also missed the contextualization, in time and space: as the film is pure fantasy, we don't even have the notion of a concrete place or time, in order to be able to copy clothes, technologies, architecture. Although the movie had good sets and costumes, I can't say that I really liked them because they were too fanciful."], ["A little light on story, though that stop-motion animation is noice.\r\n\r\nAt just under 1hr 20mins, <em>'James and the Giant Peach</em> is simply a pleasant to watch flick with a sweet story and excellent animation. Miriam Margolyes and Joanna Lumley as the aunts is great casting, while the voice cast all perform well.\r\n\r\nI like it enough, even with the ineffective singing bits. Overall, this 1996 release is, in my opinion, nothing great but nothing bad either."], ["Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film <i>Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove</i> is a hilarious film about the nuclear annihilation of the human race. Its plot combines three strands that lead inevitably to this doomsday. In the first, an Air Force base commander (Sterling Hayden) goes insane and launches the go-code for his B52s to drop the bomb on their targets in Russia, while a British captain on an officer exchange program (Peter Sellers) tries to reason with him. In the second strand, we see the crew of a B52 commanded by the cowboyish Major Kong (Slim Pickens) as they prepare to drop the bomb. Finally, there are the scenes from the Pentagon war room, where the American president (again Peter Sellers) harangues a general (George&nbsp;C. Scott) about how this could have happened, until the mysterious German scientist Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove (Peter Sellers yet again) offers a solution.\r\n\r\nOriginally meant to be a straightforward adaptation of a political thriller novel, <i>Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove</i> became a madcap comedy. The characters' sexual quirks, anti-Communist hysteria and nonchalance about the coming apocalypse and are exaggerated to the point of farce. No other Peter Sellers film shows off his range of talents so well: he segues effortlessly between Captain Mandrake, a nervous fellow with a British accident already antiquated at the time the film was made, the staid American politician President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove, one of the Nazi scientists that the USA brought over after World War&nbsp;II.\r\n\r\nFilmgoers must have perceived this film somewhat differently, when the threat of nuclear annihilation felt very real. Contemporary audiences won't fully get how black this black comedy is. Nonetheless, this film remains perennially funny, and even after numerous viewings over the last 15 years or so I still laugh every time.", "A U.S. bomber plane is heading for Russia.  Communications are unavailable.  The Commie Russians have built a doomsday device.  And, according to crazy, (wheelchair-bound?), ex-Nazi scientist, Dr. Strangelove, nuclear destruction is upon us all!  Thanks to this eccentric comedy, I now have considerable respect for the talent of Peter Sellers.  How he pulled off three totally different roles so convincingly is just beyond me.  Especially his portrayal of the U.S. President; I could hardly believe that British Peter Sellers could do an American accent that naturally.  This was apparently a very black comedy for its time, as the threat of nuclear war was really a thing when this was filmed.  Offbeat, humorous script includes some eyebrow-raising, edgy dialogue and scenes.\r\n\r\nWould I recommend?  Yes, to those with a open mind, or a taste for a truly bizarre kind of comedy.", "**Sex and war in an extremely sarcastic and intelligent film.**\r\n\r\nThis film is one of the best of director Stanley Kubrick's career, and is also one of the most iconic and acidic satire that cinema has ever seen. Inspired by a tense novel that was published in the same period, and by the political and military events that were taking place at the time, the film shoots in all directions to give us the most absurd and ridiculous image of the rivalry between the USA and the Soviet Union. Despite everything, and all the points in favor, I don't think this film is a true comedy. To me, honestly, it didn't make me laugh, although I absorb and understand the acidic irony that is here.\r\n\r\nThe script begins with a very serious incident that could be true (and the US even reviewed its military strategies in order to prevent something similar from happening in real life): after inventing, in his troubled mind, a crazy conspiracy theory according to which the Soviets are poisoning American drinking water, a crazed general initiates a pre-orchestrated military protocol designed to retaliate against a Russian attack with the full force of their nuclear arsenal. But with one detail: there was no Russian attack, which would make the Americans the aggressor country, and responsible for a holocaust of biblical proportions. Informed of this, the president meets with his generals and, in direct articulation with the Kremlin, tries by all means to prevent the worst.\r\n\r\nWhat's extraordinary about this film is the way it ridicules the sexual arousal that several characters have around nuclear war. For these characters, the end of the world, total war, is an absolute fetish, portrayed in almost erotic detail. The most obvious cases are Generals Ripper and Turgidson: each, in his own way, vehemently expressing the mental connection they make between sex and war. Whether by the way they speak and express themselves, or more implicitly, by holding phallic elements that are increasingly evident, they are men who are horny in war. In the same line of thought, the commander of the American aircraft, who becomes a cowboy on horseback in the bomb, as if this were an extension of his male phallus. And what about the character of Strangelove? His name says it all! He is a Nazi scientist in the service of the Americans, and the way he tries to contain his excitement in anticipation of the end of the world is evident, for example, in the idea he suggests of a bunker where the survivors, handpicked (the Nazi idea of the eugenics is very present here), would spend their time having sex to save the human race.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the great films in the career of Peter Sellers, a British actor who is famous for comedy. I've seen several of his films, and I already know his ability to play more than one character in the same film. Here, he gives life to three of the main characters, always with the same quality and professionalism. He is so good that it was really difficult to recognize the actor. George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are also to be congratulated for the work they did in this film, which was certainly one of the ones that most immortalized them as actors.\r\n\r\nThe best technical aspect of the film is the cinematography. Kubrick used various techniques to convey his erotic-military message, such as the opening credits, where an in-flight refueling becomes a symbolic copulation. The camera framing was also thought out in detail, with strategically placed close-up scenes, some characters very well highlighted and others reduced to the smallest expression of themselves (the American president, who is portrayed as incompetent, like his army is able to control). The film is a true lesson in black-and-white cinematography. The sets and costumes are also excellent, and the attack on the air base is one of the best and most realistic combat scenes I've seen in a modern war film. The soundtrack, finally, is one of the most ironic there is, and it perfectly matches the tone of the film. Highlight, of course, for the opening and ending themes.", "Just as \"Seven Days in May\" was hitting our screens, Stanley Kubrick used a superbly over-the-top effort from Sterling Hayden to depict a rogue general who has decided to use all the checks and balances in place to defend the United States to his own mischievous advantage and launch a pre-emptive bombing campaign on those pesky \"Ruskies\". It's only his perfectly moustachioed British executive officer \"Mandrake\" (Peter Sellers) who smells a rat, but he is on lockdown in their air force base that is, indeed, being besieged - but not by the \"Reds\". Meantime, the American President (also Sellers) is only just finding out that he's about to start a nuclear war and nobody knows quite how to top it - not even his chief of staff \"Turgidson\" (George C. Scott). A call to his opposite number in the Kremlin reveals that the Soviets haven't been letting the grass grow, and that they have their own shield - and one that's use would make the effects of the Hiroshima bomb look like a damp squib. With all this mistrust and mayhem abounding, is it going to be possible to avert the destruction of humanity? Sellers has multiple parts and carries them out effectively, but it's the support from Hayden, Scott and the gung-ho, yee-ha, merchant \"Maj. Kong\" (Slim Pickens) - in charge of the heavily laden bomber that is likely to stat the conflagration, that demonstrate really entertainingly not just the faults in the whole principle of a paranoia-driven command and control structure, but also of the flaws of human nature when it comes to increasing reliance on technology and automation. The calculating eponymous character, who could have come straight out of a \"Bond\" movie, also quite cleverly points to the provenance of so many of the scientists who supported the West's military programming whilst their historical loyalties were dubious at best. It's only ninety-odd minutes, but packs plenty to think and laugh about as the ridiculousness and seriousness of the scenario are presented satirically and potently, at a time when the cold war was warmer."], ["25 years on, and this Danny Boyle effort has lost little of it's authentic, gritty, potency. Set in mid 1990s Edinburgh it follows the antics of a disparate group of friends whose only goals in life are to survive, maybe get laid, and to take each day as it comes... \"Begbie\" (Robert Carlyle) is their psychopathically charged leader, who thinks nothing of smashing a glass in someone's face; \"Spud\" (Ewan Bremner) and \"Sick Boy\" (Jonny Lee Miller) just lurch from one day to the next looking for a fix; \"Tommy\" (Kevin McKidd) at least tries to live with some semblance of normality - he has a steady girlfriend \"Diana\" (Kelly Macdonald) and finally Ewan McGregor (\"Renton\"), whom along with his worldly, and in their way loving, parents, might just see a way of escaping from this relentless misery... What helps this stand out is the fact that director Boyle misses few opportunities to depict the grim depravity in which these people live. Its graphic, violent, distressing certainly, but it is also funny and eminently human - there is a definite sense of \"there but for the grace of God\" about many of the scenarios and they tugs at the heart strings whilst simultaneously making you cower and wince in disgust or sometimes even fear. The efforts from the talent in indistinguishably good - especially Bremner and JLM whose roles are not so significant as Messrs Carlyle & McGregor's, but who add a depth and richness to what could otherwise just prove to be a rather downbeat tale of hopelessness and emptiness. For once, the gratuitous (for, that it is) use of good old Anglo-Saxon expletives doesn't not appear merely to compensate for a lack of script-writing skills; here the language and violence add significantly to the plausibility of the whole thing - it's ghastly, yet compelling to watch and watch again. It works well again on a big screen, even though the cinematography doesn't really require anything to present scale or grandness, and the soundtrack adds a deliciously contemporaneous dollop of nostalgia, too. Not for the fainthearted, but - in my view - the finest work from all concerned that stands the test of time very well.", "Not the most enthralling, but <em>'Trainspotting'</em> does have plenty to say - and boy does it portray it!\r\n\r\nThere are particularly strong performances from Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner and Robert Carlyle. I didn't like watching the bunch of characters given how severely unlikeable they are. Of course, that is very much the intention so it's a credit to the actors and the filmmakers at how convincing it all is. The humour is weaker than expected, perhaps due to the horrors of the plot taking centre stage.\r\n\r\nTheir struggles are showed in a heavy manner, to the point I did feel uncomfortable seeing them <em>do their thing</em>. I do feel post-watch that I'm missing something from it in regards to being able to appreciate it higher, I can't shake that feeling. That's probably the only negative at nailing the realness so much, you miss out on other bits to enjoy about a film; or at least to me.\r\n\r\nCool to see this on the big screen, mind. I think it's the first movie I've ever watched at the cinema that isn't a contemporary release. I evidently hadn't seen this before so thought what better way to watch it for the opening time!

However, at school, she comes across a cruel and sadistic headmistress who will become her biggest adversary, while her teacher becomes her best friend.\r\n\r\nIt's a very good and enjoyable film, with a nice comedy genre and some fantasy. The characters are reasonably well done, albeit a bit artificial in their conception, and the cast is very good. Mara Wilson, despite her youth, shone in the lead role and guaranteed the start of her acting career. Danny DeVito, who also ensures an effective and well-executed direction, does a very intelligent job as an actor, being well assisted by Rhea Perlman. And while Embeth Davidtz delivers a good performance, it's Pam Ferris's overwhelming and committed performance as a villain that steals our attention, in a work that is as iconic and striking as it is histrionic and over-the-top.\r\n\r\nIt may go unnoticed, in the midst of the comedy and lightness of the film itself, but I felt that there is here, well marked in the Wormwoods, a harsh sarcastic critique of a certain American middle class: like many American families, they learned to do everything, or almost everything, in front of the television screen, and they do not value each other, being in every respect a largely dysfunctional family. He's a crook, she's vain, vain and addicted to gambling, the eldest son doesn't seem to have any prospects for the future or know what he wants from his own life. As a family, they value nothing but easy money, as evidenced by the weird TV show style they adore and the cheap, tasteless decor of their home. Despite everything, they think they are much smarter than others for being that way.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's a low-key film. The cinematography is in line with what one would expect in a comic film of this decade, prolific in good comedies, and the sets and costumes are good and convincing, particularly the school. The film has some special, visual and sound effects, most of which do their job well, without demerits.

Enter Macaulay Connor, an unassuming reporter who deals with more than his share of the crazy antics, and nearly gets married, before the film's end.  This is an excellent, funny, and wholly diverting romantic comedy from that grand old director, George Cukor (one of my favorites).  With three very talented, knockout stars, the film sure couldn't go wrong, and of course James Stewart snagged his Best Actor Oscar for it.  And there's Cary Grant, spouting delightful nonsense all over the place, such is this memorable little one-liner: \"No mean Machiavelli is smiling, cynical Sidney Kidd!\"  Oh, and let's not forget Virginia Weidler, as uppity little Dinah Lord.  Now she's just a total hoot!  Be sure and catch this hilarious classic, _darling_.  A movie as classy as its high-society characters, and worthy of its reputation.", "**A film that has qualities, but that has also been overvalued over the decades.**\r\n\r\nThis was certainly one of the most interesting films of 1940, a time when the world was more attentive to the development of the war in Europe than to what was done by the actors. Based on a play that had great success on Broadway, George Cukor offers us an elegant and practical film, with material that allows the actors to show some talent, but which is still too theatrical at several moments, like a recorded play.\r\n\r\nDespite being considered a classic at times, I think it is a minor work for everyone: Cukor will always be best remembered for \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d; Cary Grant shined much brighter in \u201cNorth By Northwest\u201d and \u201cCharade\u201d; Hepburn will always be remembered for \u201cLion in Winter\u201d and Stewart, one of Hitchcock\u2019s favorites, ensured eternity in \u201cVertigo\u201d and \u201cRear Window\u201d. However, it is undeniable that they are great actors and Cukor was one of the great directors of the time, which allows us to guess the importance the studio gave to this production then. The director's work is elegant, clear and well executed; Grant is good at playing the funny cynic and Hepburn follows him without a problem. It's worth seeing these two great actors in the same scene. Stuart, however, seems strange, does not develop properly and the result of his efforts is frankly poor, considering his capabilities.\r\n\r\nWhere the film makes the most mistakes is in the script, a conventional play with a contained and discreet humor, based on word puns that are lost every time we have to watch subtitled versions in our language (that's my case, as a native speaker of Portuguese), and which never goes beyond the average. The characters wander around the house, talking sarcastically, and the action is slow and predictable. I can't understand how the film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, nor the Oscar for Best Actor, for Stewart.

The four at the top of the bill gel perfectly here as the ghastly \"Tracy\" has to face a few home truths and perhaps the most potent example of \"in vino vertitas\" ever to hit the silver screen. The whole thing comes across as natural and at times our (safe) vantage point offers us a cutting reflection on people for whom money has no meaning, true, but for whom the feelings of other people has even less. The writing delivers some biting dialogue at times and we've some fun from \"Uncle Willie\" (Roland Young) thrown in to augment the confusion of the entertaining discord that is ensuing.

Vertigo was so strange already from the beginning because of its surreal and nightmarish atmosphere. I bow to Hitchcock in his creativity in visualizing Jimmy Stewart\u2019s acrophobia by implementing one of the oldest cinematography techniques, using zoom lens as it zooms in while the object moves away, emphasizing his terrified feeling and insecurity whenever he\u2019s at a particular height due to a chronic vertigo he suffers. As always, the film director\u2019s cameo appearance has always been fascinating since we know it\u2019s his habit therefore we will usually let our eyes wander throughout the film, trying to spot him. In conclusion, this timeless thriller remains a classic gem despite the emergence of new modern films. The great visual effects also seem timeless when compared to digital effects.

But of course, a much darker, and more down-to-earth, secret lies beneath the surface.  \r\n\r\nComments: James Stewart is the perfect anti-hero in this: clever and brave, but also disturbed, unhinged, and at times possessive.  He does a stellar job with a difficult role.\r\n\r\nIn the supporting role of Stewart's faithful friend \"Midge\" is Barbara Bel Geddes, and she does a delightful job. \r\n\r\nAccording to one source I've read, after Vertigo flopped upon release, Hitchcock blamed Stewart, claiming he (Stewart) was too old and people no longer wanted to see him, hence the film's lack of success.  When Hitchcock went on to do North By Northwest, Stewart reportedly begged Hitchcock for the lead role, but Hitchcock refused, giving the lead to Cary Grant, who was actually four years older than Stewart.\r\n\r\nBut according to a biography of Cary Grant written by Pamela Trescott, the reason Hitchcock wanted Grant instead was simply because they worked well together and had wanted to do another collaboration after the success of To Catch a Thief.  In short, that the lead role for North By Northwest had been intended for Cary Grant, and no one else, right from the beginning.  \r\n\r\nAll that aside, Vertigo has established a high reputation as a masterpiece of film, and rightly so.  It's also beautifully photographed, and the entire film has a soft, haunting, dreamy quality to it that's utterly captivating.", "Not one of my favorites from Hitchcock, and certainly dower, but still visually striking and two amazing performances from James Stewart and Kim Novak.

Forced to go out on the lam, Thornhill lurches from one perilous scenario to another. Can he survive to prove his innocence? Is the gorgeous blonde who is helping him really a friend? All will be revealed in Alfred Hitchcock's majestic thriller. \r\n\r\nIf deconstructing it you find that this isn't a perfect Hitchcock movie, for it under uses James Mason's coolly vile Phillip Vandamm (which is a crime), and it also doesn't have a female lead acting with any great urgency since Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall fails to fully fulfil the promise of Kendall's arrival in the movie. Yet this film rightly earns the right to be on any critics top 100 list, to be a favourite amongst the legion of Hitchcock fans (of which I'm one of that number), for it is escapist entertainment in its purest form, Hitchcock's most accessible popcorn entertainment piece. \r\n\r\nFrom the moment at the film's opening when you hear Bernard Herrmann's wonderful music, it's enough to send goose pimples all over the body. For it is a musical portent that signifies we are about to get a fusion of thrills, mystery, and some cheeky Hitchcock humour, accompanied by heroes and villains all condensed purely for our enjoyment. Fronted by a diamond Cary Grant performance as the man wrongly mistaken for another that leads to him being pursued frighteningly across the states, the pic is never found wanting for genre high points. Coming as it did after the darkly brilliant and soul sapping Vertigo, Hitchcock clearly wanted to hang loose and enjoy himself. \r\n\r\nWorking from a fabulous script by Ernest Lehman, North By Northwest's very reason for being is purely to entertain those wanting to invest a frame of mind with it, with Hitchcock cunningly putting us on side with what is ultimately a shallow character in Grant's Roger O (the O doesn't stand for anything) Thornhill. It's a neat trick from the master of trickery and devilment. Some of the scenes on show are now almost folk lore such is the esteem in which they are held by movie fans and makers alike. A crop dusting aeroplane attack (the prelude to which has those goose pimples popping up in anticipation), a pursuit on Mount Rushmore and the often forgotten drunk car on a cliff sequence, these are all trade mark pieces of work from Hitchcock. \r\n\r\nNorth By Northwest is in my humble opinion one of the true greats of cinema history, where as bleak and as unnervingly brilliant as Vertigo was the previous year, this is the polar opposite in structure and fable, but the result is most definitely equally as great.

What Hitchcock delivers now is a slowly unravelling adventure mystery with loads of red herrings, plenty of well written and executed humour from Grant and a gradually accruing sense of menace as we finally realise just what is going on. The photography is intimate one moment, all-encompassing the next, the crop dusting scene is the stuff of cinema legend and I challenge any non-American to name the fourth bloke atop Mount Rushmore at the end.

Tony Curtis (Joe) and Jack Lemmon (Jerry) are the stars of the show, with amusing performances from start-to-finish. Marilyn Monroe is pleasant too, this is actually the first film of Monroe's I've seen. A good'un!\r\n\r\nThe pacing isn't perfect but that doesn't hamper things at all really. It's a bonkers 122 minutes, filled with entertaining shenanigans - the ending is particularly wacky. Don't think I would've liked it as well without Curtis & Lemmon, admittedly.\r\n\r\nWorth watching, without question.", "**One of Curtis' best films... and an effective and enjoyable comedy.**\r\n\r\nFor many, this movie is simply one of the greatest comedies of all time. However, I have serious doubts about that. In my personal opinion, it's a good comedy, it entertains its audience very well, and there's no doubt about its status as a movie classic. Starting from this reasonable basis and placing the film at the heights as the best or one of the best already seems unreasonable and exaggerated. But that's just what I think.\r\n\r\nThe script is set during the Prohibition, a time when speakeasies were one of the biggest sources of financial income for mobsters. The script starts from this context and creates an interesting and reasonably well-written story, where two jazz musicians end up becoming witnesses to a massacre, in which a group of mobsters kills a rival group in Chicago. This, of course, was inspired by a true, very famous incident, the Valentine's Day Massacre. Persecuted and in life danger, they decide to dress up as two women and hide, like members of a female jazz orchestra that takes a train to the coast, to perform in a hotel. Of course, then the funniest part of the movie begins, with the characters trying to keep the cover-up amid the romantic shenanigans that unfold.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a good script and good dialogue, the film has very good performances by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, the two great male protagonists. For me, this is one of the most interesting films of both their careers, and it's great to see the way they both played together. I also liked the works of George Raft and Joe E. Brown, which gives soul and grace to the end, very famous and funny. Pat O'Brien also does a good job, even if he doesn't follow his peers closely. But the film was probably better known to audiences thanks to the female star, Marilyn Monroe. But I don't like her work here. She was an extraordinary singer, and her best scenes are the ones where she sings... but I never thought of her as a good and talented actress (she couldn't even memorize what she had to say, and the director practically swore that would never work with her again): and, really, her performance in the film is irritating, turning the character into a sly young woman and something of an idiot.\r\n\r\nThe film doesn't make a big bet on the technical aspects, but it offers us high quality sets and costumes, good effects and an effective soundtrack. From the beginning, it takes on a pleasant rhythm that allows the two hours of duration to pass without us noticing. It also features good cinematography, with a regular filming job that makes the best use of selected filming locations.", "I really don't get the comedy here.\r\nCurtis and Lemmon dress up as showgirls to avoid the mob.\r\nThat's good for a five minute sketch, but not a full length movie.\r\nAnd that's the problem. It is stretched out to be an ordeal. For some reason, some guy likes Lemmon as a woman, and Lemmon avoids him. And for some reason, Curtis likes a relatively plain showgirl (Marilyn Monroe was always a \"woman's woman\", not in the league with the beauties of Hollywood, which was her appeal, being the \"girl next door\" instead of \"the girl you wanted next door\" Dawn Welles or Raquel Welch.\r\nBut who is lucky enough to get Dawn Welles next door to him? Which is why we get the more down to earth looks of Marilyn to be popular in movies.\r\nThe \"comedy\" was \"dated\" even in the sixties. I'm not sure it was even funny in 1959, but it appears to have a designated target audience of people who like super dry humor disguised as slapstick, or whatever you call this vain attempt to be funny.\r\nIt isn't a \"terrible movie\", and it isn't depressing, but it is quite dull.

The top-notch cast is, I think, a big part of what makes this film so memorable, and much-heralded through the years.  The script is truly well-written and moving.  My only complaint is, how could they do something so awful as killing off Peter Lorre within the first quarter of the film?\r\n\r\nWould I recommend?  Overall, yes.  There's a reason people cite this as one of the best films ever made.  Though there are others I like much more, it is very, very good.", "You must remember this...\r\n\r\nAre my eyes really brown?\r\n\r\nCasablanca is one of those films that needs no introduction - or in truth - any more in-depth dissection as to its worth. Over the years it has become one of the most quoted ever pictures (sometimes wrongly), and in reality it's arguably more iconic than it is a work of art. Although a truly \"A\" list production for 1942, fact is nobody in and around the film expected it to be anything other than a good piece that will put bums on the seats in the theatres. Solidly received on release and riding in on the wave of the Allies inroads into North Africa, Casablanca steadily overcame the much discussed production troubles (the script was practically rewritten daily) to be where it is now, one of the most loved film's of all time.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't mention Paris, it's poor salesmanship!\r\n\r\nSo what is it about Casablanca that makes it so cherished and adored by each and every generation?. I just know that each time I view it (yearly) it's like falling in love again, each viewing brings a new and emotionally driven fulfilment. Tears flow, sad ones and happy ones, an overriding feeling that romantic idealism isn't dead, to which Casablanca becomes my personal myth buster. Thematic redemption brings a joyous reward, even as our daydreams about lost chances and lost loves hangs heavy in and around Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain. Everything about Casablanca is right, from the flawless direction (Michael Curtiz) to the iconic music, and of course the magnificent characters that are brought to life by the incredibly tight and effective cast. It may not be the greatest film of all time, but to me, and those who let it into their lives, it's one of the best friends anyone could ever hope to have. 10/10", "I've just seen this on a big screen for the first time in over thirty years - no enhancements, 4K, HD - just as Michael Curtiz saw it back in 1942 and it's a cracking piece of cinema. \"Rick Blaine\" (Humphrey Bogart) runs his Casablanca caf\u00e9 as a literal oasis in the North African desert - a refuge for all sorts fleeing the oppression of the Nazis in nearby Europe. Enter \"Ilsa\" (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband, a Czech resistance leader \"Hector Lazlo\" (Paul Henried) and we discover that \"Rick\" and her have a past, and when the pursuing \"Maj. Strasser\" (Conrad Veidt) and local police chief Claude Rains (\"Capt. Renault\") get involved in this cocktail of deceit and duplicity things gradually come to the boil in a wonderfully evocative, sophisticated fashion. Bogart and Bergman positively smoulder; the chemistry is electric - she, as usual, doesn't actually act - she is just herself, and that's all she needs to do. Rains is great as the conniving policeman as is Veidt delivering the rather sparse, but no less potent, dialogue perfectly. Like most of the best films, the key to this is it's (seemingly effortless) simplicity - and this one also has a wonderful musical score to complement the tensely directed, eerily shot, story augmented by an hugely talented supporting cast with the likes of Peter Lorre and the superbly sleazy Sydney Greenstreet. There was a great deal wrong and inhibiting with the \"studio system\" that prevailed at the time, but when it did work it could pull together an astonishing collection of people in front of, and behind the camera and create masterpieces like this.", "**One of the best movies of all time.**\r\n\r\nUnlike some people, I believe that there are perfect movies. It doesn't happen easily, but they do exist, and I'm pretty sure this is one of them. A classic in its own right, which has withstood the test of time and continues to win sympathies today, it is one of the most outstanding films in American cinema, a work that goes beyond aesthetics, art and culture, and which, over the decades, became part of the collective memory, part of the universal cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nThe film was made in 1942, in the midst of World War II, and its production was conditioned by severe restrictions on the use of raw materials considered important for the American war effort. So many of the sets are recycled, they were used in a number of other Warner films and adapted here. Another direct consequence that the war brought to this film is the huge amount of real refugees that made up the technical team and the extras, and who are deeply emotionally moved in that famous scene where the French anthem, sung with all their lungs, completely drowns out the chorus of German officers while singing a patriotic march.\r\n\r\nThe script brings us a love story: Rick and Ilsa meet and fall in love quickly in Paris. However, after a few days, the arrival of the victorious Germans in the city forces them to flee, and makes her decide to end the romance. Years later, Rick finds himself established with a bar in the city of Casablanca, in a part of Morocco controlled by the Free France, and where many refugees drink, gamble and seek the money necessary to pay the passes and visas that the authorities demand to be able to go to Portugal, a neutral country where they can, if they wish, head to the United States. It is there that the two lovers end up meeting again, in the midst of a plot that also includes a corrupt French officer, a ruthless German officer and two stolen passes, which everyone seems to want.\r\n\r\nThe cast is elegantly led by two of the biggest stars of their time: on the one hand, the heartthrob Humphrey Bogart, with his characteristic voice and pose, impeccable in one of the most complete and powerful works of his career. He knew perfectly how to give his character a pleasant dose of cynicism, self-centeredness and disenchantment. On the other hand, the beautiful and intelligent Ingrid Bergman in one of her life's works. The film also has good performances by several supporting actors, such as Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt and also Paul Henreid and Claude Rains.\r\n\r\nTechnically, we have great praise for the masterful direction of Michael Curtiz, who had the wisdom to give the film the pace, ambience and elegance it needed to be able to flourish and marvel. With discreet production values \u200b\u200band an effort to contain expenses, the film still never feels cheap, and there's never a moment where we can say that we didn't have money to buy a certain prop, to improve a specific set or costume. The cinematography works very well, and the filming work seems to have been impeccable, with some strategic and well-positioned zooms marking the most dramatic scenes and the juiciest dialogues. The soundtrack doesn't have very resonant themes, but it's impossible to forget \u201cAs Time Goes By\u201d after we've seen this film."], ["This is one of the rare and shining examples of film-making at its absolute finest.  As close to perfect as you can get in movies, it's a masterpiece not only of its genre, but of all genres, for all time.

Well nothing by way of new stuff or a differing slant on the plot, I can merely concur and hopefully jolt prospective first time viewers into believing the reputation afforded this stunning piece of cinema.\r\n\r\nFirst off I have to let it be known that this is far from being my favourite Bogart movie, in fact it's not even my favourite Bogart movie from 1941!, it's well trumped in my affections by \"High Sierra\", but few films ever get as close to being perfect as \"The Maltese Falcon\" clearly is. The source from Dashiell Hammett is first rate, and yet it took someone like John Huston (director and screenwriter) to bring it triumphantly together. It had been adapted for the screen twice before with less than favourable results, but Huston, working tightly from Hammett's dialogue driven astuteness, crafts a claustrophobic, shadowy classic amongst classics, that in the process laid the cornerstone for what became known as essential film noir.\r\n\r\nYou will search in vain for faults here, every scene is as tight as a duck's bottom, not one filler scene is in this picture. The cast are across the board perfect in performances, Bogart (Spade) is peerless, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet (film debut) and Elisha Cook Jr. stand out, but every other member of this cast also add something worthwhile. The plot (of which I'm \"so\" not going to summarise for you) is complex to a degree, but really it all makes sense, you do not need to be Albert Einstein to knit the twisters nicely together. Also don't be fooled into thinking this is a film devoid of humour either, it has deadly wry smirks popping up all over the place, ok so they may be the sort of smirks brought about by devilish unease of admiration, but rest assured they are valid and integral to the pic's classic standing.\r\n\r\nI could go on fawning but I really don't need too, The Academy may well have saw fit to not award this picture any awards for 1941, but time is an immeasurable force sometimes, and time now shows that The Maltese Falcon stands proud as not only a titan of cinematic entertainment, but also of technical movie brilliance. 10/10", "This is a pretty good movie that ages fairly well, but I do not feel compelled to pour superlatives down over as most reviews do, both critics and regular viewers.

And all the patter about love between Sam Spade and Miss O\u2019Shaughnessey seemed silly to me, as there was never any sign they were connecting and getting closer: never mind they were also plotting each other\u2019s downfall. Personally, Sam, I think your own assistant Effie was cuter, sweeter and a better catch.\r\n\r\nBut the movie is fun to watch and the mystery solving ending by Mr. Spade is top-notch stuff.

Well: they were right about one thing - her story was riddled with holes, but not so many as \"Archer\" becomes, and soon \"Spade\" and the police are trying to track down/avoid the murderer whilst trying to establish some sort of motive.

Will \"Spade\" get to the bottom of the mystery before he ends up brown bread? That's where the film falls down a bit - there is precious little jeopardy to the plot; indeed the last fifteen or twenty minutes are just a little disappointing - rushed even. Bogey is superb in the part, though - his portrayal reeks of a wonderful cynic, a seen-it-all-before ground down sort of man who takes his first drink of the day from the same glass he took his last from the day before and Astor is efficient, though not terribly engaging, as the lynchpin upon which much of the film depends. It's 80 years old now - and I still think the use of a strong score from Adolph Deutsch, some wonderfully evocative lighting and effects (it rains quite a lot!) and, of course, a strong cast with a good story, takes some beating."], ["The difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she is treated. \r\n\r\nUpper crust phonetics Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) agrees to a wager that he can make brash London speaking flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) presentable in high society. \r\n\r\nLerner and Loewe's Broadway version of George Bernard Shaw's play \"Pygmalion\" comes to the big screen and is an utter joy.

And to prove the usefulness of this domain, he decides to take a very simple and popular woman, the flower seller Eliza, into his own home and train her like a dog. When it's all over, he effectively achieved a big change in that girl, both in terms of speech and behavior, as well as in terms of mentality and life expectations.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to talk about what bothers me most: the way that annoying and presumptuous character decides to use another person for his purposes without thinking about that. Higgins is a selfish and egoic man, as well as being clearly misogynistic and thinking he has the power to mold people to his liking. In addition, the script confuses different things: knowing how to speak well and knowing how to behave in society. I can know how to speak my language in the most perfect way and not know the rules I should follow at a social ball or gala dinner. They are different things. The issue is addressed in the Ascott scenes, but we are left without knowing how Eliza learned to behave from then on.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film is incredible. It seeks to adapt a Broadway musical, but it also draws a lot of inspiration from an older film, from the 30s. Thus, it has excellent melodies and songs, the same as the original musical. Unfortunately, the actors barely sing a syllable: they were sung by professionals off-stage, in a bad decision by the producers that greatly upset Audrey Hepburn herself. Another flaw is the confusion in the period conception: the film takes place in 1911 or 1912, but there is a wide range of later props and a moment in which the English king is not the one who actually reigned at the time. The film largely compensates for these flaws with excellent cinematography, very well framed and bright, full of vibrant and intense colors (note: I saw the restored version of the film), and with incredible costumes, particularly those made for Hepburn, and which still have a place today in private collections and museums: I think one of her costumes was auctioned off for a fortune a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe cast has several important actors. Audrey Hepburn brilliantly assumes the role of Eliza, which had previously been played by Julie Andrews on Broadway, and takes advantage of this opportunity to clearly demonstrate her talent. However, I feel that the film doesn't take full advantage of the actress' potential and doesn't give her the space to give her all. Thus restrained, Hepburn does what she can, but fans will be able to see her in much better shape in other films. The one who dominates the scene the most is Rex Harrison: the actor exudes talent and seems perfectly suited for the character that, in fact, he had played on Broadway for a few years. We cannot forget the contributions of Stanley Holloway and Jeremy Brett, who do a very good job on underutilized characters.", "A recent survey asserted that the English had the sexiest accents in the world. Perhaps not exactly the sort of recognition \"Prof. Henry Higgins\" (Rex Harrison) was seeking when, exasperated by the standards of his native language being spoken around London, he plucks poor \"Eliza\" (Audrey Hepburn\") from her flower-selling and promises his equally plummy friend \"Col. Pickering\" (Wilfred Hyde-White) that he can train her to pass in more refined society as a Duchess. Despite her initially raucous protestations - exemplifying his very point, the two lock in a battle of wills that ultimately challenges both of their opinions of each other, and dare we even suspect - engenders perhaps some respect... or more...? Oscar, BAFTA & Golden Globe winning Harrison is superb as the jovially pompous professor whose disdain for just about everything and everyone is writ large, Hepburn (with a lot of musical assistance from Marni Nixon) manages the transformation from \"gutter snipe\" to \"toff\" magnificently and there are some wonderfully characterful contributions from Stanley Holloway as her (rather venal) father; from Gladys Cooper as his rather astute mother and of course the arbiter of all things elocutionary - \"Prof. Karpathy\" (Theodore Bikel) who famously concludes that our poor \"Eliza\" is Hungarian! George Cukor has worked his magic well here with a superbly colourful, pithy and engaging adaptation of the original Shaw story and the score from Lerner and Loewe offers us some of the best rhyming lyrics ever put on paper: \"Why Can't The English\" and \"I could have Danced All Night\" being two particular favourites as well as Holloway's cracking \"I'm Getting Married in the Morning\". In a time of much more in-your-face politically correct dramatisations, I think folks could take a look at this cleverly constructed swipe at intellectual and sexual \"superiority\" and see the best man win - even if she isn't a man..."], ["We start with the sight of a young girl cleaning the limousine her father drives for the wealthy \"Larrabee\" family. She has a crush on the younger brother \"David\", but that is but a pipe dream as she grows up and is sent to Paris where she learns cordon bleu cooking skills. Upon her return, the now much older \"David\" (William Holden) offers her a lift and though he doesn't recognise her, it is soon clear that she has lost none of her affections for him, and he now reciprocates. This throws a spanner in the works for the older brother \"Linus\" (Humphrey Bogart) who plans a large scale merger to make his bouncy glass, and that involves his brother marrying the daughter of the partner company. \"David\" is having none of this, but after he has an untimely accident involving his backside and some broken glass, \"Linus\" concocts a plan to send \"Sabrina\" back to France. This erstwhile steely man does not, however, factor in the effect his hanging out with this vibrant and intelligent young woman is going to have on him - and pretty soon he is just as smitten as his brother! John Williams adds value as her stiff upper lipped father; \"Waltons\" fans might recognise Ellen Corby in the role of his hyper-confident secretary \"Miss McCardle\" and Billy Wilder's script is entertaining and witty. There is a great chemistry on screen between the hugely charismatic Hepburn and Bogart and we do learn how not to make a souffl\u00e9 omelette! Great fun.", "**An excellent romantic comedy and one of Billy Wilder's best works.**\r\n\r\nI saw this film yesterday and I really liked it. I have seen other films with the same actors and there is no doubt that they ooze talent, and it is always a safe bet to see the films they made. This romantic comedy, unlike many of those currently produced, does not seem bland or excessively sugary: the romance and comedy intertwine in the ideal measure to make us laugh and enjoy the characters and the story.\r\n\r\nDirected and intelligently written by Billy Wilder, who gives us one of the best films of his career, it brings us the classic story of the employee's daughter who falls in love with the boss's son. I've seen this in films, in plays, in soap operas in almost every country... it's one of the oldest ideas for a romantic film. What really gives the film strength is the way the director conceives everything and leaves his vision imprinted in every detail. This vision of him includes a very intelligent comedy and a cast full of talents, led by the magnificent Audrey Hepburn, experiencing one of the most interesting moments of his career. She couldn't look more elegant, and it was interesting to see how the actress, so associated with noble or refined characters, embodied one who comes from such modest origins! I also really liked William Holden, who does a very committed and intelligent job. As for Humphrey Bogart... he is always a safe bet, an actor who commits himself to his work and guarantees results, but if even he was aware that he was too old for the role, what can I say? He was absolutely right...\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, there isn't much to say: the film doesn't invest much in great effects and complicated cinematographic resources. In fact, all things considered, it seems like the kind of film where most of the budget was spent on ensuring the presence of a hand-picked cast. The cinematography is quite regular, functional and practical, the soundtrack does not bring great quality notes and goes unnoticed, the sets and costumes fulfill their role wonderfully, but are within what we expected to see. Of course, the costumes are an interesting aspect of the film, with a valuable contribution from Hubert de Givenchy (unfairly uncredited) quite evident behind the production efforts."], ["Lighthearted and enjoyable comedy featuring two wonderful and charismatic performances by Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn in her first major role. Last saw this 12 years ago and still fun to this day. **4.5/5**", "Audrey Hepburn is the visiting princess \"Ann\" whose whistle-stop tour of Europe reaches Rome. Put to bed, as usual, she decides to don some ordinary clothes and venture out for a bit of exploring. Now, initially I thought she was going to hook up with some swarthy, tousled, Lothario but nope - she meets American journalist Gregory Peck - quite the epitome of the ordinary \"Joe\"! Full of the sedatives that her people gave her before she snuck out, she ends up crashing at his apartment and next morning he realises whom she is, and that his boss wants an exclusive! Just about penniless, she leaves and tries to make her way home - but again \"accidentally\" bumps into \"Joe\" and together with his photographer pal \"Irving\" (Eddie Albert), the three embark on some fun and engaging escapades in the Eternal City where this young woman finally manages to escape her cosseted life - she even gets an haircut - before reality gradually starts to reimpose itself on them all. There is a smashing chemistry between Hepburn and Peck; the script and the scenarios allow to us to follow as they gradually fall in love. There is an engaging innocence about Hepburn's performance; she manages to convey a great sense of a woman who is finally free - but knows it can only be temporary, and the scenes with Peck and Albert are entertaining as their cunning plans are continually being altered. Georges Auric's score is classy and mischievous, and the whole stylish look of the film makes it quite delightful to watch. A classic class of less is more!", "**Considered by many to be the first and greatest film of Audrey Hepburn's career.**\r\n\r\nWhat is special about this film? Really, little. The story is very simple: it is the almost adolescent escape of a young princess who, tired of the responsibilities and visibility inherent in a crown, decides to distract herself and live her youth for a few hours. The problem is that she ends up, inadvertently, at the home of an American news journalist in charge of interviewing her, and who wants to take advantage of the situation. Of course, anyone hoping for an interesting dalliance between the princess and the commoner will be rewarded, to some extent. Predictable? Clich\u00e9? Of course, but it was with illusions like these that cinema fed the magic of the monarchical universe, somewhat to its own advantage.\r\n\r\nIf the story told is not particularly brilliant and stands out for its simplicity and a range of obvious choices and solutions, what are we left with? Scenarios? Costumes? Effects? Sound? Cinematography? In part, yes. The sets are very well done, and the film, which is actually filmed in Rome, is one of the first and best cinema postcards of this city. I still know people who have been to Rome, and been where the characters in the film have been too, such as the Trevi Fountain or the Mouth of the Truth, tourist landmarks that this film helped to popularize. Without major effects, it has a nice and atmospheric sound and soundtrack, and the cinematography, in black and white, is very good. The scenes of the two main characters riding a Vespa through the streets of the city center are particularly anthological. We can also say that the film was wonderfully edited, and the story moves at an elegant and pleasant pace.\r\n\r\nBut what would this movie be without Audrey Hepburn? I don't think it's possible to imagine the character in the skin of another actress. She had the nobility and dignified serenity required of royalty, and imbued the character with authenticity, credibility, and friendliness. It's impossible to watch the film and not feel a certain sympathetic affection for her character, who simply wants a few hours to distract herself from the institutional routines and duties for which she was educated. Gregory Peck was a clear choice to be the journalist who helps her and creates a certain romantic affection for her."], [], ["Good thriller from Alfred Hitschcock.", "Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant just ooze charisma in this classic Hitchcock story of espionage and romance. She (\"Alicia\") has taken to the bottle following the conviction of her Nazi father and is heading down the slippery slope when she is approached by \"Devlin\" (Grant) who offers her a chance to redeem herself. She is to ingratiate herself with a group of her father's cohorts in Rio and feed back her intelligence to the CIA. Once in Rio, she is reunited with her arch-Nazi admirer \"Alexander\" (Claude Rains) and, at the insistence of her new boss (Louis Calhern) she marries him. What now ensues is a cleverly developing tale of treachery and betrayal tempered with plenty of humour and a little romance (of course she and \"Devlin\" fall for each other). The photography is both grand and intimate, Roy Webb has scored this perfectly and Hitchcock uses Ben Hecht's story to full effect. This is a classic piece of cinema that I saw quite recently on a big screen - and it is well worth watching again!"], ["The big man was in jovial mood with this one. \r\n\r\nTo Catch A Thief, is, when all is said and done, a softer entry on the great Alfred Hitchcock's CV. By his own admission it was a film he viewed as \"lightweight\", but such is the great mans talent, his softer cinematic efforts still punch the buttons and are films that many filmmakers can readily learn from. \r\n\r\nIn this one Hitchcock is purely making an entertaining piece for those in the right frame of mind, a splendid mixture of comedy and romance which also culminates in no shortage of dramatic entertainment as well. Cary Grant is perfectly debonair as the cat burglar John Robie, who here has to catch a thief because he is the chief suspect for a spout of robberies on the French Riviera. Into the mix is that vision of beauty that is Grace Kelly, this is a woman who could melt the Antartic just by walking over it! Kelly as Frances Stevens spends the majority of the film trying to get into John Robie's pants and this puts a delightful sexual tension into the unfolding story. We get some sparkling scenes here, such as a firework display as the two protagonists flirt and then kiss, thus making the film easy on the eye, and some delicious slices of humour dot themselves throughout as Hitchcock indulges in his wink wink innuendo. The plinking score from Lyn Murray works a treat during a roof top cat sequence, while the ending stays just above average without really having an any over dramatic impact.\r\n\r\nAll in all it's a very tidy effort that is always worth spending time with on a lazy Sunday afternoon with a glass of vino in hand. 7/10", "Fluffy mystery-romance-thriller excels thanks to the wonderful charms of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. For me, this is a lesser Hitchcock film but still had plenty of fun and entertainment value even though there's nothing really noteworthy in terms of the story or any particular scene. **3.75/5**", "Cary Grant is on excellent form in this ultra-sophisticated crime caper. Having long since retired to life on the C\u00f4te D'Azur, \"John Robie\" finds himself at the centre of enquiries as his \"Cat\" appears to have resurrected itself and is robbing rich folks of their jewels. John Williams again steals his scenes - this times as the insurance adjuster \"Hughson\" who is convinced, enough, by Grant's protestations to agree to work with him to find the true culprit. Enter the wealthy Jessie Royce Landis (\"Jessie\"), a self-made American millionairess and her glamorous daughter \"Frances\" (Grace Kelly). The mother is determined to find a match for her girl - and well, the romantic roots are well and truly planted. Hitchcock keeps us guessing for quite a while as the romantic and criminal threads develop in parallel before tying together in quite an exciting climax. At times I have found Kelly to be just a touch too aloof, but here she still has enough of a foot on the ground to play her part well providing for an engagingly mischievous chemistry between the two of them.. The attention to detail is super, too - and it's easy to become subsumed in the lazy, rather vacuous, but very enviable lifestyle of the rich and famous!"], ["The Definitive Robin Hood\r\n\r\nA classic in beautiful Technicolor with iconic fencing scenes, dastardly villains, and the definitive Robin and Marian. Mixing adventure, humor, and romance, Michael Curtiz\u2019s film set the bar for Robin Hood movies for decades, so much so that there was a slew of Robin Hood movies in the 40s and 50s that were actually about the sons and daughters of Robin Hood, not wanting to be compared to this version. All the iconic scenes from the story are there, from the staff fight with Little John to the archery contest to Marian\u2019s rescue. Errol Flynn\u2019s best known performance, with De Havilland and Rathbone memorable as Maid Marian and Sir Guy of Gisborne. A treat for young and old.", "Outstanding - no other word for this. Easily the best of the adaptations of the \"Robin Hood\" stories of English folklore from the end of the 13th century. The magnificent colour, costumes, sword and archery prowess, even the slightly unconvincing sets all contribute to an excellent effort. Errol Flynn leads as as the loyal, mischievous outlaw who defies and systematically robs the rich and redistributes to the poor, whilst he awaits the return of the kidnapped King Richard from his prison in Austria. Basil Rathbone, as \"Guy of Gisbourne\" steals this for me; he really does convey a degree of menace and I certainly would rather he had come out on top in the end!! Olivia de Havilland and Claude Rains are brilliant too - as is the underrated Melville Cooper as the hugely incompetent High Sheriff, and Alan Hale who reprises his role as \"Little John\" from the 1922 (Douglas Fairbanks) silent version of this legend. Eugene Pallette and Patric Knowles lead the rest of the usual suspects who make up a wonderfully enthusiastic supporting cast and Korngold comes up with, arguably, his best score of all for this fantastic historical drama."], [], ["Waiter, will you serve the nuts? ...I mean, will you serve the guests the nuts?  \r\n\r\nThe Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. \r\n\r\nPlot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day.\r\n\r\nIt was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and he ordered for it to be completed in under three weeks time! Film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture.\r\n\r\nFrom the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There's also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It's a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. \r\n\r\nIt stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air - a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high.\r\n\r\nSmall budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10"], ["This is a belter of a film! Essentially just a two hander with Cary Grant (\"Walter Burns\") as the editor of a newspaper facing the loss of his ex-wife, and best reporter Rosalind Russell (\"Hildy Johnson\") who has decided to marry Ralph Bellamy (\"Bruce Baldwin\") and start a new life. Anyone who enjoys the modern day writing of folks like Aaron Sorkin will immediately appreciate the depth and class of the clever, witty writing and the superbly fast paced delivery from both as Grant tries all sorts of manoeuvres to change her mind; frame her new fianc\u00e9e and stop a man from going to the electric chair with the aide of little else but a few telephones and the odd interjection from some great supporters - Gene Lockhart, Porter Hall, John Qualen and Abner Biberman as his go-to fixer \"Louie\". Russell is no shrinking violet, either - she has plenty of great one-liners and retorts of her own, and the equality with which they scrap makes this all the more fun.

I just saw it for the first time myself a couple weeks before last Christmas, and I loved it.  It's an uplifting, inspiring, dramatic, and at times laugh-out-loud funny story, with a cast that probably couldn't be improved upon if you tried.  And, of course, it's directed by the superb Frank Capra, whose work I greatly admire.  James Stewart gives a raw, totally honest performance, as the unforgettable George Bailey, who on Christmas Eve is shown exactly why the world, or at least Bedford Falls, can't do without him.  And, there is my favorite line in the whole movie, out of so many memorable quotes, delivered perfectly by Lionel Barrymore, as the evil Mr. Potter: \"And a happy new year to you.  In jail!\"", "Oh my goodness, I am not going to spend much time describing this gold standard of Christmas movies. If you have seen it, you know what it is.

It all crescendos with an ending that you can't help but smile at.\r\n\r\nStewart is excellent in the lead role, you really do see every single emotion that his character goes through. He is, by far, the standout performer, but there are of course good performances from the likes of Donna Reed (Mary), Lionel Barrymore (Henry) and Henry Travers (Clarence).\r\n\r\nI did notice a few weird cuts in there, not that I hold that against it or did it affect my enjoyment - it's just noticeable. I see, via other reviewers, that there's a colour version - Channel 4 showed the black-and-white version over here in the UK. I can't say I felt the need for colour, which is always a good sign.\r\n\r\nWholesome.

Jimmy Stewart is \"George\" - a man who has spent his adult life tirelessly trying to help those less fortunate to make their own way in life - and his savings and loan enterprise is the lifeline for many of them. When that all goes pear-shaped though, he feels a degree of despair that leads him to wish he had never been born. Enter the wonderful Henry Travers as \"Clarence\" - the visiting angel who grants his wish and demonstrates just how life would have looked had he, indeed, never been around. Lionel Barrymore is superb as his domineering competitor \"Mr. Potter\" who wants his name on everything in \"Pottertown\" that he doesn't already own. Donna Reed also shines as his wife, especially towards the end of this Capra masterpiece that uses shadow and the wintry weather to elicit a lovely sense of Christmas, but also of our innate need for warmth and security. It is sentimental, but not in a cloying fashion and the star works his magic, with a wonderful accompaniment from Dimitri Tiomkin, for over two hours that simply flies by.

Katharine Hepburn has never been funnier in her only foray into this type of zany comedy. And Cary Grant a master of both verbal repartee and skillful pratfalls is pure genius.  The plot is both simple and  yet defies description.  Hepburn plays Susan Vance, a rich society gal who is a beautiful kook determined to land Cary Grant a stuffy paleontologist who is desperately in need of being set free from from his stodgy ways.  That Kate does so and much more is the main thrust of the movie.  From their first meeting on a golf course to their final declaration of love atop a set of dinosaur bones the picture is nonstop glorious insanity.

Let's be quite honest, the film is funny, and it's perfect for family viewing, with its well-mannered humor and without the use of more cheesy jokes, common in our contemporary comedy. The action is so fast, everything happens so quickly that we don't have time to think much. It's not a film to analyze rationally, because it would fall like a house of cards. It's a film to watch with willingness and mental openness to successive jokes.\r\n\r\nCary Grant needs no introduction and, as he has done many plays and comedy work, he is perfectly comfortable with this type of material and the role he has been given. The result of his work is excellent: it will never be one of the defining films of the actor's career, but it is an honorable addition to his filmography and is unmissable for Grant's admirers. Katharine Hepburn, on the other hand, did not have great comedic ability nor had she done significant comedy work before this film.

Forester, it's believed that the original intention was to film it as an outright drama, but whether by star design or a going with the flow attitude, the picture turned out to be a drama fused with splices of humour, the kind where the tongue gets firmly stuck in the cheek.\r\n\r\nAs character pieces go, The African Queen has few peers, especially in the pantheon of 50s cinema, then you add the excellent story to work from, with the location work in Congo and Uganda expertly utilised by Huston (clearly revelling in the mix) and his photographer, Jack Cardiff. Then there is that magical flow, just as The African Queen (the boat itself) is flowing down the river, so does the film effortlessly glide along without pretentious posturing, screaming out that this is as a humane a story as you are likely to witness again. Some cynical reviewers will point to the dated studio filmed segments as a reason why this film shouldn't be termed a classic amongst classics, but really it's only an issue if you want it to dim your appreciation of the splendour from every other frame. From Bogart and his wry or humorous expressions, to Hepburn and the art of acting prim, this is a pure joy and justly it deserves to make all those lists containing greatest films of all time. 10/10", "Saw this at the BFI in London recently and it looks superb on a big screen. Essentially a two-hander with screen legends Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn who have to escape the approaching WWI German East African forces by sailing down a river on a boat held together by chewing gum and a lot of good luck! Robert Morley has a small role at the start, and plays it to a \"T\" - setting us up for a cracking adventure yarn that ends up being the most unlikely romance you will ever see. John Huston has done a brilliant job with CS Forrester's characters - they are engaging, the trip is enthralling and the ending, though a tad predictable, brings a smile to your face. Originally slated for David Niven and Bette Davis, but hard to imagine they would have been near half so good!", "**A film too American in an Africa still dominated by Europeans.**\r\n\r\nThe film is set in colonial Africa during the First World War, near the Lake Tanganyika area, where the borders of the colonies of Rhodesia (British), Belgian Congo and Tanganyika (German) were formed. It all begins with the German attack on a native Rhodesian village where Protestant missionaries were based. After the attacks, the place is visited by a British boatman, owner of a steam barge called \u201cAfrican Queen\u201d and which is apparently dedicated to carrying out river transport. He collects the deceased missionary's sister, and together they decide to go to the lake and attack a German military ship that is blocking the passage of British ships.\r\n\r\nCurrently forgotten, it is one of those cheap adventure films that puts unlikely people doing unnecessary acts of heroism and that anyone in their right mind would refrain from doing if they could. This is the main problem with the script, and the only thing the film really gets wrong: there is no logical reason that leads them to act and attack the Germans, other than idiotic jingoism. Furthermore, it is a film full of good adventures and moments of humor and danger that will certainly entertain the public.\r\n\r\nThe film features two enormous actors in a smaller and less significant effort for their respective careers: Humphrey Bogart is excellent and sufficiently credible, except for the fact that he is obviously North American and is in the middle of Africa, which was completely controlled by the Europeans. A British actor and a British character would have been more convincing. Katherine Hepburn, in turn, gives us work of great strength and personality. I also felt that she might not be the best choice for the character, since there is no place for Americans in this film. The actress, however, puts in a lot of effort and does a very good job.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has many merits: filmed in Africa, the technical team went through enormous difficulties of all kinds to get the production to a successful conclusion, and this includes a series of tropical diseases and logistical difficulties that we can hardly imagine. The cinematography is extraordinary, and the film is visually beautiful. The sets and costumes are convincing, and the soundtrack works well."], [], [], ["It's progressive, it's racist.

The film lends an insider\u2019s look at life in modern-day Saudi Arabia and the changing role of women in a country known for its restrictive gender customs.\r\n\r\nMaryam (Mila Al Zahrani) is an ambitious young doctor working in a small town medical clinic. She\u2019s well-educated and smart, yet she gets daily pushback from many of her male patients and has to work twice as hard to earn the respect of her male colleagues. After she is prevented from traveling to Dubai in search of a better job, a paperwork mix-up leads Maryam to become a candidate for her local city election. Since she wants to make her town a better place, including her major platform of getting the road to the hospital paved, Maryam and her sisters (Dae Al Hilali, Nora Al Awadh) begin planning fundraising and campaign events while their widowed musician father is away on tour. Her candidacy is as challenging as you\u2019d expect, but the woman never loses her sense of determination to move her traditional society forward.\r\n\r\nAl-Mansour\u2019s film, which she also co-wrote, is appropriately serious but filled with lighthearted moments. It\u2019s impossible not to root for Maryam to succeed when she\u2019s challenging the patriarchy of a society that continues to marginalize women. Saudi Arabia\u2019s customs still seem outdated and oppressive by most of the world\u2019s standards, but it\u2019s also sobering to realize that women in every corner of the planet can still face similar pushback when they\u2019re seen as trying to rock the boat.\r\n\r\nThis feature would\u2019ve worked much better as a short film, as it only becomes truly interesting once Maryam announces her candidacy. Everything else is painfully slow going up until that point, and the pacing is too sluggish. The story stalls even further with random, stagnant interludes that feature traditional music (be it a music lesson, a band concert, or a simple song shared between two sisters).\r\n\r\nIn the end, the film is inspirational and shows the ability we all have to change attitudes, one person at a time. A modest act of defiance may start on the local level, but those small steps eventually add up for the greater good."], ["Good afternoon, we are the Barrow gang.\r\n\r\nBonnie & Clyde stands today as one of the most important films of the 60s, it's impact on culture alone marks it out as a piece of work to note, but as gangster films go this one is something of a landmark. Quite how writers Newman & Benton managed to craft a story of two deadbeat outlaws into cinematic heroes is up for any individual viewers scrutiny, but they bloody well do it because we all want to be in the Barrow gang, because we get lost in this romanticised outlawish tale unfolding in front of our eyes.\r\n\r\nThe film is a fusion of incredible violence and jaunty slapstick, and smartly pauses for delicate moments to let us into the psyche of the main protagonists, we know they have hangups, and with that we know they are fallible human beings, and this sets us up a treat for the incredible jaw dropping finale, and the impact of this finale hits as hard now as it did back with the audience's of 1967.\r\n\r\nThe cast are incredible, Warren Beatty gives a truly brilliant performance as Clyde, he looks good and suave tooting those guns, but it's in the tender troubled scenes where he excels supreme. Faye Dunaway as Bonnie is the perfect foil for Beatty's layers, she nails every beat of this gangsters troubled moll. Gene Hackman, Michael J Pollard, and Estelle Parsons put the cherry on the icing to give depth and range to the rest of the Barrow gang, and these fine actors are clothed in gorgeous cinematography courtesy of Burnett Guffrey. To round out the plaudits I finish with love for director Arthur Penn because it's his vision that gives us something of a nostalgic movie that plays up and down with its subjects with cheeky aplomb, in fact it's just like the banjo music that features so prominently throughout this wonderful film.\r\n\r\nNominated for 9 Oscars it won just the two, the entire actors who played the Barrow gang were nominated, and truth be told they all would have been worthy winners, as it is they gave out just the one to the least strongest performance from Estelle Parsons, go figure. It's legacy both in culture and box office lives on and for me Bonnie & Clyde is not only one of the best films of the 60s, it's also one of the best in history. 10/10", "Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) just happens to look out of her window one morning and spots a rather unsavoury looking fella (Warren Beatty) eyeing up her mother's car. Quick as a flash she is dressed and they are in this car never to look back. Realising that they are broke, they decide that robbing provincial shops and garages is actually a lucrative dawdle. It's at a garage, indeed, that they recruit CW Moss (Michael J Pollard) before hooking up with his brother Buck (Gene Hackman) and his wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons) before escalating their crime spree to banks and, of course, resulting in a fatality that cannot fail to galvanise the authorities. Soon they are most wanted with just about every cop in the state on their trail. Fortunately, these are not the best aimers - and their legend begins to grow. They are f\u00eated wherever they go - a poverty stricken population seeing much to admire in their \"entrepreneurial\" spirit. It's history, so we know what happens - but that isn't really too important. Arthur Penn has put together a strong cast - especially Parsons who is great as the hysterical wife caught up in it all and Dub Taylor as the duplicitous \"Moss Snr\". The attention to detail is impressive - it looks great, the motor cars really didn't look like they could pull the skin off a custard. Beatty and Dunaway simply ooze chemistry and as the story progresses I challenge anyone not to be on their side... It's as entertaining and enjoyable to watch on screen as it is to read about the machinations of many in getting the thing made in the first place."], ["I used to consider this second-tier Hitchcock, but a re-watch proved to me just how excellent the script and directing were, as well as how stellar and underrated both Grace Kelly and Ray Milland tend to be, at least presently, three generations after the fact. The suspense is tied tighter than the proverbial drum.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, to this day, I never keep scissors on top of my desk anymore...", "No, I'm afraid my murders would be something like my bridge: I'd make some stupid mistake and never realize it until I found everybody was looking at me. \r\n\r\nMiddle tier Hitchcock it may be, by his own admission, but it's still one of the finest mystery thrillers around. Ray Milland plays Tony Wendice, a former tennis player married to Grace Kelly's Margot, who is the source of his wealth. Fearing his lifestyle is about to come to an end due to her dalliances with American mystery writer, Mark Halliday (Robert Cummins), Tony hatches a plan to have her murdered by an old acquaintance whom he has over a barrel with blackmail. However, the plan backfires and a whole new strategy is needed to save Tony from suspicion.\r\n\r\nBased on the popular and successful play by Frederick Knott (who adapts for the screenplay here), Dial M For Murder was a film Hitchcock had little time for. In fact, having already started work on Rear Window, Hitch treated Dial M For Murder as a jobbing assignment. His mood was further darkened by Jack Warner's insistence that the film be shot in 3D, with all the camera restraints that such a production brings. Perhaps unsurprisingly though, the restraints and general mood of the director brought about very pleasing results. Choosing to go for a claustrophobic single set shoot, Hitchcock resisted the urge to launch things around for 3D effects, instead he used the process to highlight props and angles of the Wendice home. His use of colours here first rate, particularly around his new found favourite actress, Grace Kelly.\r\n\r\nHaving never seen the 3D version (who has I wonder?) I can't say what impact, if any, the gimmick had. But regardless of Hitch's grumblings and general disdain towards the film, he rose to the challenge by challenging himself and actually produced a fine and technically sound picture. Ray Milland is icy cold yet debonair, while John Williams as Chief Inspector Hubbard strides in and walks off with the film. Kelly is adequate enough, it's her least effective turn for Hitch, so early in her career, she was a bit free with her physical love on the set (source \"A Life in Darkness and Light\"), but this highly appealed to (and amused) Hitch and he of course would use her for better rewards post this production. Sadly Cummings is awfully bland and threatens to lose the film momentum when things start to spice up in the last quarter. \r\n\r\nHugely entertaining picture though, one that is ripe with characterisations and of much interest to Hitchcock purists in how he works around the 3D format for his own filmic senses, Dial M For Murder holds up well today as a disquieting mystery thriller. 8/10\r\n ", "Just with a glance at the cast list and the knowledge that it's directed by the legendary film-making genius Alfred Hitchcock, you know it's going to be good.  This taut, nicely-done thriller was originally filmed in 3D, though I wouldn't say it's any less effective when viewed normally.  Ray Milland and Grace Kelly are both very accomplished actors, and are very enjoyable here.  Watch for John Williams as Inspector Hubbard from Scotland Yard; he's like a British Columbo!  The story moves along at a good clip, with interesting dialogue and good twists.  Watch out for that lethal pair of scissors!", "While this is not one of the most popular Alfred Hitchcock films out there, it is still brilliant.\r\n\r\nYou can immediately recognise this film has Sir Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s signature on it from the way the film is shot and its story is told.\r\n\r\nI did not know anything about the film before I started watching it and I am glad I did it. There were plenty of surprises to see me going to the end of the film.\r\n\r\nWould I watch it again? Possibly. Would I make my friends watch it? Definitely.", "It is very obvious that this was written as a play.  It is very heavy on exposition to cover almost all activities that take place outside of the \"essentially\" one room of the apartment.  Nothing wrong with that, but it gives the film a different feel.  This is more of an intellectual exercise than a action-packed murder mystery.  It might have been better to have written Tony as a chess master than a former tennis star.  It would have been a bit more in keeping with his plots and strategies.  Even the action in the actual murder scene is \"play-like\" - a rather exaggerated initial reaction to being stabbed followed by the more drawn out dying, dying, dead finale.\r\n\r\nEach time I watch this movie, I'm always struck by the strange idea that apparently every citizen is required to account for every pound note that they acquire and spend?  I have no idea if this was remotely true in England in 1954, but it seems odd and unlikely.  It's not critical, but it is jarring when they talk about it, because it seems so unnatural.\r\n\r\nThis is a great movie and a great story.  However, the over-head camera angles for some scenes seems a strange choice, and Grace Kelly is clearly under-utilized in this role.  Margot is such a compliant character that it seems very unlikely that she would engage in an extra-marital affair and then be so nonchalant about being with her former lover together with her husband.\r\n\r\nWhile my criticisms might give the impression that I disliked the movie, these are only minor flaws in a superior film.  Hitchcock is able to convey so much through an actor's mere glance - it is incredible!", "This is definitely my favourite Hitchcock thriller. Adapted from Frederick Knott's equally enduring stage play; Ray Milland is wonderfully suave, debonaire and calculating as \"Tony\" who goes to some effort to enact the perfect murder to despatch his cheating wife (Grace Kelly). He hires petty crook Anthony Dawson to do the deed, but it all goes wrong and she ends up alive, well and leaving him with an unforeseen headache. Enter, in my view, the star of this film - John Williams (\"Chief Inspector Hubbard\") a resolutely persistent terrier of a police officer who is not at all convinced by the explanations he is getting and now we play the mother of all cat-and-mouse games. Dimitri Tiomkin's score adds tons to this expertly paced, thoroughly engrossing story that builds to a cleverly developed crescendo."], ["**An iconic, culturally significant film that helped immortalize James Dean.**\r\n\r\nThis is one of those classic films when the theme is teenage rebellion and generational clash. It is undoubtedly good, with a good story and good actors \u2013 it is the film that marked James Dean's short career \u2013 and continues to be a regular presence in classics cycles and specialty TV channels.\r\n\r\nThe film explores quite well the difficult relationship between parents and their children within the wealthiest families, and the way in which this tension has a decisive influence on the latter's delinquent behavior. Living in homes where there is truly no love, but rather a well-organized routine, and where parental care is limited to material goods and the act of giving things, these young people accumulate a revolt that they need to express through pranks and mischief that parents choose to ignore or consider that they are the consequences of harmful influences. The fact that they are children of rich parents only makes their devilry more elaborate: this is the case of racing with stolen cars. How many angry teenagers with rich dads continue to do similar things?\r\n\r\nExpertly directed by Nicholas Ray, the film had a high budget that allowed for quality production values. The cinematography is excellent, the sets and costumes couldn't be better (I especially liked Dean's parents' house and the abandoned mansion where part of the final scenes take place) and the cars used are beautiful. James Dean's hair and costume were decisive in youth fashion at that time, and the soundtrack accompanies everything with distinction and discretion.\r\n\r\nHowever, what decisively marks this film is the excellent quality of the cast and their work, particularly the excellent performance achieved by James Dean. He is absolutely credible in the role he was given, despite being a little older than his character. The opening scene is worthy of an anthology, but also that fight with razors that takes place near the Griffith Observatory. Natalie Wood is also not far behind: she was then more or less the right age and had the necessary talent, as well as being very beautiful and charismatic. Sal Mineo plays a highly dramatic role, and his participation in this film is one of the highlights of his career. Finally, a note of praise for Jim Backus and Marietta Canty, who made good contributions to the film in slightly less valued roles.\r\n\r\nA curious note that I just noticed: the three main actors in this film have in common the fact that they died before the age of forty-five, and each had a mysterious and violent death. Everyone knows that James Dean saw his life taken as a result of an unfortunate car accident, a few months after this film was made. However, in 1976, Sal Mineo followed, stabbed to death during a robbery at his home. A few years later, in 1981, it was the turn of Natalie Wood, who drowned in more than strange circumstances, during a yacht trip off the Californian coast."], ["_**Interesting themes, but an overrated melodrama**_\r\n\r\nReleased in late 1951 and directed by Elia Kazan based on Tennessee Williams play, \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" stars Vivien Leigh as the neurotic Blanche DuBois, who moves in with her sister (Kim Hunter) in the French Quarter of New Orleans where she is antagonized by her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley (Marlon Brando). As she seeks a relationship with one of Stanley's friends (Karl Malden) her reality crumbles around her.\r\n\r\nThe story is thematically rich and I enjoy evaluating and interpreting it. For instance, Blanche represents the dying Southern aristocracy, its airs of sophistication, its morality and delusions of superiority, whereas Stanley Kowalski represents the simple primal world of working class immigrants and the moral decay of modern society or, at least, its veneer of morality (which is the root of legalism). But the way the conflict between Blanche and Stanley plays out shows that Williams doesn't advocate either side, which leaves the audience uncertain on who to support. While Blanche's initial arrogance shouldn't be condoned and deserved rebuked, I squarely side with Blanche as Stanley's ongoing (and increasing) assaults become less and less justifiable.\r\n\r\nWhat Blanche did or didn't do with the Dubois estate is a legitimate issue of contention and the truth needed to be pursued, aggressively if necessary; but most of the other issues Stanley has with Blanche are basically none of his business. After all, everyone has shameful skeletons in their closets, even Stanley, but he's too oafish to likely ever admit it. One critic erroneously criticized Blanche for being a \"pedophile,\" but he obviously doesn't know the definition of the word. Pedophilia refers to a persistent sexual fascination with pre-pubescent kids. The worst Blanche can be accused of is ephebophilia, which is an attraction to those in their later teens, 17 and up. This condition is balanced out by her serious romantic interest in Mitch (Malden).\r\n\r\nPeople rave about Brando's acting in \"Streetcar,\" but there are far better examples of his genius, such as \"The Young Lions\" (1958), \"One-Eyed Jacks\" (1961), \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1962), \"The Missouri Breaks\" (1976) and \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979), to name a handful. Marlon's portrayal of Kowalski is undermined by the needlessly antagonistic nature of the character. In other words, the performance might be excellent, but the character is so distasteful it's hard to appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the main eye-rolling problems with the story and the movie: The characters are too one-dimensional and unbelievable. Blanche is the drama mama with airs of sophistication, Stanley is the animalistic brute, Stella is the blindly loyal wife and Mitch is the infatuated dumbaxx. Leigh's depiction of Blanche is so over-the-top and artificial it would've received a Razzie if the film were released a mere decade later. And I'm not blaming Vivien; she did the best she could with the melodramatic script.\r\n\r\nEven worse, you have ridiculous elements, like the idea that Mitch was never able to see Blanche in the full light of day, so to speak, even though he took her on a date to the pier. The whole \"dimming the lights\" component is absurd and poorly executed, especially in light of Vivien's obvious beauty, whatever her age. In reality, Mitch would (and should) be worshipping at her feet for eternity, regardless of any skeletons of her past.\r\n\r\nThen there's the preposterous explanation of the suicide of an off-screen character. In the play the reason was that he was caught in a homosexual affair, which is interesting and works (particularly considering the time period), but they changed this for the movie due to the moral codes and they failed to pull it off, to be nice.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: The movie is thematically rich and has a great cast, but the execution is seriously problematic. The story's not compelling, the characters are aggravatingly one-dimensional and there are too many eye-rolling elements. If you want to see a good Tennessee Williams movie check out 1964's \"The Night of the Iguana\" or even 1960's \"The Fugitive Kind\" (the latter has its problems, but it's better than this). The ongoing praise of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" is a good example of the emperor having no clothes.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 122 minutes (125 minutes re-release) and was shot at Warner Brothers Burbank Studios in California, with the bowling scene done in Los Angeles and the opening railway station filmed in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-", "\"I've always relied on the kindness of strangers.\" - Blanche Du Bois\r\n\r\nBlanche Dubois has had some problems back home. She rides into New Orleans on a streetcar to stay with her sister Stella and her brutish husband Stanley. It's an immediate clash of cultures as Blanche and Stanley butt heads.\r\n\r\nThough their ideology is different there is also an undeniable sexual tension around them as well. That tension continues to build to tragic effects.\r\n\r\nTo call this film one of the all time greats almost seems like an understatement. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Tennessee Williams, it ushered in a more mature dramatics that film needed. It also was important as a new kind of acting style. Marlon Brando had made the film \"The Men\" the previous year, but it was this movie that projected him to the forefront of his generation of actors. Vivian Leigh matches him as Blanche. She is strong, but incredibly fragile. Leigh, Karl Malden, and Kim Hunter all won acting Oscars.\r\n\r\nIronically the most magnetic performance of Brando was only nominated. This is probably in my Top Ten films of all time._italic text_"], ["**Larry Flynt: the man, the monster, the hero and the pervert.**\r\n\r\nAfter seeing this film, I had the feeling that I should start this text with a warning: we should not mix our opinion about Larry Flynt with our assessment of the film. I loved the film, but I'm the first to admit that I don't feel any sympathy for the biographed person. Regardless of my opinion, sex sells, people are attracted to anything that has a forbidden aroma and, even today, the magazine \u201cHustler\u201d is a success, with a television channel dedicated to adult content.\r\n\r\nThe real Larry Flynt proved to be a provocative and materialistic man: he made a fortune off the exploitation of pornographic magazines and used all means to shock people, ridicule the conservatives who criticized him, and confront society and the judicial system. He demanded to be respected, but was incapable of respecting anyone who criticized him; He used the First Amendment to defend his right to publish what he wanted, forgetting that same document when he heard criticism of what he published. Dear reader, I don't have to be a lawyer to know that the same right that protected Mr. Flynt also protected everyone who expressed a negative opinion about him within the limits of urbanity. And if it is true that freedom of expression is crucial to the democratic system, it is also true that it is not an absolute value, it must be limited in a way that protects the rights and freedoms of other people. Unfortunately, the world is full of people like Larry Flynt, who demand the right to say whatever they want, but are unable to tolerate an opinion contrary to theirs. Of course, I also don't feel any sympathy for the professional activity of Mr. Flynt, a sexist man who profited from the objectification of sex and the female body, and I am disgusted by the business he created around that magazine.\r\n\r\nHowever, the film is fantastic. Milos Forman, who accustomed us to great works full of style and personality, surprises us once again with a film that does not shy away from provoking its audience, putting its finger on the wounds that hurt the most. The director made skillful use of cinematography, environments, filming locations, sets and costumes in order to construct a narrative that explores very well Flynt's controversial and contradictory nature. For several moments, I was afraid that the script would make the mistake of beatifying or cleaning up Flynt's image. However, I truly believe that Forman managed to avoid this and give the audience a neutral narrative, where he reveals the best and worst of this complex man.\r\n\r\nThe film is reasonably discreet in its use of effects and the way it was edited, but it has a strong cast solidly based on the participation of Woody Harrelson. Looking at the finished film, I don't think I could imagine another actor better suited for the character in question. Harrelson gave himself body and soul to this project and produced one of the most consistent and powerful works of his film career, rightly deserving of an Oscar nomination. Courtney Love is perfect for the role she played, especially because the actress knew perfectly well the effects of substance abuse and was uninhibited enough to naturally face the nude scenes she was subjected to (something I tend to condemn, but I can understand, considering the film and the character) In turn, Edward Norton (at the time, experiencing a particularly radiant moment in his professional career) and Brett Harrelson make a frankly positive contribution. Richard Paul and James Cromwell also do a decent job, but they don't have the space or time to add much and seem somewhat wasted."], [], ["The western genre has gradually been making its way back into the cinematic fold. Recent dusty trail ditties such as David McKenzie's modern-day _Hell or High Water_ or Quentin Tarantino's _The Hateful Eight_ have proven to be recent saddle-tested gems that enthusiastically put cowpoke enthusiasts in movie theater seats. Furthermore, what would Hollywood do if it did not predictably invite yet another remake of a classic film into the moviegoers' mindset? Hence, director Antoine Fuqua takes a challenging stab at generating interest in his latest workman-like western shoot 'em up in the millennium-made version of **The Magnificent Seven**. \r\n\r\nNaturally, Fuqua's chaotic and calculating gun-toting actioner is an updated remake of director John Sturges's 1960 film that starred late iconic box office big stars such as Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Eli Wallach. Of course in return Sturges's borrowed his artistic gun-for-hire gumption from legendary Japanese auteur Akiro Kurosawa's vintage and influential _Seven Samurai_. Fuqua, whose gritty urban police drama _Training Day_ secured a Best Actor Oscar for his **The Magnificent Seven** leading man in two-time Academy Award winner Denzel Washington, takes on the retelling of his particular _Seven_ with feisty fury. One would not necessary anoint Fuqua's outlaw tale as a superior successor to Sturges's borrowed blueprint from Kurosawa. However, Fuqua's array of blazing bullets from his bunch of rag tag bad boys has its own distinctive sense of decorative dare and destruction that feels authentic.\r\n\r\nScreenwriters Nic Pizzolatto (\"True Detective\")and Richard Wenk deliver an unapologetic script that calls for high body counts, old-fashioned showdowns and a wild west waywardness that swaggers courtesy of Fuqua's corrosive crew. The popcorn entertainment in **The Magnificent Seven** is strictly in guilty pleasure territory so there is no need to tighten up your holsters for all you little buckaroos that are eager to wallow in Fuqua's cutthroat corral of gunslingers.   \r\n\r\nMustached bounty hunter Sam Chisolm (Washington) is the all-dressed-in-black avenger whose mission is to provide protection for the town of Rose Creek, New Mexico. In his ambitious bid to save the jeopardized Rose Creek he must assembled a group of skilled gunmen able to stand up to the diabolical powers-that-be that look to foster the on-going havoc that prevails. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, Rose Creek is under the dastardly control of the diabolical Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) that rules the town with an iron fist. The opening scene demonstrates how nefarious Bogue is at heart because he has no qualms about seizing land from its vulnerable owners or quieting down his critics with intimidating force. Basically, Bogue and his hideous henchmen are not to be reckoned with at all--unless you are willing to match wicked-minded wits with the raw and rough Chisolm and his gun-wielding renegades.\r\n\r\nRose Creek resident Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett, \"Music in Lyrics\", \"The Girl on the Train\") steps up to the plate in her effort to confront the nasty Bogue the only best way she knows how--hiring the capable and crafty collection of the Seven to contain this intimidating menace.\r\n\r\nJoining Chisolm in his bloody quest to rescue Rose Creek from Bogue's disturbing clutches are explosives expert gambler Josh Farraday (Chris Pratt), and conflicted sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke reuniting with his \"Training Day\" director and co-star Fuqua and Washington). The rest of the tag-a-longs include the outlandishly bearded Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio from TV's \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\"), Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee), Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) and Red Harvest (Martin Seinsmeier). Together, the anti-heroes known as the Magnificent Seven hope to meet the expectations of Emma's (and the town's) cause and eradicate the villainous Bogue by any means necessary.    \r\n\r\n**The Magnificent Seven** certainly does not have any pretensions about posing as a conscious-minded, revisionist western as it definitely does not have the prolific pedigree such as Clint Eastwood's _Unforgiven_ for instance. Nevertheless, the film does have a devilish impishness as its main function is to echo an exaggerated rustic feel to its throwback acknowledgement when westerns of yesteryear were just plain frivolous and furious without any particular rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nSure, the characters have really no inside depth beyond their taste for roughshod recklessness and wild tumbleweed theatrics. This is not necessarily a bad thing to consider in Fuqua's **The Magnificent Seven** because the name of the game is serving up an escapist need for its giddy-up rush for the senses. Indeed, Washington and company will not make anybody forget the aforementioned Brynner and his squad from nearly six decades ago. Still, this particular _Seven_ has its own kind of favorable punch to savor. \r\n\r\nThe notable names in _Seven_ do rise to the occasion within the context of this otherwise basic story of the wannabe borderline good guys versus the bombastic bad guys. Washington's Chisolm is solidly smooth as charismatic as the leader of the pack. Pratt's Farraday is a charming hoot as the roguish gambling cad. Hawke's Goodnight does a decent job portraying the talented gun handler simply trying to get his groove back due to his shaken confidence from a prior incident (yes, the catchy movie moniker of Goodnight Robicheaux is a keeper to say the least). And D'Onofrio's amusing Horne is deliciously irreverent. The always adventurous Sarsgaard comes to life as the vile wonder whose presence inspires the Seven to tap into vengeance mode. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the roundup it is quite clear that **The Magnificent Seven** wants to lasso its penchant for resembling a showy Hollywood western even if it is at the expense of lifting its rowdy roots from the likes of its highly regarded predecessors from golden cinema's treasured past.    \r\n\r\n**The Magnificent Seven** (2016)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 12 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Peter Sarsgaard, Haley Bennett, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung-hun Lee, Maunel Garcia Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier\r\n\r\nDirected by: Antoine Fuqua\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Western/Drama/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: ** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016", "In 1879, degenerate industrialist Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) blockades the mining town of Rose Creek, and butchers a gathering of local people drove by Matthew Cullen (Matt Bomer) when they endeavor to confront him.

But we all know the story, how it begins and how it ends, since it was the remake of the 1960 film. Actually, it was a successful remake, but not as magnificent as the original. Maybe the youngsters might like this one better.\r\n\r\nThe director's favourite, Denzel Washington in one of the main characters. Not much change in the theme, except the screenplay was little altered, especially diversity in the film characters and their developments. Because nowadays that's a big issue in Hollywood cinema. So it was led by Denzel and possibly there will be a sequel like the 'Ocean's' trilogy.\r\n\r\nThe people from a small mining town decides to hire men with guns to fight the villainous businessman who slaughtered their loved ones. The unusual seven men come together and form a team with a plan to defend the town. So what comes next is the battle between the good and the bad that lasts for the whole final act.\r\n\r\nThe setting was completely refreshing, but slightly disappointing action sequences. All the seven characters were unique and awesome, but the film lacked the great battle scene that defines each one of them. Surely I favour it just for once watch that told from the todays imagination of the 1870s era. Feels like it should have been better, but in the end it is a satisfying film.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_", "I seek righteousness.

Any number of these \"tagged classics\" have been and will become viable for remake - reboot - reimaging for newer audiences. It's here, it happens and really there's nothing we can do about it but moan amongst ourselves. John Sturges' 1960 The Magnificent Seven (itself a remake of Kurosawa pic Yojimbo) is a much loved film, and not just in Western lovers circles, it's a film that non Western fans are known to enjoy - and rightly so, it deserves its place as a \"tagged classic\" and still enthrals over 50 years since its release. So the big studio big wigs and Antoine Fuqua were taking a major gamble remaking a classic remake with their own remake!\r\n\r\nUndeniably the shadows loom large over the 2016 version, so much weight of expectation, in fact to some it was a stinker of a film even before it was released! Well, as those who have seen it will attest, both the fans and the dissenters, it hasn't raised the bar for the \"Seven\" formula, but, and this is very key here, the makers wasn't setting out to make a film that down the line would be perceived as a \"tagged classic\", and this is evident in the ream of extras available on the Blu-ray releases. They achieved what they set out to do, to make a blunderbuss Oater for the modern era to sample, and they have done it with much love, much cool and lashings of technical greatness. Add in a cast clearly enjoying themselves and not letting anyone down, and it's a tasty plate of beans.\r\n\r\nFuqua updates things by having his seven as a row of differing ethnicities, which works a treat, and crucially he and his writers are respectful of those characterisations, even if a bit more fleshing out wouldn't have gone amiss. Yet nothing is at a cost to honouring the great Westerns of old. Beautiful landscapes envelope the players, the musical score bouncing around man and nature with homaged sweetness. There's closeups, silhouetted slices of panache, superb stunt work (man and beast), glorious set design, and then there's the action. The fight sequences are excellently constructed, a feast for the eyes and ears, death and slaughter unfurled in brutal but hunger appeasing strokes. There's comic relief about the place, and while much of the dialogue wouldn't have the great poets of yore troubled, there is deepness to be found. Intelligence, too, the addition of PTSD to one of the main players is a notable piece of worth, while how wonderful to find a Western lady character of great substance (Bennett excellent), so good in fact she could have been one of the seven!\r\n\r\nIt's a bare bones story, with a pointless motive revelation tagged on for the finale, while some anachronisms will irritate those bothered by such. But if you are able to judge it on its own terms, as a Western entertainment for this era, and to accept it isn't trying to outdo the source of its inspiration, then a good time can readily be had. 8/10", "Ditches all the cerebral factors in favour of dumb fun, but hey, it works.\r\n\r\nFinal rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go.", "This is indeed a very good remake of an old classic. As always I am a bit worried when they make a remake of old classics that I liked. This remake is well worth watching though. Despite having a few minor gripes I went for 5 out of 5 stars on this one.\r\n\r\nMost of you are probably familiar with the story of The Magnificent Seven. Gunslinger gets hired to protect a village from the evil industrialist, he picks 6 buddies to help him, trains the villagers, digs in and sits down and waits for the bad guys to arrive. A simple and well suited story for a bit of Western entertainment. I guess I should mention as well that the original Western is actually not the \u201creal\u201d original. That honor befalls Shichinin no samurai, or Seven Samurai in English, which is a Samurai movie by Akira Kurosawa and with Toshir\u00f4 Mifune in the lead role. That is the movie from which the plot originates.\r\n\r\nAnyway, history lesson is over, back to this movie. The movie starts of by introducing the main characters. The bad industrialist is a nasty piece of thug and quickly demonstrates that, although by no means being a blood splatter movie, it is definitely more cruel than what I remember from the original. Next in line is the movies hero played by Denzel Washington and I have to say that he plays the role very well. I liked him as the calm, fairly silent, but oh so deadly gunslinger from the first frame to the last.\r\n\r\nThe other characters fit quite well into their roles as well. I cannot make up my mind about Jack Horne though. I did like the character but at the same time I felt that he was a wee bit to comical at times. I also liked Goodnight Robicheaux quite a lot but the writer really went a bit over the top as far as I am concerned when he actually left.\r\n\r\nOf course the entire movie plays out as a build up to the final big fight and it is a big fight, that has to be said. However there are plenty of things happening during this build up. Both things involving chemically propelled slugs flying around and things slightly less noisy.\r\n\r\nSam Chisolm has to pick up his buddies of course, each one being an opportunity for some cool movie story telling. Then we have the training of the villagers which, as expected, becomes a wee bit comical at times. Oh, and I almost forget that there is a nice little shootout when Chisolm and his buddies introduces themselves to Bogue\u2019s thugs in the village. Said thugs includes the local Sheriff. To no ones surprise I believe. So much for law and order. Time for a new management.\r\n\r\nSo, fast forward to the end and the big fight. It is big, it is well done and it involves plenty of things that go boom. It is plenty of action but it is also the part of the movie where I have the biggest gripe. Okay folks there are going to be a mild spoiler now. With that out of the way, let\u2019s go to the Gatling gun. It is always cool to see a Gatling gun let loose. However can we keep it a bit more realistic please? They fire thousands of bullets without reloading (they make a fuss about reloading later in the movie). Also they position the gun out in the open where it would have been relatively easy to shoot the men operating it. An idea that they finally get much later and manage to goof up. The final solution to taking out the gun is dramatic but quite convoluted. This is the part of the movie that made me go a bit what the fuck!\r\n\r\nApart from that I really enjoyed this movie. A good remake of an old classic.", "My only objection with this version is the use of the Gatling gun. Though I know it's only a movie and it creates more excitement, the gun never fired that many rounds per load. That said, I still enjoyed the movie.", "***Muscular Western headed by Denzel Washington is superior to the hokey original***\r\n\r\nA woman (Haley Bennett) seeking justice after the murder of her husband enlists a bounty hunter (Denzel Washington), who gathers six others, to defend the woman\u2019s southwestern town against a ruthless army hired by a destructive industrialist (Peter Sarsgaard). Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung-Hun Lee, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo and Martin Sensmeier play the other six gunfighters.\r\n\r\n\"The Magnificent Seven\" (2016) is a reimagining of the 1960 Western, which itself was based on Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai\" (1954). While the plot is contrived the original version had a stellar cast, a magnificent score and great locations, but it was ruined by hokey script flaws. For instance, the teen Chico (Buchholz) was able to effortlessly infiltrate Calvera's bandits, utterly fooling them, even though there were only 32 of them by this point (rolling my eyes). Even if Calvera & his brigands failed to make out Chico's face, which is a big IF, his dialogue & accent would've given him away. Keep in mind that Chico was just an unseasoned teen.\r\n\r\nAnother example is the villagers' sudden cowardly turnaround (betrayal), which totally contradicted their earlier resolve. Yes, I realize they learned that the bandits weren't run-off and that they were going to return to the village out of desperation, but there were only like 30-32 bandits left at this juncture and the combined forces of the seven gunmen and the fighting villagers now had the opportunity to annihilate the thugs for good.\r\n\r\nThis version of course eliminates such idiotic writing and ups the ante with the action. The movie's bloody, but no more so than recent Westerns like \"3:10 to Yuma\" (2007) and \"Django Unchained\" (2012). If you like those ones, as well as oldies like \u201cDuel at Diablo\u201d (1966) and \u201cThe Outlaw Josey Wales\u201d (1976), you\u2019ll like this one. Washington stands tall in the main role while Jennifer Lawrence lookalike Haley Bennett is stunning and superior to Lawrence. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in Arizona, New Mexico and one shot in Colorado (Miller Mesa, Ridgway) with the main set being in Jackson, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "**These magnificent seven are politically correct and historically inaccurate, but still far more fun than any sequel to the first film.**\r\n\r\n\u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d \u2013 the original film \u2013 was a remake of a Japanese production, and ended up being followed by an unnecessary and rather poor succession of sequels. Only the Japanese original and the early American film remain for posterity, which is a classic in its own right. What we have here turns out to be a remake of the remake, and despite its many merits, it doesn't make us forget our first love.\r\n\r\nThe film has two big points in its favor: the production, luxurious and detailed, and the quality of the cast involved. The script presents the same story that we already know, but structured differently and with different types of actors, in addition to being entirely in the USA, and not in Mexico. That was another point in its favor, as the story of the first film had already been virtually copied, chewed up and dismantled by the sequels that followed.\r\n\r\nI liked the work of Denzel Washington, an impeccable actor and perfectly comfortable with action movies. Ethan Hawke is very supportive and does some quality solo work as well. Haley Bennett is also excellent. Chris Pratt, Vincent d'Onofrio, Lee Byung-Hun and all the others help, but they don't capture our interest or really stand out. Peter Sarsgaard, the villain, did a good job considering the weaknesses of the material received: the character appears little, has almost nothing to do and, in the end, inside the church, he has a behavior that does not match anything that had happened so far. there.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film features a huge amount of effects-laden action and high-quality CGI. Antoine Fuqua knew how to understand how the film should be, honoring its predecessor without, however, copying it. The film has excellent effects, good costumes and good sets. The production paid attention to the period details, which does not prevent some minor anachronisms, which were not a substantial problem. The action scenes were well executed and the film will certainly please fans of the genre, and the soundtrack has a certain epic flavor that goes well and harmonizes well with the (already historic) musical theme of the film, which was rerecorded for the new production.\r\n\r\nThese are all qualities, and minor flaws. Where I really feel that the film failed was in the casting of some of the actors. After the recent controversies in the industry (which involved not only the infamous accusations of harassment, but also the discrimination of professionals based on color or ethnicity), there was an effort to counteract bad publicity with actors who were black, Native American or Latinos in all sorts of characters. I'm not against it, but I think there are characters better suited to it than others, and I doubt, for example, that a Native American would pair well with a group of mostly white gunslingers in the late 19th century. As much as political correctness is appeased, it is an idea that goes against historical verisimilitude. Another problem with this film is the attempts to introduce humor, both in the situations and in the dialogues: they are so bad and so shaky that it would be better if they had removed them from the final version."], ["This is obviously an epic film, lasting nearly four hours with the wide, sweeping desert vistas and huge cast. It describes a fairly brief period of time out of a remarkable man\u2019s life. I wonder how modern viewers handle the length of the movie, accustomed as they are to  movies this lengthy featuring superheroes with humor and almost constant action.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t even remember how long ago I originally watched Lawrence of Arabia \u2014quite possibly forty or more years ago. It has aged pretty well overall. The only negative thing that struck me when I recently re-watched it may well be due to my age. But it can be a talkative film at times, which is fine, but they sometimes talk fairly softly, and if such a scene transitions to music, I found the music to be so loud in comparison that it lifted me half of my chair. I had to have remote in hand to be ready to adjust the volume. A minor thing."], ["Bruno Ganz is on top form in this characterful study of desire - physical and spiritual. He is \"Daniel\" an angel invisible to all but his own kind (and to the innocence of children) who finds himself, with his colleague \"Cassiel\" (Otto Sander) policing the city of Berlin at the end of the second world war. Needless to say, there are no shortages of claimants on their compassion and they do what they can to help assuage the difficulties faced by the desperate and the struggling. When he alights on circus trapeze artiste \"Marion\" (Solveig Dommartin) though, \"Daniel\" starts to have doubts. His entire raison d'\u00eatre starts to become compromised as he realises that there are benefits to being mortal, and human, and that being in love is probably the greatest of these. Up until this moment, his life has been intangible and he determines that must change. It's risky though... There are no guarantees! It's a bit of a slow burn so don't expect a great deal to happen quickly. It is, however, quite a potent tale of realising priorities and dealing with demons - some more apparent than others - told in a gradually accumulating, effective and emotionally charged manner. It is not in the least sentimental but just as the angels observe their subjects, we are invited by Wim Wenders to do the same with them - and it's surprisingly effective to watch as some of the questions and challenges facing him could easily be applied to those in the audience. The monochrome photography is also striking and well authenticates the scenario of a desolate and despairing post war environment. Perhaps serendipity takes too big an hand at the end, but... you decide.", "**Essay on Sleepiness.**\r\n\r\nWhen I decided to see this film, I did it for three reasons: the first is the participation of Bruno Ganz, a German actor that I appreciate and that I started to like after seeing him do excellent work in other films such as \u201cThe Fall\u201d; the second is the enormous consideration in which this film has been held by a very high number of distinguished critics and specialists; the third is the fact that it's the first West German film I've seen in my life (as far as I know and that I'm aware of).\r\n\r\nThe script, however, couldn't be more tasteless than it turns out to be: the film begins with the turns and wanderings of two angels through the streets and places of West Berlin, observing people's daily lives. Damiel and Cassiel, each in their own way, are interested in human beings. They cannot be seen, except for children, and for a single individual who manages to talk to them, and one of them ends up deciding to become a human being and live a mortal life, on Earth, after falling in love with a woman. circus trapeze artist.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is no lack of television or literary material about angels who fall in love with humans or who, for other reasons, give up their angelic life and become humans. It seems that there is, among us, a desire to humanize these creatures. In the wake of all this, the film makes a series of philosophical and metaphysical considerations that will only truly interest philosophers, or theologians, or writers in general. Wim Wenders is a director who appreciates this type of ultra-intellectual cinema, made for artistic cycles and festivals, never for the general public, who find it a good substitute for sleeping pills. Personally, I don't like this type of cinema, even though I recognize its artistic merit.\r\n\r\nBruno Ganz, on his journey, awakens to the beauty of humanity in an elegant way that borders on poetry. He sees beauty in the most trivial things, which we usually don't, not without an extreme artistic sensitivity that the common individual rarely cultivates. The actor couldn't be more competent in the work he does, and is skilfully assisted by Otto Sander, who has another angelic role. Solveig Dommartin and Peter Falk are also very good additions, with time to show value.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this film is really the excessively slow and cold way in which it unfolds and gradually exposes itself. The pace of the film is so slow that it becomes boring, and I confess that I didn't pay much attention to the permanent monologues. Things improve a lot when Falk enters the scene, giving movement to a bloodless and soporific plot. The closing credits, in German expressionist style, make a direct allusion to the cinematographic past of the city, and of the country, something that Wenders may have done as a tribute, or asserting himself as a continuer of the legacy of the past (which is not as modest as the first idea). Almost the entire film is shot in black-and-white, with cinematography that is very well achieved and worthy of merit. Colors are introduced later, becoming more associated with humanity, that is, with the way we see the world we live in. Original, well thought out. The film does not have a great soundtrack, betting more on monologues and very boring dialogues. Furthermore, the film is practically a city tour of West Berlin, a metropolis that has changed radically in recent years, as we know.

The Third Man, it's a masterpiece by jove. 10/10", "Joseph Cotton (\"Holly\") arrives in post war Vienna to meet up with his former school friend \"Harry Lime\" - only to discover that he was recently killed in an automobile accident. Without his promised job, he starts to chat with the friends of the dead man and swiftly spots some inconsistencies that lead him to become suspicious. He determines to try and find out just quite what happened. It becomes harder and harder for \"Holly\" to get straight answers - even from those whom he ought to be able to rely upon - \"Maj. Calloway\" (Trevor Howard) nor even \"Anna\" (Alida Valli), the dead man's lover - seem to be able (or willing to help). Gradually, also, he begins to suspect that he is being followed. Pinpricks of light from cigarettes in the shadows, shifting bodies hugging the dimly lit doorways - and he begins to realise that maybe his friend was not quite as scrupulous and honourable as he might have wished or appeared. Right from Anton Karas playing the distinctive zither theme at the top of the film we are treated to a wonderfully evocative adaptation of Graham Greene's mystery thriller and Carol Reed really does well with the pace of this too. We do make progress, but \"Holly\" has to work hard - as do we - for it, and his shady protagonists remain in the shadows, really effectively. This is a super story of trust, loyalty and greed that really is still as good now as it was 70 years ago.", "**Can a good movie be spoiled by an inadequate soundtrack? It can, and this film is proof of that.**\r\n\r\nI like film noir a lot, and I saw this film with pleasure. It's one of those films that you can't miss: it has an excellent story, complex characters, a lot of suspense and a good dose of humor, very elegant, almost intertwined with the main story, where we have a young American writer trying to unravel the very poorly explained death. from a friend in the half-ruined city that was Vienna in the years after World War II. The local police, rather than helping, seem to be part of the problem and, as he progresses in the investigations, there are more and more indicants of a crime.\r\n\r\nThe film is very good and is very well directed by Carol Reed. The most common aspects of noir are all there: the light, the dense shadows, the tense and dark urban environment, a crime, many potential suspects and criminals, an apparently corrupt police and an elegant young woman who steals hearts, but it may not be so innocent as it looks. The film doesn't let us down for a minute and gives us exactly what we want to see and feel, and that's truly satisfying.\r\n\r\nTo make things even better, we have good sets and believable costumes, a good use of exterior scenes and a city that, even destroyed, never loses its beauty and elegance. The cinematography couldn't be better, the camera work is worthy of being studied in film schools, and the effects are used sparingly and effectively. The cast is truly competent: despite being the most resonant name, Orson Welles is not the most visible actor. Still young and relatively good-looking (he would put on more weight in the following years, as we know), the actor appears little, but steals our attention whenever he appears. Joseph Cotten is the real protagonist of the film, and he does his job equally well. He is one of those actors that is forgotten today, but he deserves a lot that his work is reviewed and revisited.\r\n\r\nThe only thing, and it's really just that, that brings this film down is its soundtrack and insistence on a mandolin theme that couldn't be more inappropriate. It could even have been used as an opening theme, during the credits, but no\u2026 the annoying music intrudes throughout the film to the point of being unbearable. It sounds like a melody made for a Marx Brothers movie, and it doesn't stop here! It's truly annoying and cuts the mood of the movie!"], ["One of the most iconic Allen's movie. Funny and quite believable but I think I was expecting something else.", "***Talky romcom with Woody Allen and Diane Keaton is consistently amusing***\r\n\r\nA twice-divorced neurotic stand-up comedian in New York City (Woody Allen) details his perspective on life and his relationship with the scatterbrained Annie Hall (Diane Keaton).\r\n\r\nThe best movie I\u2019ve seen by Woody Allen is the excellent \u201cMatch Point\u201d (2005), but that was a crime drama/romance/thriller whereas a lot of his films are talky romantic dramedies, which is the case with \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d (1977), winner of Best Picture and other awards at the AA. Was it worthy of all the accolades and does it hold up? Well, I laughed consistently if that tells you anything.\r\n\r\nThe movie uses techniques that were probably innovative when it was released in 1977, like Annie\u2019s immaterial essence doing something else why her body\u2019s in bed with Alvy (Allen). The dialogue-driven approach is refreshing (today, that is) and the way Alvy sometimes breaks the fourth wall is amusing. I also enjoyed seeing the mid-70s period in the background, like \u201cMessiah of Evil\u201d (1973) on the marquee and a billboard featuring DESTROYER-era KISS.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot in New York City & Long Island and the Los Angeles area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "Stand-up comic \"Alvy\" (Woody Allen) has a lively history with the women in his life. His marriages - of which there have been two - have all ended rather suddenly, as has his latest dalliance with the eponymous singer (Diane Keaton) who won't have sex with him unless she gets high first! Now this latest failure perplexes him. He thinks that over the years he would have managed to iron out the frailties in his character and so, by now, be able to retain the affections of a woman. What keeps going wrong? Woody Allen did pretty much everything on this production so is able to well focus the self-deprecating Jewish humour that threads through the feature as well as using the retrospective nature of the story telling to quite amusingly but also entirely plausibly assess not just \"Alvy\" but what scenarios from his life, loves, upbringing and choices helped mould the man into that rather flawed creature we now see before us. At times it is a little wordy, and he does recourse to in-jokes once or twice too many, but for the most part this is a confidently pitched double-hander with two actors who have an unique sort of on/off on-screen chemistry that makes this an engaging and enjoyable ninety minutes that might well ring true in many a bedroom.", "**A good romantic comedy, with flaws and virtues, that didn't deserve four Oscars. Despite that, it deserves the appreciation of fans of this movie genre.**\r\n\r\nWoody Allen is one of those directors that many people love, many people can't stand, and many people find just stupid. I've seen some of his films that I liked, and I've seen others that I hated, and I can understand why he is one of those who have never been able to assert himself and have a consensual recognition.\r\n\r\nThe film is a romantic comedy based on the relationship of a couple played by Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. They like each other, but they can't make the relationship work harmoniously. Of course, this leads to funny and embarrassing situations. Released in the aftermath of the \u201csexual revolution\u201d, the film tackles the topic of sexuality bluntly and they openly discuss it. I don't know if it's necessary to say, but the dialogues are an important feature of the film, and the two characters are talking almost all the time.\r\n\r\nOne of the strengths of the film is its apparent simplicity and elegance: it is a simple film, so simple and apparently cheap that it smells of indie. There are no complicated visual effects, the cinematography is functional and has good lighting, the sets are very realistic, simple and pragmatic, everyone seems to be wearing their own clothes... And in the center of the spotlight is the acting couple in a magnificent work. They don't even look like they're there playing characters, they just look like themselves!\r\n\r\nHowever, it is far from being a problem-free film. Sex is a topic approached in a sincere way, but it dominates their discussions, it is so omnipresent that it ends up being tiring, like those people who are always talking about the same thing and do not shut up or change the subject. Allen's style of humor is also far from leading to consensus: some like it, say it is informal, brilliant in its simplicity, and others already consider it simply stupid, tasteless and, at times, offensive.\r\n\r\nThe film was one of the great winners of the 1977 Oscars, and that for many people is something. In my opinion, I think Diane Keaton deserved the Oscar for Best Actress, she does a remarkable job. Likewise, I think the film deserved the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, the film's story and dialogues justifies it well, but Allen did not deserve the Oscar for Best Director, which would have been more justly given to George Lucas, also nominated for the first film of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d saga. And since these two films competed for the Oscar for Best Picture, it's really hard to understand how this film won the award. I think that even Allen fans accept that \u201cStar Wars\u201d deserved the statuette and that the academy just didn't want to do it because it was a sci-fi movie. Now, let's get to the point: is the movie good, is it really worth it? Of course, it's a subjective answer, depending on what you like. People who like romantic comedies with a lot of dialogue will enjoy it, but others can skip it without feeling like they've really lost anything by doing it."], ["_**Life on a German U-boat**_\r\n\r\nDuring WW2, the German submarine U-96 (with J\u00fcrgen Prochnow as the captain) leaves the French harbor of La Rochelle for war adventures & misfortunes in the North Atlantic when they\u2019re eventually commissioned to go through the Strait of Gibraltar. The men experience the challenging claustrophobic life of serving on a U-boat with its highs and lows. Who will make it back alive?\r\n\r\n\u201cDas Boot\u201d (1981) is a well done accounting of what it was like to live on a U-boat in WW2 \u2013 the claustrophobic living conditions, boredom, filth, sheer terror and\u2026 no women. One great scene is when the submarine surfaces after torpedoing a couple ships in a British convoy; it\u2019s like hell came to Earth.\r\n\r\nThe flick focuses on the Germans in the restricted spaces of the U-boat and it\u2019s amazing that a compelling film can be made from that limited dramatic angle. While this is a war picture, it doesn\u2019t glorify war. It\u2019s \u201canti-war\u201d simply by showing the way it was for sub-mariners. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 29 minutes, and was shot in North Sea near Heligoland; the Atlantic Ocean; La Rochelle, France; and Bavaria, Germany.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "\"Das Boot\" stands out as a masterful epic of war cinema, not just for its thrilling combat sequences but for its in-depth look at the human element of warfare. Wolfgang Petersen's direction brings to life the claustrophobic world of a German U-boat, filled with men who are far more than the enemy caricatures often depicted in war films. Jurgen Prochnow's performance as the Captain is especially noteworthy, bringing a palpable sense of leadership, humanity, and burden.\r\n\r\nThe film's slow pacing allows for an immersive experience, making viewers feel a part of the crew's long, tense moments of silence followed by the chaos of battle. The technical details and the psychological depth explored in the characters break down the traditional barriers of war movies, showing the crew as skilled, complex individuals rather than one-dimensional soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"Das Boot\" is a powerful, nuanced, and visually arresting film that captures the futility, dread, and sometimes the mundanity of war. It's a unique perspective that offers a gripping narrative and an emotionally resonant experience, making it a classic in both war and world cinema.\""], ["Burt Lancaster is the multi-millionaire oil magnate \"Felix Happer\" who despatches one of his minions (Peter Riegert) to Scotland to buy up a village to turn it into an oil refinery. Once he arrives, he is taken for a bit of a ride by the canny locals as they try to milk him for as much cash as they can. In the days before cell phones; he has to call his boss from the phone box reporting his lack of progress and some astronomical sightings until eventually Happer comes over himself and immediately strikes up a rapport with Fulton Mackay who lives on the beach (and who is steadfastly refusing to sell). It is is simple story very well told with a slightly unpredictable, happy ending and a brilliant score from Mark Knopfler.", "**Slow, with boring characters and dialogues and a disjointed script, this film does not justify the \u201chype\u201d around it.**\r\n\r\nThis is one of those indie films that has won over a legion of self-confessed admirers. It's a film that everyone speaks highly of, as if it were a solid masterpiece. I didn't know that when I saw it for the first time, so I saw it without a lot of expectations. I'm glad I did it: despite recognizing some merits, I am convinced that the film has been well overrated. The proof is the way it fell into oblivion! If we exclude fans and movie nerds who know everything (and when they don't, they make it up) who really remembers this movie?\r\n\r\nThe film revolves around a story that is very simple: in the north of Scotland, there is a small bay with a beach and a sleepy village. When a rich oil entrepreneur decides to buy all that to build a huge refinery and a terminal for oil tankers, all those people are expectant, wanting to sell what they have for the best price. Only two people disagree: a marine biologist who want to preserve and study the local, and an old simpleton who owns a good part of that beach.\r\n\r\nThe film had some potential, but it lacks solidity and a good script. Time is spent in sterile dialogue, rambling about comets, constellations and flirting. It is also very unbelievable, as a project like this would never be so consensual, there are always those who oppose it for financial or ecological reasons, or mere nostalgia.\r\n\r\nIf director Bill Forsyth decided to close his eyes to the insipidity and fragility of the script, he was equally inept at using the actors. The cast is good, but he didn't know how to use it. Peter Riegert does what he can, but he has absolutely no charisma and is a forgettable protagonist, who seems more uncomfortable with his character than his character with fieldwork, far from the comforts of the office. Peter Capaldi doesn't do it better, and Jenny Seagrove is just a pretty face here. Fulton Mackay manages to give us something more substantial, but he has little screen time, and the same can be said of poor Burt Lancaster, who is removed from the screen for a good time.\r\n\r\nA disjointed script, insipid dialogues purposely created to fill up time, characters without strength and ability to captivate us\u2026 could there be something in the technical aspects that saves this film? Yes. The cinematography is very good, making the best use of the beauties of the Highlands. The sets and costumes are quite good, and the soundtrack is atmospheric and pleasant. Is it enough to justify the hype around this film and consider it a magnificent and exceptional work? I don't think so."], ["Having seen this four or five times now since I was a kid, I can definitively say this is the best Woody Allen introduction for newcomers. Visually it's his best work (for those who don't know, the cinematographer Gordon Willis did The Godfather Parts 1 & 2 earlier the same decade, so it's no surprise). Not as insightful or engrossing as Hannah or Misdemeanors, but the writing's up there. Mariel Hemingway's a crown jewel and tears me apart. If you're a newbie and can watch this before Annie Hall I highly recommend it. It's aged much better and is _the_ Woody Allen litmus test", "**In the shadow of \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d.**\r\n\r\nI decided to watch this film last week, after the visit that Woody Allen himself made to my country, with his jazz band and an interesting lecture at the National Cinematheque for invitations only. Despite having seen several of the director's films and not even considering him bad, he always seemed overvalued to me. He won the Oscar for Best Director and was nominated for the award a few times, but after \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d he seems to have made several films using the same premise and based, exclusively, on couples with problems.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d, I found it difficult to watch this film without feeling that Allen was plagiarizing himself and using the same formula to try to achieve the same success. For the intended purpose, it was a success, and it is difficult to find a professional critic who would say that \u201cManhattan\u201d is poor, a chewed-up copy of a good film that earned Woody Allen the golden statuette. But that's what I feel, and professional critics and Allen fans forgive me, if they can.\r\n\r\nIn the film, Allen almost seems to play himself, in a similar way to what we saw in \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d and which also includes, as usual, unorthodox humor and an apparent pleasure in talking about sex. Diane Keaton does a very well done job and is, by far, the best actress here, but even that ends up not being a complete justification for seeing this film instead of others, much better, by the same director. The auxiliary actors don't help much: they want to appear and be part of the project, and that seems to be enough for them.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has some points of value: considering this director's musical ear, it doesn't surprise me that the soundtrack is one of the points where Allen wanted to leave a mark of personal taste. And since he is a born New Yorker, it is clear that the film is a labor of love in which we see the affection that Allen has for his homeland, which he is prevented from visiting due to legal issues. Manhattan was lovingly treated, appearing in all its mythical and fascinating splendor, and George Gershwin's music could not be better chosen and more pleasant. All the editing works very well, even if the film is a little slow. There's only one thing I don't understand: why did Allen decide to film in black and white and with so much grain? The question remains unanswered."], ["The answer my friend is a hat blowing in the wind.\r\n\r\nThe Coen brothers craft a loving homage to gangster pictures of yore with splendid results. Essentially the plot has Gabriel Byrne as a good - bad guy caught between two rival gangster factions. It's a standard story line that is still providing cinematic water for many a film maker these days, but shot through the Coen prism, with literary astuteness holding court, it's a genre piece of considerable class. A picture in fact that gets better and better with further viewings.\r\n\r\nWhen the Coen's are on form they have the skills to make a grade \"A\" thriller and blend it with a sort of dry irony. It's like they bite the hand that feeds whilst praising said genre influences to the rafters, but it works as damn fine entertainment. On a narrative level Miller's Crossing molds the byzantine with the labyrinthine, keeping the complexities just on the right side of the street from that of art for arts sake.\r\n\r\nVisually the film is superb, the hard working sweat of the city dovetails impudently with the mother nature beauty of Miller's Crossing the place, a place home to misery, a witness to the dark side of man. All the while Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro and Jon Polito bring an array of characterisations to the party, each one his own man but each craftily proving the folly of man. Marcia Gay Harden, in one of her first mainstream roles, slinks about making the two main boys sweaty, and wonderful she is as well. While Carter Burwell provides a musical score that has a smug (in a good way) self awareness about it.\r\n\r\nStyle over substance? Yes, on formative viewings it is. But go back, look again, see and sample what is not being said. Pulpers and noirers will I'm sure get the gist. 8/10", "Gabriel Byrne is \"Reagan\", the enforcer for the pretty ruthless mob kingpin \"Leo\" (Albert Finney). He is caught in the middle of a battle between his boss and the man who would take his place \"Caspar\" (John Polito) over the antics of a rogue bookie \"Bernie\" (the scene-stealing John Turturro) who also happens to be the brother of \"Verna\" (Marcia Gay Harden) - the girlfriend of Leo, oh - and the mistress of \"Reagan\" too. \"Reagan\" tries to be a bit of an honest broker between them all, but when his efforts fail, he is cast aside by his former boss and left to fend for himself... On the face of it, this is just a run-of-the-mill gangster film. People are killed and the vicious circle of revenge continues. Quite cleverly, though, the Coen brothers have done quite a bit to present more complex characters and to give the plot a little more quirkiness - and that makes this an interesting two hours to watch. Finney's accent is a bit hit or miss, and I'm afraid Byrne just isn't a strong enough actor to carry his substantial part so well - he is no Edward G. Robinson or George Raft, but this is still a superior delve into the murky world of organised crime that does bear watching."], ["Fantastic movie with great cast and a thrilling story. Bogart performs great.", "I wanted something very special to be my 5,000th film (at least to my horrible memory and to my stats on IMDb), and so after brazen and intense thought, I decided on a later-than-expected watch of a classic from Bogart's association with John Huston. I say later than expected because I bought the immaculate 24-film Humphrey Bogart Collection, which was supposed to have it on its 12 double-sided DVDs, but it accidentally had, in its place, the special features disc, which held excellent feature-length documentaries on both John Huston and the making of the film. Thus I waited until recently, when I found the blu for a very good price and went for it.\r\n\r\nIt was worth the wait. The ultimate tale of sordid greed. Without going into detail or spoilers, everyone got exactly what they deserved. My only qualm is that after a splendid cameo by the director (whom when I think of that aspect of his career, I will always fondly think of 'Chinatown'), I was hoping we'd end up seeing more of his character. That would have been even more wonderful for me.\r\n\r\nHopefully I will see and rate another 5,000--and I'm very curious if and when I do, what film I'll choose for THAT milestone...", "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a film whose pleasures lie in the \u2018how\u2019 as opposed to the \u2018what.\u2019 Not long into the movie, Howard (Walter Huston) spells out the plot in broad strokes: \u201cNever knew a prospector yet that died rich \u2026 going with a partner or two is dangerous. Murder's always lurkin' about. Partners accusin' each other of all sorts of crimes \u2026 as long as there's no find, the noble brotherhood will last, but when the piles of gold begin to grow, that's when the trouble starts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe movie then unfolds with all the inevitability of a Greek tragedy (with Howard doing Cassandra one better, because not even he heeds his own prediction). The story\u2019s destination thus secured, writer/director John Huston doesn\u2019t rush headlong for the finish line; on the contrary, he takes the time to establish the characters and the situation at his leisure, with lots of patience and a smattering of humor (including a scene where Bogie throws water in the face of an infant Robert Blake).\r\n\r\nAfter the three protagonists \u2013 Howard, Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart), and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) \u2013 climb up the titular mountains and Dobbs climbs down from sanity, everything goes pretty much according to Howard\u2019s forecast \u2013 which is to say, spectacularly wrong, but spectacular nonetheless; Dobbs becomes paranoid and delusional, convinced that the other two are either going to stab him in the back or ambush him down the line \u2013 but never just shoot him on the spot, because they are \u201cyellow.\u201d\r\n\r\nEven at his most heroic, Bogie had an underlying mean streak; Rick Blaine is a cynical, bitter drunk who is, as one can only be in the movies, Saved by the Love of a Good Woman (even if he doesn\u2019t Get the Girl in the End), and Sam Spade is always looking out for No. 1. It\u2019s in films like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (see also Conflict, In a Lonely Place) that he lets loose that inner darkness which he only taps into elsewhere, and his descent into madness remains the best part of a great movie (and even then Huston finds room for humor, such as when Dobbs asks an interloper \u201cwho\u2019s not civilized?!\u201d right before sucker punching him).", "**An excellent film that deserves to be remembered today, more than seventy years later.**\r\n\r\nIt's curious to see a film where a group of Americans go to Mexico to experience in Mexican lands what many Mexicans now go through in the USA: hunger, unemployment and difficulties in surviving. However, this is how this film begins, which presents us with a group of three Americans with no prospects for improving their lives who decide to invest everything in a treasure hunt by becoming gold prospectors in the most remote mountains of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe film continues with Americans surviving various hardships and revealing the worst of themselves due to gold fever, a type of greed that affects those who seek to get rich quickly by mining the most coveted metals in the world. There is no doubt that it is a very good film and that it treats the characters in a very careful way, with each one making a very interesting psychological and moral evolution. Therefore, it is perhaps one of the best works of the career of Humphrey Bogart, one of the most notable actors of the golden age of cinema. The way he worked on this film is impressive. Tim Holt is not far behind, however his character has a different evolution. Walter Huston also does a good job here.\r\n\r\nThe film is really worth it: the story is good, John Huston's direction is competent and effective, the black and white cinematography is very beautiful and elegant, the sets are well done, and the costumes also leave nothing to be desired.

Based on the real accounts of allied soldiers escaping en mass from a German POW camp back in 1942, the film is involving from start to finish, due in the main to the wonderful array of characters on show. We follow them from the moment they arrive at the camp right through to the stunning climax, and it is with great joy I say that none of the cast lets the side down, they all do great work for the astute and undervalued Sturges. A number of great set pieces align with Elmer Bernstein's fabulous score to  never let the blood settle, and in among the cheeky slices of humour is palpable tension to make this simply one of the best films of its type, in fact one of the best films ever.\r\n\r\nSturges and his writers, James Clavell & W.R. Burnett, adapt from the book written by Paul Brickhill, someone who speaks from experience having been one of the prisoners of super POW camp Stalag Luft III, which of course is what The Great Escape is born from. Sturges was fascinated by the story and after trying without fail for over a decade to get it onto the screen, he finally succeeded. The success three years earlier of his star ensemble Western, The Magnificent Seven, enabled Sturges to realise his vision, the result of which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year.\r\n\r\nThe cast is made up of notable thespians and iconic heroes. Steve McQueen (enticing the American audience in one feels), Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Donald, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, James Garner, David McCallum, John Leyton and Gordon Jackson. Which of course is a pretty tidy roll call, but the input and impact of Hannes Messemer as the Camp Commandant, Colonel Von Luger should not be understated. His scenes have a real humanistic quality that shows a softer side of Germany to the one ruled by a certain despot (the finale here offering up the counter opposite of the war), the writers smartly, and rightly, not tarring a nation with the same old brush.\r\n\r\nA wonderful involving movie that puts characteristic heart in bed with the action and suspense laden plot. 10/10", "I can't watch this any more.

Steve McQueen forms an unlikely alliance with Angus \"the Mole\" Lennie; James \"the scrounge\" Garner with the expert, tea-drinking, forger Donald Pleasance whose eyesight is failing rapidly; Charles Bronson and James Coburn and a whole raft of seasoned British actors bring this whole enterprise to life in a gritty, sometimes amusing, but ultimately determined way. Hannes Messemer \"The Kommandant\" also deserves mention as he seems to still cling to some of the basic tenets of human decency as he tries to stop the Gestapo from implementing their more drastic solutions.

Directed by Michael Cimino, this 3-hour film takes its time developing these characters and shows the psychological side of the horrors of Vietnam, and war in general. Probably makes a good companion film with Apocalypse Now, released only seven months later (in the U.S.). **4.5/5**", "Did Michael Cimino ever make another movie? I wouldn't be surprised if not after this harrowing and intense look at the human psyche after it's exposure to the brutalities of war. The war was in Vietnam, and the protagonists here are those who survived - to varying degrees - to return home to what they hope will be some sort of normality. To some semblance of what they left behind. To some humanity. The three men all come from an Ohio sawmill town via some Eastern Europe antecedence, and they willingly enlist to fight for their country \"Michael\" (Robert De Niro), \"Nicky\" (Christopher Walken) and \"Steven\" (John Savage). It's the latter man who has just got married and so who feels a great wrench when they are almost summarily deployed. That deployment sees them captured, tortured and exposed to the most deadly game of Russian roulette you're ever likely to witness. The narrative now splices a little so we can follow the three character's individual experiences in escaping and trying to get home. The way the threads weave here is hugely impactful on the presentation of the story to the audience. The characterful efforts - especially from Savage, and a really taut and considered direction allow us to observe the impact of the conflict not just on the men - physically, emotionally and psychologically; but on those left behind. Those epitomised by \"Linda\" (Meryl Streep) whose needs are torn between loyalty to those absent and need for comfort from those not. It's not meant to be an history, cinematic licence abounds. This is essentially a darkly written observation of the consequences of war, or trauma and of loyalty. It could be about any war. These are not soldiers, they are barely-trained young men in uniform and the plot could just as readily apply to any other people drafted in to fight for a cause they didn't understand in a place they'd probably never heard of. Does it need to be three hours long? My jury is out on that. It does allow itself to meander at times, but the more I watch it the more I wonder if Cimino hasn't built in some necessary steam valves for us to rest from the intensity of the characterisations here. The intensity of the photography and Stanley Myers score - with some almost incongruous help from the guitar themed \"Cavatina\" by (the other) John Williams makes this as must for a big screen, makes you think a bit and certainly offers career best roles from Walken and Savage."], ["Jim Jarmusch's work can be either intimidating or off-putting, and in equal measure, to cinephiles because it feels so relaxed--almost as if it was a spur-of-the-moment, off-the-cuff precursor of reality-TV, an inside-joke with everyone involved slipping a nod and a wink, as if on a drunken dare, a mickey of JD passed back and forth along with a pack of Marlboros. This brought to mind many good memories of one of the oddest residents of The Criterion Collection: 'Fishing with John' (an exemplary and hilarious six-part mini-series in which John Lurie goes on fishing expeditions with five American cinematic greats, his partners-in-crime here, Jarmusch and Tom Waits amongst them; one that I'd love to see both get a blu upgrade as well as more episodes, now 25 years later). Also, clearly Jarmusch had a fine rapport with his actors, for this is by far the best and most restrained work I have ever seen from Roberto Benigni.\r\n\r\nOne of Jarmusch's more atypical films, 'Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai', is still my personal favourite, but this is right up there alongside. It would also make an intriguing double-bill with Jeff Nichols' stellar, though more serious in tone, recent film, 'Mud'.", "**It's not a film for those looking for suspense or action, but it's perfect for those who want a solid film with very well-developed characters.**\r\n\r\nDirected and written by Jim Jarmusch, this film was obviously never going to be a suspenseful action drama. The director seems to prefer something more subtle, favoring cinematography, with very good filming angles and framing and the use of good sets. That's precisely what we have in this film, where we follow a man in a bizarre story: he's unemployed, urgently needs some money and accepts a seemingly simple job. However, this work was nothing more than a trap: accused of a crime he never committed, he is arrested and ends up with another wronged man and an Italian, who barely speaks English, but who devises an escape plan where the three decide to cooperate.\r\n\r\nThe strong point of this film is the development of the characters. The possible crimes they committed and the injustices they experienced are never in question, all of this only serves to place the three of them in that penitentiary cell together. That's where the film really becomes better and more interesting, after a slow introduction, somewhat lengthy, but perhaps necessary. Each of the three main characters has the right to their time and space to develop and to show their character, personality and way of acting. With time and forced coexistence, and the creation of a common escape plan, they create a bond of trust that the film makes convincing and quite credible.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the strong points of this film are the black and white cinematography, the credible sets and costumes, a very well written script and excellent editing. It's a film that doesn't take much time, which we watch quickly in less than two hours. It doesn't have a very notable soundtrack, but it doesn't need it either. It is clear that Jarmusch's direction does a very solid job, despite the certain inexperience that the director still had, which inclines him more towards experimentalism than any kind of obvious insecurity. Tom Waits and John Lurie do an excellent job with their characters and actually manage to respond positively to the challenges they face. However, it is the Italian Roberto Benigni who shines most in the squad. He is currently a highly regarded filmmaker and actor, but at this time he was not well known to the general international public. With a gentle lightness and creativity that characterize him in almost all of his work, the actor dominates every scene in which he appears and it is truly pleasant to see him work here, with his dignified wife, Nicoletta Braschi, who has a smaller role close to the end of the movie."], ["Oh Luke you wild beautiful thing!\r\n\r\nLuke (Paul Newman) lands himself in a Deep South prison farm for drunkenly cutting the heads off of parking meters. Once at the farm Luke refuses to be ground down by the system and its grinning warden (a brilliant Strother Martin). As things role by Luke becomes something of a hero to his fellow inmates and this is not lost on the authority in charge of the farm. Things are sure to come to a head as Luke rebels to the point of no return...\r\n\r\nDivision of Corrections. Road Prison 36.\r\n\r\nThe close examination of Cool Hand Luke over the years has rightly thrown up the fact that it's a Christ allegory. Which is just fine given that Stuart Rosenberg's film is one of the finest films that the 60s had to offer. It also boasts, arguably of course, the Paul Newman signature role (yes even better than The Hustler). As the title suggests, Cool Hand Luke, both the film and character, there is a great deal of cool here, in fact for a great deal of the first half of movie it's laced with comic touches as we warm easily to the \"rebel against the system\" machismo and charm that Newman provides as Lukas Jackson. Yet the film then shifts considerably at the mid-point to give us something far more potent and dramatic to alter any preconceptions the audience had of this just being a movie about a macho loner earning our sympathy.\r\n\r\nCalling it your job don't make it right Boss.\r\n\r\nMuch in the film has been firmly ensconced in the memorable moments department, 50 eggs, tar that road quickly, the \"Kick a Buck\" poker game, \"still shaking boss\", a mountain of rice to be eaten, sneezing bloodhounds, the boxing match and one of the greatest and most iconic of tag-lines ever, \"what we got here is a failure to communicate\", all forming part of a truly great whole. However, revisiting the picture often brings the realisation that so much more is on offer than at first thought. Luke is a real war hero (this has been missed by both pro and amateur critics) whose crime is pretty tame for the sentence he finds himself faced with. The Dragline (George Kennedy kicking up a storm of acting quality) and Luke friendship that builds with grace and thunder, sexual frustration of the incarcerated male and a mother and son arc that attacks the soul and lets Newman show many of his acting peers just how grief should be acted out on screen...\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't care if it rains or freezes, Long as I have my plastic Jesus, Riding on the dashboard of my car. Through all trials and tribulations, We will travel every nation, With my plastic Jesus I'll go far\"\r\n\r\nWith Newman, Kennedy and Martin holding court with every scene they are in, it would be easy at first glance to ignore the supporting roles, but Rosenberg ensures that supporting players make telling marks. It's a roll call of sweaty and twitchy character actors that features the likes of Anthony Zerbe, Joe Don Baker, Clifton James, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, Morgan Woodward, Wayne Rogers and J.D. Cannon. Filmed in Technicolor and Panavision, Rosenberg and cinematographer Conrad Hall do an amazing job of making Stockton, California feel like the actual Deep South. Film unfolds to the backdrop of a sun drenched land inhabited by life's unfortunates and the supposed upstanding face of American officialdom...\r\n\r\nIconography and martyrdom unbound, Cool Hand Luke is a slow-burn classic of deep thematic worth. 10/10", "**Celebrate rebellion at a time when everything deserved to be questioned.**\r\n\r\nThe late sixties marked the rise of a culture of rebellion and challenge to the established order. Young people, university students, minorities, suddenly society goes into upheaval and begins to question and make demands. In a very specific way, I think this film fits very well into this movement, giving us the story of a man who made mistakes and paid \u2013 that's for sure \u2013 and who, between hits and misses, wanted to find his own space in the world and live life on his terms.\r\n\r\nLuke Jackson is truly a non-conformist man and the face of a generation of people increasingly dissatisfied with the society in which they live. The film makes clear that he had everything in his hands to have other destiny, a stable and comfortable life, but that his own actions ruined everything. Why? Because that wasn't enough, and he wanted something different. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he wanted, but he knew exactly what he didn't want: to feel subjugated. This expresses what American society, particularly young people, had been feeling: no more meaningless rules, absolute dogmas, ostracism and sacred cows. In that prison where even to urinate or drink water they have to ask permission, Luke questioned all.\r\n\r\nA good story, very well written and with magnificent dialogues, is accompanied by a good work of cinematography, sets and costumes, and an effective direction guaranteed by Stuart Rosenberg. It is in the editing work that I felt the biggest mistakes were made, giving the film an uneven rhythm, as the film was composed of a collage of episodes from Luke's time in that work camp. That is, it lacks the idea and feeling of unity and fluidity, with several situations similar to each other and a certain absence of dramatic tension, more palpable in the final half.\r\n\r\nPaul Newman provides a strong and charismatic lead and was a safe bet to play the rebel hero. Fortunately for us, the film has the support of several other great actors in supporting roles, preventing it from being a one-man effort. George Kennedy, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor thanks to this film, stands out from the crowd thanks to a careful performance, the best of this actor's career. Worthy of mention are also the efforts of J. D. Cannon, Jo Van Fleet, Lou Antonio and Strother Martin."], ["In September 1939, six days after Britain declared war on Nazi Germany, Charlie Chaplin began filming his next feature. Drawing on the public perception of the similarities between himself and Adolf Hitler - not just his toothbrush moustache but also their upbringings - Chaplin sought to directly parody and attack the German f\u00fchrer and fascism.\r\n\r\nIn _The Great Dictator_, Adenoid Hynkel (Chaplin) rules Tomania and sets about his conquest of the world. In doing so, he persecutes Jewish people, including a former veteran of World War I who is now a barber (also Chaplin).\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the film was a hit on release, resonating well with the anti-Nazi sentiment in both American and British public. Chaplin understood that delivering his political message was so important that he forewent his usual desire for a silent film in order to get his message across.\r\n\r\nSound is used to great effect in _The Great Dictator_. By studying many of Hitler's speeches, Chaplin was able to create a ludicrous, yet believable, gibberish parody of the Nazi leader's oratory style. \r\n\r\nOf course, the physical comedy remains, typically reserved for the barber (who may or may not be Chaplin's silent hero, The Tramp). This combination of physical comedy and irreverent one liners together makes the film feel like a very early Carry On.\r\n\r\nWhile _The Great Dictator_ remains arguably Chaplin's best \"talkie\", it often feels like it is the end of Chaplin's era of classical pantomime. People being hit on the head with a saucepan comes across as a cheap laugh and it is often the verbal jokes that are the cleverest. Overall the comedy has not aged well.\r\n\r\nBut _The Great Dictator_ was never designed for longevity. It was perfect propaganda for the Allies, released at a perfect point in the War. For that reason, The Great Dictator can only be judged in the context of its release."], ["Oh, man, what a movie!\r\n\r\nPerfect on every sense. Great cast, with terrific Bogart and Bacall. Complex and interesting plot and smart dialogues. Only \"funny\" thing, if we want to say something, is the \"perception\" of the women roles in the movie. They are strangely all sexy and attracted to and tempting Philip Marlow.", "This continues the incredible run of films Bogie made with now-wife Lauren Bacall. Crackling script ran to perfection by Howard Hawks. Essential, especially for fans of detective thrillers or simply well-made movies.", "\"General Sternwood\" (Charles Waldron) has two daughters and poor old private detective \"Philip Marlowe\" (Humphrey Bogart) might be forgiven for ever getting involved with a case that sees him employed to investigate a case of blackmail against his youngest - \"Carmen\" (Martha Vickers). It looks like she is the target of the venal rare book seller \"Geiger\" but swiftly we realise that that's just the tip of an iceberg that includes not just that blackmail, but another one - with the duplicitous \"Joe\" (Louis Jean Heydt) and then there's the missing \"Regan\" which takes him fairly and squarely into the scheming orbit of the other daughter \"Vivian\" (Lauren Bacall). Soon he's chasing his tail, getting thumped, tied up, shot at - and all whilst he slowly falls for his femme fatale. Who's pulling the strings and why? The story itself isn't the most complex - it's a fairly standard Raymond Chandler adventure. What makes this positively glow are the performances. Bogart and Bacall exude a chemistry that's understatedly provocative. Bacall, especially, uses the less-is-more style with a flash of her eyes or a gesture from her cigarette; Bogart just needs to smile or shrug. It comes alive. The effective use of rain, light, shade and a strong support from Vickers and Bob Steele as crooked henchman \"Canino\" all help this to create an atmosphere of menace tinged with some dark humour and presented via a strong script. Howard Hawks knows how to let his stars get on with it, and he delivers well with this compelling and superior example of Hollywood at it's very best.", "**A film that would be truly memorable if the script wasn't so poorly written.**\r\n\r\nIn general, I really like noir films, it's a style that I like. However, despite the great reputation, I didn't particularly like this film. It's good, and from a style point of view, it gives us everything we like to see in a noir. However, the film fails too much when it comes to the script and the story it intends to tell us. This is not a mistake that I am willing to forgive lightly, especially if we are talking about a production at the highest level and with professionals of the highest caliber, as is the case.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the film is a sight for sore eyes. The black-and-white cinematography is of the utmost elegance, and the lighting was magnificently crafted. The sharpness is excellent, and the filming work gives us some truly well-shot and well-framed scenes. It's very difficult to do better and being more demanding would be unfair, I think. We cannot leave aside the orchestral soundtrack, accompanying each scene with dignity and notably increasing the dramatic charge of some moments. The sets are very well-designed, the costumes are excellent (the highlight, I would say, is Bogart's costume, corresponding to the classic image of the detective in a Fedora hat and trench coat), the cars couldn't be more stylish (I'm suspicious because I'm a huge fan of classic cars from this period) and the props are excellent.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is in the performance of the cast that the film shows all its quality: in a cast headed by Humphrey Bogart, there is not a single actor that we feel is too much or has been underutilized. Everyone had their time to shine and show talent, a sign that the director, Howard Hawks, managed the talents he had at his disposal very well. Bogart, as almost always happens, does not disappoint us: he is comfortable with these types of characters and knows well how to interpret them, giving the character a balanced dose of cynical humor, restrained heroism and well-intentioned brutality. Some of the film's most quotable and memorable lines are his. Another great actress we can see here is Martha Vickers. Her role is brief and much of it was cut in post-production, but the actress is hypnotic and sensual like a Lolita. Lauren Bacall, who was Bogart's lover at the time and would later become his wife, is also a strong and impactful presence, but I think I've seen her much better in other works. What's missing here is an equally strong and charismatic villain.\r\n\r\nWhere the film fumbled was really in the script, which presents us with a confusing and disjointed story involving the two spoiled daughters of a very rich retired general. The film treats the story with indecent carelessness, and I had to make a huge effort to understand what was going on. I confess that perhaps it would have been better not to have done it, because it really is a weak and poorly developed story, unacceptable in a work of such quality. I don't know the original material on which the film was based, I just know that it gave rise to other films and adaptations. Be that as it may, I simply cannot accept it and \u201csuck it up\u201d! This simply cannot happen. But anyway, things are what they are, and it's sad to see a film with so much quality have such an unforgivable flaw."], ["Majestic in scope and story telling.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, is that Ben-Hur deserved every award that was showered upon it. It's a titanic film both in structure and scope. It doesn't need me to go over old ground about how much the film cost to make, the number of extras, the number of sets and etc, it's now folklore that this film could have bankrupted MGM such was the investment, but they needn't have worried since the film went on to make 40 million and still counting.\r\n\r\nEvery cent spent was worth it because it's a magnificent film, the kind that you can get swept away with, the minute the overture starts you feel little tingles as the hairs on your arms stand up on end, you are aware that for over three hours director William Wyler and lead actor Charlton Heston are going to own you.\r\n\r\nThe story centres around Judah Ben-Hur (Heston) who through his staunch loyalty to the Jewish race falls out with his dear Roman friend Messala (Stephen Boyd). He is dispatched to be a slave in the galleys and swears revenge on Messala. After pirates attack the ship he is slaved on, he manages to escape and in the process he saves Roman Admiral Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) and this sets Juda on his destiny to enact revenge on his old friend as Quintus makes him a citizen of Rome.\r\n\r\nIt sounds so simple yet it's a story of the highest order because crucial to the film's core strength is Judah's encounters with Christ, and it's only during the harsh and upsetting final reel that we realise the whole point of the film. There's also strong themes involving family love and loyalty, friendships formed or broken under race and creed banners, and of course religious beliefs and all that comes with that kettle of fish... \r\n\r\nIt's epic, it's simply beautiful, it's actually essential viewing for any serious cinema fan, the film's set pieces are still wondrous even today. You will marvel at the chariot race (a stunning 20 minutes long), you will hoist the flag during the pirate attack, and if you have the emotion in you? You will be hit with sombre silence as Christ is crucified. Come the closing music I personally feel like clapping such is the appreciation I have for this truly wonderful film, if you haven't seen it then make a point of doing so because everything that is great about cinema is right here. 10/10", "What can be said about this film that hasnt already been said?  \r\nI could (justly) use every superlative known and it still does not cover just how amazing this film is.  It is the essence of EPIC (and not just historical epic).  \r\nIt is easy to see why it was not matched in the number of Oscars given for 50 years (and those 'equals' did not include any acting oscars and had more categories to choose from).  \r\n\r\nI first watched this as a kid and struggled to stay awake to see the end late at night.  And despite it not having the spectacle of say the Ten Commandments, it became a favourite which I have watched over and over again.  \r\n\r\nI adore everything in this film - from the gritty stoic-ness of Heston's acting and cockiness of Boyd's, the fleshed out minor characters, the jaw-dropping sets, stirring score from Rozsa, the stunning costumes and of course to the incredible set pieces.  \r\n\r\nThis is film perfection that does not feel like its (nearly) 4 hour run time.", "It will probably be remembered for it's chariot race long after all of the rest of it has faded away, but this is more than just that. It is a story about friendship, religion, power and opportunity - it is also about sheer bloody-mindedness and cruelty. It resonates all the more because these are all human traits that abound in all of us to some extent. The film looks truly amazing and Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3sza is on top form with a score that encapsulates the Imperial grandeur of the Roman State in all of it's Tiberian pomp. The story, though, is a less impressive affair. Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd demonstrate how love can turn to hate splendidly when on screen together, the rest of the time neither performance really delivers much beyond the script. Jack Hawkins tries hard, but again doesn't quite hit the mark as the Consul. Hugh Griffith is a star as the mischievous, avaricious Sheik Ilderim and Sam Jaffe is also a good addition to this cast. It is way too long; after the chariot race it turns a little too much into the \"tale of the Christ\" referred to by author General Lew Wallace at the very start and for me, somehow loses it's way. The battle scenes at sea are great and the sumptuous costumes, cinematography and sound all well deserving of their golden statuettes. A very good, but not quite great, cinema epic."], ["As career defining roles go, this has to one of the more masterful efforts from Ben Kingsley who manages to engage right from the start with his sprightly, intelligent and considered portrayal of this visionary and independently minded man of peace. Arriving in South Africa, his baptism into a sea of bullishness and racism quickly tests his mettle and soon has him on the radar of a General Smuts (Athol Fugard) government that was as yet unused to any sort of challenge from the non-white elements of society. Unafraid to take a beating, or to challenge the cultural norms without own his own caste-driven society, he is swiftly back in India where, flushed with a degree of success, he allies with Pandit Nehru (Roshan Seth) and becomes even more determined to use the sheer size of the dominated Indian population to rebel against the last vestiges of post war Raj. His strategy of non-cooperation sees him incarcerated and separated from those he loved but, again, his patience and determination made even the most formidable of his foes realise that this man was just a bit different - and that he was on a path to a victory that necessitated a dignified, but definite, retreat. The latter part of the story illustrates well that old adage about the difficulties of winning the peace, made more difficult by intolerances of an all together different nature, before a denouement that history dictated for all. Richard Attenborough told a story of his first meeting with Prime Minister Nehru when he was planning this film, and of how that ten minutes of courtesy ended up considerably longer and more beneficial to the look of this beautifully filmed biopic. Using grand scale cinematography that focusses on the vastness and variety of the country, but also using an intimate and really quite tough to watch style of photography as the brutish behaviour towards the colonised was clearly demonstrated. As to the exact nature of the history, I'm not sure that detail mattered so much as the overall assemblage of some of the great from British stage and screen who seemed, by themselves, to offer an heart-felt apology for what had gone on as the sun did start to set on the Empire. There features also a gently supporting effort from Geraldine James's Mirabehn and Candice Bergen also helps the narrative's chronology along as the photo-journalist never far from Gandhi's side. It's long and can be a little sluggish at times, but the sheer participatory nature of this is reminiscent of the epic cinema of the days when crowds were real, cheap, colourful and enthusiastic - and that all adds to the richness of this classy and stylish production. Big screen experiences don't come much more poignant and this is well worth a watch in a cinema if you can."], ["Sam Waterston is New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg on post in Cambodia as the civil war comes to it's violent, cruel conclusion. Working with local journalist Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) they report on the rapidly deteriorating situation. When the American forces evacuate, Pran manages to get his family to safety but he can't leave himself and so Schanberg dedicates himself to the task of extricating his friend from the clutches of the brutal Pol Pot regime in the course of which he discovers just how extensive the \"Year Zero\" campaign that killed hundreds of thousands of the largely peaceful, agrarian population is. Roland Joff\u00e9 has never made a better film; the poignancy with which he elicits loyalty and affection from the two principals, whilst at the same time pushing home the true horrors of the behaviour of the new government makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up- even now, 35 years later. The visions of skull strewn paddy fields coupled with a splendidly evocative score from Mike Oldfield really do hit home. The dialogue very much takes second place to that imagery; our eyes and ears do much of their own work with a sensitive, but really quite minimal guide from Bruce Robinson's screenplay. That's not a criticism; it's precisely nuanced to allow the story to breathe and develop in a truly engrossing manner that made me want to follow up. As an aside, having been to Cambodia in 2019, it is astonishing how this nation has healed after such a ghastly period in it's history, and I wonder how much that reconciliation had to do with the depiction in this film of just how horrific war can be.", "**A remarkable film that deserves to be viewed and that recalls a barbaric moment in the history of a country.**\r\n\r\nWhen there's a war, there's bound to be a film about what happened during that same war. Human conflicts have always fueled the film industry. It's something instinctive, we are attracted to the horror of carnage at the same time that we feel guilty about it, and we get tired of condemning violence and cruelty. I think that only those who have lived through a war have the ability to overcome this paradox, not only because of the memories evoked, sometimes traumatic, but also because of the awareness that there is nothing truly beautiful about this.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in Cambodia (and Rwanda, Bosnia and other countries) was much worse than a war. It was a genocide, a crime against humanity carried out due to the political fanaticism of a small group of \u201cmen\u201d who tried to impose their own vision of the world and kill anyone who disagreed. What this film does is give us a flavor of what happened, bringing us the true (obviously fictionalized) story of a Cambodian journalist who, in 1973, saved the lives of a group of colleagues from the West, but ended up being left behind. behind, imprisoned in a Cambodian prison camp.\r\n\r\nI think I wouldn't be incorrect if I said that, considering the documentaries I've seen on the subject, the film shows a very light and attenuated view of the cruelties that happened there at the time. Roland Joff\u00e9 balanced it well, giving the film a raw realism without making it excessively graphic, and focusing on the emotional charge, on the emotions that everything can awaken in the audience. We don't need to see more than what we see to feel the pain of those people and the fear they went through.\r\n\r\nSam Waterston does an interesting job as an American journalist who desperately tries to find the man to whom he feels he owes his life. Julian Sands and John Malkovich also appear, but they don't have much time or material to stand out, limiting themselves to what they can do. Who is in the spotlight, with all merit, is Haing S. Ngor, a Cambodian actor who gave life to the central character of this story and who knew very well the horror that his country had gone through: he himself had seen the realities that he interpreted as actor, and had been a prisoner of the Khmer Rouge. Therefore, there is a painful load of realism in his interpretation that permeates the screen and reaches us, and to which we cannot and cannot remain indifferent.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is perfect: filmed mostly in Thailand, it makes good use of the settings and creates something we can believe in. The sets and costumes are the most realistic there is, and the cinematography is a bit reminiscent of those old war films in Vietnam. There are good special effects and some anthology-worthy scenes, such as the one that shows us the prison camps and the \u201cbrainwashing\u201d that their captors were subject to force. The soundtrack is not always effective, sometimes it sounds excessively melodramatic, but it is the only drawback to a remarkable production, which deserves to be seen, again and again."], ["**An exceptionally well-made film about an ordinary boy experiencing things common to almost all boys his age.**\r\n\r\nI don't have much experience with Swedish cinema, but what I saw already showed me that it is quality cinema, so it was with some curiosity that I sat down for another film. It centers on a boy, Ingemar, who lives with his brother and mother, who is very sick and unable to control their restlessness. When she dies, the two brothers are separated and Ingemar goes to live with his uncles, who have no children but seem genuinely interested in providing him with a good education. So, it's just another film about growing up, maturing, adolescence, discovering the body and feelings.\r\n\r\nWe've seen a lot of similar things, there's no denying it. Therefore, the film may not be the most interesting for those who do not like this more intimate genre of cinema. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom, the film bets on minimalism, naturalness and realism: there is nothing flashy or far-fetched, the sets, costumes, environments and situations taking place are credible, recognizable. The cinematography is very good, it makes clever use of light and framing and the soundtrack is atmospheric, if not exactly memorable. The actors, on the other hand, are quite convincing, and the fact that I don't know them (I'm not an expert on Swedish cinema, I repeat) helps to make their effort even more credible.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this film, therefore, turns out to be its excess of normality and an excessive normalization of things. I don't know how many people are open to seeing a film about the life of an ordinary boy doing ordinary things and experiencing things that all of us, in one way or another, experienced, without anything extraordinary to justify it. It's a minor problem, but it turns out to be the film's biggest problem, and perhaps the reason why it didn't win more audiences (besides the language barrier, because in many places subtitled cinema is not the first choice of viewers)."], ["From the upper echelon of boys own adventures comes - The Man Who Would Be King!\r\n\r\nTwo ex-servicemen are lolling around colonial India, it's just the start of a journey that will see them in Kafiristan. Here the mountain dwellers believe the rouge white fellows to be Gods, and thus things are about to get very interesting indeed.\r\n\r\nWritten by master writer Rudyard Kipling, directed by behemoth John Huston and starring British legends Sean Connery & Michael Caine, there really isn't any way this film could have failed - sure enough the picture exudes a classy structure that is coupled with deftly smart writing. The Man Who Would Be King was a project that John Huston had coveted for many a year (decade), as far back as the 40s he was looking to adapt the Kipling short with Humphrey Bogart & Clark Gable in the leads. Some time after it was mooted that he fancied Peter O'Toole & Richard Burton to play Messrs Dravot & Carnehan. Fast forward to 1975 and the eventual pairing of Caine & Connery now looks like a masterstroke of casting, and it really is impossible to imagine anyone else in the roles of the amoral scavenger duo of the piece. in short, the wait for the film was indeed worth it.\r\n\r\nThat the film is known as an adventure genre staple is a given, but it should be noted that in amongst the delightful fusion of fantasy and swashbuckling values, there lies wonderful characterisation, cheeky sly glances at the power crazy, imperialism, greed, and it pulses a political beat. A highly entertaining picture that stands up really well ever more today in this new millennium age. I mean it's got Caine & Connery playing rapscallions for Gods sake! Enough said there me thinks! 8/10", "**A magnificent adventure film that adapts to the cinema a short story by Rudyard Kipling about greed, and the price that can be paid for it.**\r\n\r\nBorn in India, Rudyard Kipling is one of the most distinguished British writers of the late 19th century, and perhaps one of the most prolific. Seeing a list of his written work is an exercise in patience, and if we think that he wrote it all in sunlight or gas and using a dip pen, without computers or electric light to see better, it is truly remarkable.\r\n\r\nComing from an aristocratic family closely linked to colonial life, he had a conservative upbringing and his youth is indelibly linked to India, which he always portrayed as something idyllic. Still in India, he had a Portuguese Catholic nanny, with whom he prayed. Already in adult life, he traveled and got to know well the United States and the East. But Kipling was a man of his time, and that time was the height of British rule in India, the time of the British Empire. And he, according to the education and values he received, always believed in the civilizing value of the colonial mission of the European peoples \u2013 and particularly of the United Kingdom, his homeland, which he always defended without caring about the consequences of the use of force. A profound jingoist, he paid for it years later: in World War I, he lost a son in combat and was particularly active in collaborating with the Red Cross and comforting the wounded. And curiously, he was perhaps one of the first to see the danger that came with the rise of Hitler and Mussolini.\r\n\r\nThis film, inspired by one of the author's most controversial stories, tells us about the ambition and greed of two British soldiers who decide to take advantage of the naivety of an isolated population in a desolate area of today's Pakistan. They decide to go there, knowing that there were many tribal wars, and become kings of those people. With free access to whatever riches they could get their hands on, they hoped to return to England rich. This short story is a critique against the ambition of some Englishmen and the unfair way in which the locals were robbed of their values. I am sure that Kipling knew and condemned such excesses. And the movie is faithful to his tale.\r\n\r\nJohn Huston did an excellent job on this film, which stands out among his filmography as one of the director's best works. In addition to being able to give us the epic, beautiful and fearsome aroma of the region where everything takes place, he manages to extract the best from a very strong cast, led by three titanic actors: Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer and Sean Connery. If we have high regard for each one's talent and journey, it is truly unmissable to see them together. Even though they are two greedy adventurers, Caine and Connery's work manages to make us like their characters, particularly Connery, whose character makes an extraordinary dramatic arc: he really starts to care about those people.\r\n\r\nThe film has excellent cinematography, with bold colors and plenty of lighting, but what is truly remarkable is the choice of filming locations, which center around Morocco. The rugged beauty of the mountains is magnetic, and the omnipresent sense of danger, even in the most peaceful of situations, locks us into the canvas. Maurice Jarre wrote the soundtrack, which may well be among the composer's best."], ["**Perhaps one of the most striking films in the work of Geoffrey Rush, and one of the toughest and most sincere portrayals of brilliance that cinema has seen to date.**\r\n\r\nEven though I'm a pretty serious music lover, and I've always loved classical music, I didn't know David Helfgott until I saw this film. The musical universe is full of prodigies who reveal talent since childhood. Mozart is perhaps the most famous example of this. However, it is one of those subjects that I feel we tend to overestimate, because you can also find prodigious children in other areas of knowledge, including the Human Sciences. It is, however, curious that we have so few examples of musical geniuses with solid and successful careers. Most pianists and musical performers, no matter how talented they are, depend more on their self-discipline and intensive training than on their basic talent.\r\n\r\nHelfgott, according to this film, had a difficult childhood, at the hands of an overbearing father, who basically pushed him towards a music career, realizing his talent. The problem is that the situation demanded a lot from the young genius, causing him to develop schizophrenia and several other mental problems. With serious speech problems (he stutters and talks compulsively), he is also incapable of maintaining a conventional relationship with the people around him. Of course, in the long run, we'll see how he gets around the difficulties and achieves consecration.\r\n\r\nHelfgott is played by several actors, but it is Geoffrey Rush who shines in the role. The actor was able, in this film, to cross the doors of international cinema thanks to one of the most complete and immersive portrayals of genius in cinema. Appearing on stage when the film is already halfway through, he dominates the entire work, imposing himself, demanding our attention, deserving applause. Even if the film no longer had any reason to merit \u2013 it does! \u2013 seeing the performance of this British actor would always be more than enough reason to justify a trip to the cinema. However, he is not alone: the film also gives us an excellent interpretation of Armin Mueller-Stahl in the role of the father, demanding and domineering. Noah Taylor, who gives life to the character of Helfgott in his youth, also leaves us with a job well done and of value.\r\n\r\nThe script and direction also deserve a note of praise. Scott Hicks, who performs both tasks, has managed to create a film that is deeply dramatic, intense, capable of moving and making us think, without making the mistake of making it overly melodramatic or presenting things that are too dark and pessimistic. The film is deeply emotional, it even has several intense, almost painful scenes, but it is never a heavy film. In addition, the film makes a very clever use of cinematography and the soundtrack to lighten or thicken the entire environment in which the action takes place. In addition to the pieces by Rachmaninoff \u2013 a piano genius, but who finds equivalents in composers such as Chopin, Scriabin or Liszt, author of the naive but terribly demanding \u201cLa Campanella\u201d, for me the most difficult solo piano \u2013 the film has a vast repertoire of classical pieces skillfully inserted into the soundtrack. It's worth seeing how they are used in the film."], [], [], [], ["If you like the stars in this movie give it a watch.

When Rasputin is cast aside by the Russian Imperial family, he brings down a curse on their heads that results in revolution, murder and mayhem. Shortly afterwards, a young girl is walking past a boarded-up palace one chilly evening and she breaks in. That's when she encounters the sheltering young \"Dimitri\" and his cohort \"Vladimir\". The former man takes a bit of a shine to the young girl, and after a few glances at some of the portraiture adorning the walls, concludes that she could be the eponymous Grand Duchess and their ticket to riches in Paris. She's not as willing at the con artistry as they are, but is hungry and cold and desperate so accompanies them to France where an intense course of training, a convenient friendship with \"Sophie\" and some perseverance sees her in the presence of her would-be grandmother, the Dowager Empress. Will the old and somewhat sceptical lady be convinced...?Meantime, the spectre of their erstwhile spiritual advisor is aware that she is perhaps on the cusp of restoring the Romanov fortunes, and so conjures up all of his dastardly might to ensure that the demise of the family is complete. Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens provide a modestly powerful score but the lavish look of the film, some colourful visual effects (mindful of \"Sleeping Beauty\" from 1959) and a solid script deliver an entertaining story of just how powerful love can be - even when faced with the lure of an enormous diamond tiara."], [], ["**Money Train loses interest while trying to figure out what it wants to be.**\r\n\r\nMoney Train is a movie with an identity crisis.

Doesn\u2019t work.

You should understand how hard to make movies based on such a legendary universe (expectation is too high!), with a lot of characters that need screen time, and with limited budget, PLUS in a pandemic situation, - the director made a great job.\r\n\r\nThis is the best adaptation of such a legendary title.", "Mortal Kombat Gives Fans Of The Franchise The Brutal Live-Action Version They Deserve\r\nFans of the Mortal Kombat series have known that the path to bringing the violent and controversial game to live-action formats has been a mixed bag. While the first film in 1995 was a decent hit; the follow-up in 1997 disappointed fans who had grown weary of the PG-13 take on the series.\r\n\r\nSubsequent efforts such as the 2011 television series also left fans wanting more; especially since the game series had become even more graphic and violent.\r\n\r\nAn animated film released in 2020 gave fans a taste of what they wanted as it featured graphical violence which many fans believed was essential to properly catch the spirit and action of the series.\r\n\r\nThe latest offering in the series \u201cMortal Kombat\u201d; reboots the cinematic universe and gives fans the intense, brutal, and graphic violence that they have demanded. The film keeps the basic premise that the Outworld realm has won nine tournaments in a row, and based on the ancient laws; one more victory would allow them to take control of the Earth.\r\n\r\nRaiden the Thunder God (Tadanobu Asano); who has been tasked with protecting Earth looks to assemble and train a band of champions to save Earth. Naturally, this is not going to be easy as Shang Tsung (Chin Han); is not willing to follow the rules of the tournament and dispatches his top fighter (Sub Zero (Joe Taslim) to dispatch the champions of Earth before the tournament in a clear violation of the rules in order to ensure total victory.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is solid and very graphic action which contains gore and brutality on a level that almost kept the film from earning an R-rating. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there were some great recreations of classic moves by characters from the game series which were really well utilized and did not seem like gratuitous pandering.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot is fairly simplistic and does not deviate greatly from the source material; it does give a larger backstory to the universe. It was really enjoyable to see many nods to the franchise throughout both subtle and overt and while some characters were glaringly absent which was a surprise; the characters that were included were really solid to see and the door was wide open for their inclusion at a later date.\r\n\r\nWhile the cast does not contain any star power in terms of what Western audiences might expect from a major studio release; the ensemble works well and do a great job in bringing their characters to life.\r\n\r\nThe film leaves sequels wide open and teases a character that in my opinion was a glaring omission from the film. That being said; \u201cMortal Kombat\u201d gives fans a solid adaptation that does not shy away from gore and violence and gives fans the cinematic experience that they have wanted.\r\n\r\n3.5 stars out of 5", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nEven though I consider myself somewhat of a gamer, I was never the biggest fan of the Mortal Kombat games, probably because I never really knew how to play them. Besides occasional visits to my neighbor's house to play several games on his PlayStation 1 (or 2?), I've only played this game on the nostalgic arcade machines that gave me incredible joy when I was younger. In all honesty, I don't exactly remember if I watched the previous film adaptations of the popular franchise, but I do know that both didn't receive the best feedback from critics and audiences, especially the 1997's flick. Therefore, I went to the theater - first time in over four months - with no real expectations. I just hoped the action would compensate for the predictably flawed screenplay.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm surprised at how much I actually had fun with this movie. Considering this is Simon McQuoid's feature directorial debut, as well as Greg Russo's first screenplay credit, my hopes rested on Dave Callaham's previous works (Wonder Woman 1984, Zombieland: Double Tap) and on the gory, violent action sequences. The latter component is the best element in the entire film, which will definitely leave the viewers in search of action-heavy entertainment satisfied. The opening sequence shows the merciless brutality of each fight through phenomenal stunt work (Hiroyuki Sanada is impressively talented), long takes with exceptional choreography, and a shocking amount of blood - something quite characteristic of the game franchise.\r\n\r\nThe only negative aspect about this opening is the fact that no other action scene surpasses it, which doesn't mean that the rest of the battles fail to live up to the expectations of the most avid fans. Despite a few shaky, roughly edited scenes, the vast majority of the fights are easy to follow and feature jaw-dropping moments, such as the \"Fatality!\" finishing moves. McQuoid and his team of writers try to make the movie understandable and exciting to everyone, but if there's a chance of placing a reference, an Easter Egg, or something alike, they proudly and unrestrainedly present it to the audience, which will trigger the most hardcore fans to let go of a resounding, adrenaline-fueled \"YEAH!\".\r\n\r\nI admit that I didn't expect the film to deliver those epic announcements from the game. From \"Flawless Victory!\" to \"Fatality!\", without forgetting the classic \"Fight!\", I did smile during these moments, where the actors actually change the tone of their voice to mimic the famous one-liners. Is it extraordinarily cheesy and over-the-top? Of course. Would any fan want it any other way? It might be a tad too much for some viewers, but I have to compliment McQuoid for fully committing to this adaptation. There's no ounce of shame, regret, or restraint. It's a movie made with a passionate public in mind, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to every single fan of the games.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe people will end up liking or disliking this film based on how much the action compensates for the lack of a compelling story, which is something even the most enthusiastic fans are probably anticipating as well. From a couple of nonsensical narrative decisions to hollow, uninteresting characters, the screenplay is solely focused on explaining everything surrounding Mortal Kombat - Earthworld, Outworld, champions, stakes, rules of the tournament - through lazy yet admittedly efficient exposition scenes. The characters could have been better developed, and the actors are far from being completely convincing. However, no one will enter the theater or click \"play\" on HBO Max expecting to witness an Oscar-worthy story...\r\n\r\nMortal Kombat is a surprisingly decent adaptation of the popular franchise, which will leave the most hardcore fans quite satisfied. For viewers with no experience or knowledge about the games, it could be a tough watch. However, if all the audience seeks is action-heavy entertainment, then Simon McQuoid's directorial debut fulfills the more reasonable expectations. Packed with references that even the least avid gamers will recognize, the fighting scenes are mostly well-filmed and quite energetic, focusing more on the gruesome, bloody, jaw-dropping Fatalities. Despite the opening sequence being the peak of great action, there are a couple of moments that could be compared to some parts of that epic start. Story-wise, Greg Russo and Dave Callaham's screenplay is as flawed as expected, possessing ridiculous developments and an abundance of dull exposition scenes, but it's the underwhelming use of a few interesting characters that negatively impacts the movie the most. In the end, I definitely recommend it to fans of the franchise, who will surely appreciate this film a lot more than myself.\r\n\r\nRating: B-", "I liked this more than I should have.  \r\n\r\nI have tried the games, but am not into the fighting genre of games (although the Injustice series grabbed me for its story).  The previous movies were fun and didnt take themselves seriously - which was good, but they got too hammy and over the top.  The last cartoon took itself way to seriously and was disappointing and forgettable to say the least.  \r\n\r\nThis movie, however seemed to grab everything good from the previous attempts, added actors who know some martial arts, used some of the key terms and moves from the games and had a stand out performance from Josh Lawson as Kano adding the 'very dry type of  Australian' humour.

I felt disconnected from Raiden and Shang Tsung because they were so emotionless and hollow. I did like who they got to play Kabal because I felt like that character was really well-written. I usually don't like Sonya Blade but this movie made me like her. I don't like Liu Kang I never will so it didn't much matter who they cast in that role because that character to me is too generic. I did not care one way or another for Kung Lao or Kano. The guy playing Jax has been the best Jax so far. I hate how they made Milenna look in this one and it just didn't suit the purpose of what her character really is. Goro felt copied and pasted from the original film.\r\n\r\nAll in all this could have been much better but I doubt we get to see anything past this due to how generic and unfeeling this film actually felt.

Only last year the animated Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge covered the exact same ground, and did it a lot better. The intertitle that follows the prologue confirms that we are not about to see anything new (Earthrealm blahblahblah Tournament blahblahblah Outworld blahblahblah).\r\n\r\nMK21 contains exactly (sub)zero surprises. The first time we see Jax, we know he is going to lose his original arms and have them replaced with cybernetic prosthetics (the only surprising thing about this is that the character's first replacement arms are quite underwhelming. Jax eventually gets something more in line with what we\u2019re used to; the question is, why does the movie do in three steps what it should do in two?). Similarly, Kano's true, treacherous nature is no secret.\r\n\r\nWe already know all this. We know it like the backs of our hands. If we don't know it from playing the game, we know it from watching the 1995 movie \u2013 speaking of which, MK95 is 10 minutes shorter (it wasted little time with pre-Tournament antics, and it didn\u2019t even bother with a Training Montage; in contrast, MK21 includes what is best described as a tutorial, not the way you want to go about evoking a video game feel), which is to say 10 minutes better. It also had better effects; its Goro was clumsy and awkward \u2013 something like the Cryptkeeper on stereoids \u2013 but when Johnny Cage punched him in the balls, I felt it. Conversely, when Cole (Lewis Tan), the aforementioned brand-new character, fights Goro in MK21, it\u2019s like he\u2019s shadowboxing, and his shadow happens to be a four-armed man-mountain of pixels.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, what\u2019s the point of watching a movie where we can anticipate every important event, and anything we don\u2019t see coming a mile away turns out to be unnecessary?

A shame, for although not as epic or as rousing as Gibson's Oscar grabber, Caton-Jones' film is a different and more reflective type of historical piece. Thematically the film is a play on virtues, in fact it's a trumpet playing fanfare for such. Honesty, honour, loyalty, fidelity and love nestle in nicely with the wonderful landscapes, born out by Sharp's intelligent script. But that's not to say that the director hasn't got the requisite thrust of stirring adventure within, he has, and Rob Roy rewards in that department as well. The films crowning glory is a climatic sword fight, no tricks or hard to believe heroics, just an expertly shot long sequence that's choreographed sublimely by William Hobbs and Robert G. Goodwin.

The film also possesses a very realistic vibe -- no anachronisms or campy humor here; the pic really helps one realize what life was like in rural Scotland 300 years ago.\r\n\r\nWhat works best, to my mind, is Tim Roth's exceptional performance as Rob Roy's foppish-but-deadly nemesis. This is a villain you love to loathe. The Roth character is so foppish that he appears somewhat effeminate; but this is merely disguise as he's actually a ruthless master swordsman. Surely this is one of film's top villains ever (It doesn't sound right to say \"good villain,\" does it?).\r\n\r\nOn the downside, the story doesn't have a lot of drive from beginning to end unlike, say, \"Last of the Mohicans.\" Your attention may wander at points. Of course this may not be an entirely bad thing in light of the schizophrenic editing of many films post-\"Armageddon\" (1998). In other words, the leisurely pace can be refreshing.\r\n\r\nThere are aspects not appropriate for children: Sexual brutality (a rape scene) and vulgarity (a man shoves his fingers up a woman's nightgown); as well as blatant love-making. There are also overt scenes of, believe it or not, urination; many may regard this as needless, but (for me) it helped drive home the point of what everyday life was like back then, e.g. Where do you pee if you're living in a shack out in the hills? Or, in the middle of the night, if there's no upstairs bathroom?\r\n\r\nThe story's lack of drive prevents \"Rob Roy\" from attaining true greatness in my mind, but the positive aspects noted above certainly achieve greatness and there are several memorable scenes.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot entirely in Scotland.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+", "As a Scot, I tend to look upon the Hollywood treatment of our national history with considerable disdain at the best of times - this is not a film that encourages me to change that philosophy. The general heather and whisky sentiment; the unsophisticated but honourable Scots versus the evil, occupying English is all way to simplistic to be anything more than a romantic adventure drama along the lines of the \"Master of Ballantrae\". Sure, it's grittier than that - the language more course/authentic (take your pick) but both John Hurt as the turncoat Marquis of Montrose and Tim Roth (who perhaps thinks this is a \"Three Musketeers\" romp?) camp it up to the point where you wouldn't have put much money on them escaping from a Parisian brothel unscathed; much less raping, pillaging and ruthlessly scheming to supplant Scottish traditions in favour of their new Hanoverian masters. Eric Stolz and Brian Cox's casting is just bizarre! Andrew Keir, wooden as ever, makes some effort as the Duke of Argyll - another supporter of King George. It has the benefits of some stunning scenery and a cracking score from Carter Burwell, but otherwise it is a mediocre costume drama with a cursory nod to a great Scottish hero."], ["With this having been the first DH film I ever watched (and the only one so far I have seen upon its original theatrical release), I hold a quiet sense of satisfaction that over time it seems to have become generally people's favourite of the series, next to the original. It is much more original than its predecessor, and has much higher-caliber supporting players in Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson--not to mention the best director the franchise has ever had.\r\n\r\nThis was great to see once again, and I STILL have nightmares with that wicked Katya (played by composer Sam Phillips) slicing my head off...", "***Big, dumb, fun action flick with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in New York City***  \r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1995 and directed by John McTiernan, \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" is the third of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. In this one, suspended New York City cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) rejoins the force to tangle with a mad-but-genius German bomber named \u201cSimon\u201d (Jeremy Irons) while teaming up with a good Samaritan from Harlem (Samuel L. Jackson).  \r\n\r\nThis franchise fills the bill if you're in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean \"dumb\" in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond \"genuinely good people may be flawed, cocky and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil.\"\r\n\r\nThe Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's \"The Gauntlet\" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's \"The Mummy Returns.\" \r\n\r\n\"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" evades that ditch because it offers entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing scenes, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story.\r\n\r\nWhile all five Die Hard movies are of the same action expertise, I prefer the sequels because the original film took place almost entirely in and around a skyscraper. I favor the wider location scope of the others, including this one, which was the best up to this point. \r\n\r\nIt starts out a little shaky because Simon\u2019s shenanigans are so contrived they\u2019re unbelievable, but if you can persevere the story builds momentum and there are surprises. Even John and Zeus\u2019 conflict-habituated relationship has a story arc with Zeus being bluntly confronted with his reverse racism. The sometimes contrary camaraderie of John and Zeus is great.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 8 minutes and was shot in New York City; Berkeley County, South Carolina; and Jessup, Maryland (ending). ADDITIONAL CAST: Graham Greene and Colleen Camp are on hand as cops while sharp Sam Phillips appears as an icy Euro-villainess.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/B+", "Bruce Willis returns as \"McClane\", this time being used as a plaything by a telephone terrorist named simply \"Simon\". Unsure as to why this man has alighted on him, he is now sent on a series of missions around the city - fail and a devastating bomb could go off. Along the way, he manages to recruit the assistance of Samuel L. Jackson (\"Zeus\") and together they they must stop more carnage - and thwart the perpetrator's ultimate intentions. It is a little repetitive at times, but there is plenty of on-screen chemistry between Jackson and Willis; their challenges are a little more cerebral and amusing and the plot builds well until quite an exciting, if just a little too far-fetched, denouement with a baddie whose voice we ought instantly to have recognised on the phone. This is just a simple, straightforward action adventure with no romance of familial nonsense to clutter it up and I quite enjoyed it."], [], ["Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis was a hit movie at the time, and other than the Xenos design, I'd say it is still a pretty good movie.  The \"anti-Jaws\" approach of showing the monster off is really cool as the premise is largely how detailed and dangerous the xenos is, but the approach removes a lot of the suspense in the hunting and subterfuge, almost humanizing her as \"hunted by the evil government entity\".\r\n\r\nWhile it would be a much different, and arguably better, movie to do something more like \"The Thing\", that she only has one human mask sorts of outs her, making it more like a spy movie, and I think they did really well with that in mind.\r\n\r\nIt just lacks the level of nuance and hidden information that spy and thriller movies tend to have.\r\n\r\nIt's much closer to \"Aliens\" than \"Alien\".", "_**Wiping out the \"galactic weed**_\"\r\n\r\nReleased in 1995, \"Species\" chronicles events after SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) receives a transmission from outer space detailing alien DNA structure, along with instructions on how to splice it with human DNA. This gives birth to Sil, a girl (Michele Williams) who escapes and rapidly grows into a statuesque blonde (Natasha Henstridge). Government agent Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) assembles a team to locate and destroy Sil before she finds a mate and breeds. The team includes a tough mercenary (Michael Madsen), an anthropologist (Alfred Molina), a molecular biologist (Marg Helgenberger) and an empath (Forest Whitaker).\r\n\r\nI developed a bad attitude toward \"Species\" for years due to Roger Ebert's scathing review, but changed my mind upon giving it an openminded viewing. This is a top-of-the-line sci-fi/adventure/horror flick. People look down on it because of the nudity and mild sex scenes, which prompts them to disdain it as exploitive and trashy. While Natasha Henstridge is a good-lookin' woman, she doesn't do anything for me (she's not my type) so I was able to totally overlook this element and focus on the film's other attributes.\r\n\r\nFor one, the score by Christopher Young is excellent. Secondly, the A-list cast is a highlight and their characters are increasingly fleshed-out in the story. Lastly, while people understandably write-off the movie as a Grade B plot with Grade A production, there's more here than meets the eye. For instance, Sil is the innocent pawn of the extraterrestrials who sent the DNA. Another example is the excellent character of Dan (Whitaker) whom whiners complain about as \"always pointing out the obvious\" when the movie shows over and over that he DOES know things the others don't and they ignore him to their own peril. Dan is necessary so that the team knows what direction the creature takes on repeated occasions; without Dan we'd see them pursue one boring dead-end after another.\r\n\r\nWhile snobby film critics love to hate \"Species\" it's a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi adventure with an interesting moral and a great cast of characters. If you like films like \"Alien,\" \"Aliens,\" \"Terminator,\" \"Terminator 2\" and \"Predator\" you'll probably appreciate it. It may not be as good as \"Aliens,\" \"Terminator\" and \"Terminator 2,\" but it's on par with \"Alien\" (and marginally better IMHO) and superior to \"Predator.\" Then again, it depends on what you want in a sci-fi blockbuster. As far as I'm concerned, \"Species\" delivers the goods.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 108 minutes and was shot in the areas of Los Angeles and Brigham City, Utah.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A- \r\n\r\n***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie) \r\n\r\nThe theory is postulated by the mercenary and biologist that the alien DNA was sent as a biological weapon, a \"weed killer\" from outer space to wipe out the galactic weed of earth or, more accurately, the human race that inhabits it. It's a fascinating concept and the film compellingly realizes it.", "Clearly, these scientists had not heeded Jeff Goldblum in \"Jurassic Park\" (1993) when he warned about stopping to think that just because we can do something, it doesn't mean that we should. If they had, then perhaps we could have avoided the mayhem and brutality caused when they create \"Sil\" (Natasha Henstridge). She is the product of alien and human DNA and can morph between a beautiful woman and a savage killer in the blink of an eye. Of course she escapes from the high security facility that couldn't keep a cow out, and is soon on the search for a man. Not any particular man, just one who can help her make a baby - and believe me, that's not a good plan! The scientists - led by \"Lennox\" (a rather charmless Michael Madson) and \"Baker\" (Marg Helgenberger) are on her trail but can they stop her before she finds a willing partner? To be fair, the visual effects - very \"Terminator\" (1984) style - are actually quite effective but the acting, especially from the always hammy Ben Kingsley, and the scripting are very bottom drawer. There's some imagination with the look of the film, but the delivery is pedestrian across the board before an ending that has an inevitability to it that I found a bit predictable. Not terrible, but a real missed opportunity that had it been cast better and just spent a little more time on the a more substantial story, could have created a better sense of menace and even a little (dark) humour."], [], ["You're a fool to believe in something you've never seen.\r\n\r\nWaterworld is directed by Kevin Reynolds and jointly written by David Twohy, Peter Rader and Joss Whedon.

It was truly the same as burning money. After being impressed by the poor quality of the film, I went to read and research about it, and discovered the eventual cause of this disaster: from the beginning, it was a project doomed to failure. Badly planned, it was filmed in a place where the weather conditions would cause problems. The ambition to do more and better is healthy, but in this case it caused an escalation of costs. To make things more difficult, the production was guided by Kevin's disagreement against Kevin, since the director, Kevin Reynolds, was contradicted several times by the main actor, Kevin Costner. The most blatant disagreement may have happened during post-production, with the actor and the studio demanding a straight cut of the film, which was lame and poorly edited. It had everything to go wrong...\r\n\r\nI know, now, that there are extended versions of the film, but I haven't found a \"director's cut\" that would be able to reverse the changes and give us the version that Reynold initially envisioned. What I saw is the \u201ccanonical version\u201d of about two hours, and I hated it. The script is based on a very apocalyptic and poorly explained future, where the entire world is flooded, and a myth has been created where, somewhere, there would be land, but which no one has actually been able to confirm. The few surviving people live on atolls and artificial islands, and on boats. The film never shows us a storm, a hurricane or anything that threatens the lives of those survivors, nor does it explain how they survived, or why no one properly explores the world to discover signs of earth. There are a lot of loose ends and absurdities, and the film will only work if we avoid thinking about it too much.\r\n\r\nThe cast rests solidly on Kevin Costner's back, and even those who aren't particularly fans of the actor will have to agree that he makes a good acting exercise, and is charismatic enough to ensure the role that is expected of him, especially if we're considering how indigestible and unsympathetic his character can be. Dennis Hopper is a likable villain, more cartoonish than truly menacing. Jeanne Tripplehorn is decent and satisfying.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film stands out for its commitment to excellent production values, with the effort and financial expenditure applied being clear: the choice of filming locations is very good, despite having brought many practical and logistical difficulties to the production; the cinematography takes every opportunity to make the film beautiful and elegant. The sets and costumes, made extremely realistically, are excellent, and you can see that they were expensive and detailed. The action scenes were well-thought-out and executed, and could have been better had the film not been structured for such a low rating. Good effects and a soundtrack that satisfies without enchanting make up the overall picture of a rather forgettable film."], [], ["The Council Estate Western.\r\n\r\nWild Bill is directed by Dexter Fletcher who also co-writes the screenplay with Danny King.

Heading home he finds his two sons Dean (Poulter) and Jimmy (Williams) fending for themselves after their mother abandoned them. Bill hadn't planned on hanging around, but if he doesn't then the boys will be taken into care. More pressing is that the local drug runners have got young Jimmy working for them, Bill might just have to take his parental responsibilities to another level and justify his Wild reputation.\r\n\r\nSplendid piece of British grit and wit, Wild Bill follows in the traditions of films directed by British actors, who for their debut directing assignment impressed with the ability to grab the attention and no loosen the grip. Fletcher has done a bang up job here, managing to turn what could have been a standard dysfunctional family melodrama into something more meaningful, engaging and suspenseful.\r\n\r\nStory is set to the backdrop of working class London, where the building of the Olympic stadium serves as a beacon of hope in the distance, while our principal characters struggle through a world of grimy flats, empty pubs, dirty caf\u00e9s and drug infested council estates.\r\n\r\nThe narrative operates on two fronts, Bill (Miles superb) is trying to keep on the straight and narrow, as he candidly observes, if his dog craps on the pavement he will get 18 months back in prison! But as he tries to build a relationship with his two sons, especially the older and more colder Dean, circumstances are drawing him back into the violent world he desperately wants to leave behind. It's this angle that gives the film its suspense, as viewers we are wondering if Bill can achieve his goals, will he get a break, will the family become one unit?\r\n\r\nElsewhere the film operates as a coming of age story, where Dean has had to grow up real fast to look after his younger brother, even taking on employment at the age of 15 to provide for Jimmy and himself. Then there is matters of the heart, as he is strongly attracted to local girl Steph (Spencer), this aspect is very well handled by Fletcher, who gets the excellent Poulter to deftly portray those early nerves when Cupid starts to draw back its bow, the tentative fumblings of young love easily identifiable to us all.\r\n\r\nPic is full of familiar British faces, most of them just stopping by in cameos to lend friendly support to Fletcher's project. They all offer a reassuring presence to proceedings, adding further weight to what is damn fine debut picture.

In addition to them, we also have the excellent performances by Sarah Peirse, Clive Morrison and Diana Kent, in the role of three of the paternal figures.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film doesn't have any major problems. The pace is ideal, there are no dead moments or situations that seem to be too much or to have been stilted, and the editing is very good and well executed. The cinematography is excellent, with great color and light, particularly in the fantasy scenes, where we enter the fantastic world that these young women created for themselves.

Told in flashback to a very sceptical reporter \"Daniel\" (Christian Slater), Pitt tells of his near 200 year life that started with his meeting with Cruise and his conversion to his immortal existence based on blood. It's a hugely lavish affair, with loads of lust, trickery, duplicity and gore - tinged with genuine regret, loneliness and sadness - and, of course, loads of cruel violence. Whilst it does nod to the whole \"Hammer\" style of horror thrillers - there is plenty of ketchup - the writing and characterisations have much more depth to them. Neither of the principal characters are likeable, but you do build some sort of reverse empathy with - at least Pitt - as the film progresses. The attention to detail on the sets and costumes as we march through time never lessens and contributes magnificently to a stylish, sumptuous glamour-fest. Much as they were/are doubtless box-office A listers, however, Pitt was just too young looking to be convincing, Cruise just can't really act at the best of times, much less with extra dental props and Kirsten Dunst just annoyed me in the best traditions of Shirley Temple.

There are several quality scenes, like the creature's time spent with the peasant family where his unseen help is taken for a \"good spirit of the woods.\"\r\n\r\nThe first time I viewed the movie I was a little turned off by its manic style. People are introduced, scenes flash by, times shift and the soundtrack blares, which struck me as overdone.

I\u2019ve since read Shelley\u2019s book and watched the even more faithful version, Hallmark\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein\u201d (2004) with Luke Goss playing the creature, which runs almost 3 hours.\r\n\r\nSeeing this version again I appreciated it more and was able to see how Branagh provides a nice balance between the hyper moments and more subdued sequences. If it sometimes seems too manic it\u2019s because Branagh tried to cram the bulk of the novel into 2 hours. On the positive side, this makes it play better for those who prefer constant thrills, melodrama, etc. The 2004 version has almost another hour to play with and is more subdued and brooding. This one\u2019s more of a \u201cblockbuster.\u201d\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the 2004 rendition, the creature is more faithful to the book (with long black hair and white teeth), but he\u2019s also too handsome in a dark gothic way, resembling Type O Negative\u2019s Peter Steele. The creature in this version removes the hair and opts for a more gruesome depiction, which fits Victor\u2019s description of the creature as \u201chideous.\u201d In any case, De Niro does a fine job in the role. \r\n\r\nMy favorite part is when the monster finds sanctuary with the rural family, unbeknownst to them. It helps the viewer get to know the creature and have compassion on his plight, but soon all sympathy is pretty much lost. On the other hand, he IS a 'monster\u2019; and he has an interesting discussion with Victor in his remote glacial dwelling in the high country, which helps explain his actions. The locket-framing sequence is lame, but that was a weak point of the novel as well.\r\n\r\nWhile this version and the 2004 one are the most faithful to Shelley\u2019s book, they each omit parts and change certain things. For instance, both omit Victor\u2019s traveling to Scotland and, later, Ireland, which was a good call. This version alters a certain character\u2019s death to a lynching while in the novel it was court-ordered hanging. Regardless, I enjoyed the surprise plot turn in the last act, which I\u2019m not going to give away. And the tragic ending is well executed. \r\n\r\n\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\" is similar to \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992) in that they both look awesome and were produced by Francis Ford Coppola. Any problems are due to translating convoluted 19th century gothic horror classics to modern cinema. \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 3 minutes, and was shot in England (Shepperton Studios) and the Swiss Alps.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+", "Kenneth Branagh made quite an artistic hit with his first film **HENRY V**. Next, he had great critical and financial success with his popcorn flick,** DEAD AGAIN**!  The success of both of those films meant he could take on any project he wanted.  He chose **MARY SHELLY'S FRANKENSTEIN**.  He would return to direct and star as Victor Frankenstein.  He would bring along many of his friends including Patrick Doyle to add another aggressive and bombastic score. Because of his newfound clout, he was able to bring in Oscar winning screenwriter Frank Darabont (**THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION**, **CRASH**).  Maybe his greatest display of the young directors status was bringing in Robert DeNiro to portray the creature!  The resulting film with all of this incredible talent is...\r\n\r\n_silly._\r\n\r\nI didn't have any good memories of the film in theaters in 1994.  Especially awkward was DeNiro's creature spinning toward the camera and yelling _\"Frankenstein!!!\"_ which brought nothing but laughter from the crowd.  I hoped my re-watch in 2022 would bring me a new perspective.  While there were there things I noticed that I now appreciated, the flick is still silly. \r\n\r\nIt must be said that Branagh's vision for the film is strong and clear.  Darabont's script is very clever and multi-faceted.  The music is excellent wall to wall support and some of the performances are noteworthy.  Unfortunately, much of the subtlety in Darabont's script is lost in the big, loud film.  Branagh's decision to showcase the birth of the creature as quasi-erotic is interesting, shirtless and sweating under firelight.  His decision to have the brilliant doctor, when exposing his feelings of guilt, loses his ability to speech clearly and seems to mimic the creatures meter.  We get it... who is actually the monster? Again, clear but over-the-top. Mostly missing are moments of circumspection and quiet.\r\n\r\nWith its big budget and generally beautiful lighting and cinematography, it would seem this would be the type of bad movie that is fun to watch.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work on that level either, as the film bounces between high art pretentiousness and lowest of gross out humor.\r\n\r\nI believe Branagh succeeded in getting his vision onto the screen and he has no reason to look down on his achievement. But as a big fan of his, I won't be with him with this monster.", "This could have been a far better interpretation of the wonderful story of the man-monster but it lacks potency. Frequently a problem when one of the stars is also the director; the focus becomes a bit blurred and in this - despite the super performance of Robert de Niro in the title role - the result is a rather meandering story devoid of the usual swathe of emotions \"Frankenstein\" usually evokes. Aiden Quinn is \"Walton\" an explorer obsessed with reaching the North Pole. When his ship collides with an iceberg, they are stranded only to encounter \"Victor\" (Kenneth Branagh) who proceeds to regale them with his story of how he, as a brilliant student attempted to cheat death by creating a creature restored from death. The scientist succeeds, but rejects his abhorrent creation to the elements expecting it to perish. It doesn't and is soon on it's own path of revenge on it's creator and on those whom he loves. To it's credit, it has none of the bolt-through-the-neck stuff; it is closer to the original story and has little of the James Whale to it; but it also lacks soul and \"humanity\". On paper, a great cast should have added depth to the story, but somehow there is just too much going on, the story is allowed to meander and the empathy and pity normally felt for the monster just saps away leaving us with quite an hollow shell of a recollection. The imagery is great, though - from the costumes and make-up through to the menacing lighting; all contributing well to the aesthetic of this tale of late 18th century science and morality. It's worth a watch, but this is still story that cinema needs to do more justice to."], ["Nice try from Raimi, but ultimately it creeps just above average.\r\n\r\nThe Western is a tough genre to tackle in the modern age, more so when it's post Dances With Wolves and  Unforgiven's masterclasses 101. But tackling both these challenges is nothing to the one which director Sam Raimi asks of the audience in his stab at the genre. \r\n\r\nA female gunslinger is here played by a Hollywood beauty, Sharon Stone, but she isn't right for the lead role. She obviously looks gorgeous and she broods and pouts better than most of her modern day peers, but she lacks a menacing streak, a bit of believable nastiness that just might have lifted the film to better heights. We understand and expect the vulnerability she shows, but to succeed here in the testosterone fuelled town of Redemption, she's going to have to convince as a tough gal. And Stone just isn't up to the task.\r\n\r\nThe film does have good points to enjoy though, very much so. The story, although gimmicky, works well as an entertaining popcorn munching tale, while the cast list reads like a whose who of solid and quality thespers,  (Gene Hackman wandering in from Unforgiven to play Little Bill's ghost, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DeCaprio, Keith David, Pat Hingle & Lance Henriksen). Also into the plus column is the always impressive cinematography from Dante Spinotti, and there is no denying Sam Raimi's keen eye for detail, with his zooming shots a real treat during the shoot out sequences - his Spaghetti Western leanings further enhanced by Alan Silvestri's pasta influenced score.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of this bravado attempt, and acknowledging that the makers have tried something different, The Quick & The Dead isn't quite quick enough on the draw to outlive the leading lady misstep. 6/10", "Now I saw this in the cinema in 1995 and had somehow managed to completely forget all about it - until I saw it again just last week and realised why. It's not that it is awful, it's just that it is so very derivative and very, very dependant on Gene Hackman (\"Herod\") who walks a fine line between menace and ham in a none too convincing fashion. He is running a to-the-death gun slinging competition - almost like one of the chivalric jousts of old - with the winner having to face him in the final shoot-out for an huge poke. Sharon Stone (\"Ellen\") arrives in his dingy town just at the start of the process determined to avenge her father's killer; Russell Crowe is \"Cort\", a preacher who also has a pretty violent past and \"the Kid\" (Leonardo di Caprio) who has the clear belief that his youth and skill make him all but immortal are all coaxed, cajoled and threatened into participating in this game of death. Sam Raimi has all the ingredients of a great little western adventure, but the cast don't work well together at all. Stone is well past her potent best and the usual guy-with-a-grudge theme is now so hackneyed as to render this little better than a series of gunfights with characters about whom I could not care less. The cinematography and some of the photographic styles are interesting, though - the film has a classy look to it and Alan Silvestri creates some tension with his slightly untypical (for a western) score; but the whole is nowhere near the sum of the parts leaving us with something that now, more than ever, just looks like it's been made for telly."], [], [], [], ["These drug cartels represent a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States. \r\n\r\nThe third outing for Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan - and the second with Harrison Ford in the lead - is a tightly constructed political thriller.

Naturally all is a bit suspect in the American corridors of power, leading to corruption and abuse of power that puts Jack Ryan firmly at the front to sift and destroy the bad eggs staining the American Star Spangled Banner.\r\n\r\nThis very much plays out for those who like a bit of politico subterfuge, whist being ok with long passages of like minded chatter is also a requisite. That we have a fine cast playing out the screenplay (Donald E. Stewart, Steven Zaillian and John Milius) is a big plus that gives credibility to the shifty machinations.\r\n\r\nThere's a nagging annoyance throughout that this still should be a better film, especially given the overstretched run time of 2 hours 20 minutes, and the computer sections are dubious and the finale is something of a damp squib. However, we are in the company of great pros, both in front of and behind the camera - and also on the page (Clancy's brain superlative).

All of the scenes on the bus were great and while the finale was fine, the third act in of itself was contrived.

While it\u2019s not great like \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day\u201d (1991) it\u2019s arguably on par with \u201cUnder Siege 2: Dark Territory\u201d (1995). \r\n\r\nAlthough a top-of-the-line production, it lacks the human interest of \u201cTerminator 2\u201d and \u201cRunaway Train\u201d (1985) and the story is unbelievably contrived.

He must track down the bus and figure out a way of ensuring, in a gridlocked and pedestrian-riddled LA, how to make sure it doesn't explode and how to evacuate the passengers. Luckily for him, Sandra Bullock (\"Annie\") is on board so perhaps he has a fighting chance? We know from the start that it's explosive expert Dennis Hopper pulling all the strings - boy has he got a grudge - so the rest of LAPD (and his partner Jeff Daniels) have to try and track him down. Mark Mancina's score and some really intense action photography keep this gripping drama racing along really well with loads of (ok, pretty implausible) engineering acrobatics. The dynamic between Bullock and Reeves is effective, she plays her role really entertainingly too as it turns out the bus has it's fair share of quirky passengers too, and she ends up doing all the driving (without a driving licence!).

Whilst at the rescue centre he is called to help a group who are stranded in the mountains, he agrees to help out this one last time, unaware that the group in the mountains are heavily armed murderous thieves and they need help of another kind...\r\n\r\nDirected by Renny Harlin, this is one of those films that shows that Stallone once had box office clout as big as his bodily frame. It's a delightful no brain action film that delivers royally to those with a bent for the action genre. What really lifts Clifhanger above average is the wonderful use of suspenseful situations. The film opens with a quite breath taking sequence and then kicks on to literally have us hanging on by our fingernails. The bad guys are deliciously over the top, none more so than the bullishly nasty John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, whilst Sly gets beefcake support from the ever reliable Michael Rooker. Cinematography by Alex Thomson is gorgeous as he brings to life the Cortina d'Ampezzo area of the Dolomites in Italy. Score is by Trevor Jones, who keeps it orchestral as he lifts from his own work for Last of the Mohicans, which in turn is mixed with what sounds like the lead theme of Alan Silvestri's work on Predator.\r\n\r\nSlam bang action, tense fraught moments, and a script written with knowing tongue in cheek persuasion, Cliffhanger literally does ROCK. 7.5/10", "When a rescue atop a mountain goes wrong, a girl is killed and her boyfriend \"Tucker\" (Michael Rooker) blames his partner \"Walker\" (Sylvester Stallone) for the tragedy.

The film is exactly what it says it is, and delivers what it promises.\r\n\r\nThe script isn't particularly smart, and the story has enough improbable points to make us really doubt it. However, it serves the purposes of the film perfectly, even having some moments of humor. The film is far from being good, but it has a cast of good actors: Sylvester Stallone is good at acting, but he was never good at playing characters, and that doesn't change in this film. Even so, he's good enough to handle the role and have the lead. John Lithgow also does a satisfying job, but the rest of the cast is average. The villains are\u2026 likable, to be honest.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film takes advantage of the generous budget for very good and well-executed action scenes, with great physical demand from the stuntmen and great commitment from the special effects, visual and sound sectors. There's an exaggeration that makes everything feel sensational, kitschy and a little silly, and the dialogues are absolute clich\u00e9s, but they add fun and some more witty moments to the film.

Laraine Newman and Jane Curtin were very underrated as comediennes, and the unsung heroes that held the cast together during its excellent run of the early days.\r\n\r\nWhat's hardly ever talked about, when it comes to movies based on SNL skits, is how important the supporting players are. 'Coneheads' undoubtedly has the strongest supporting cast of any of them, and while director Barron has hardly become a household name in terms of movies (only this and 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' really hit the radar), his prowess on some of the greatest music videos of all time (ie., Dire Straits' 'Money for Nothing', Michael Jackson's 'Billie Jean' and A-Ha's 'Take On Me') was picture-perfect for the comedic set-pieces here.

It stars Hugh Grant, Ian McNeice, Tara Fitzgerald, Colm Meaney and Kenneth Griffith. Music is by Stephen Endelman and cinematography by Vernon Layton.\r\n\r\nSet in 1917, plot finds Grant and McNeice as two English cartographers who arrive in the Welsh village of Ffynnon Garw to measure what the locals proudly proclaim to be Wales' first mountain. However, it turns out that the \"mountain\" is 16 feet below the required 1000 feet requisite so therefore can only be classed as a hill. This news causes disgust amongst the locals, who then set about stopping the cartographers going home whilst they attempt to build atop of the hill to make it over 1000 feet.\r\n\r\nA film with a big title that is matched by the size of its heart, Monger's film owes much to those fun community based pictures that filed out of Ealing Studios back in the 40s and 50s, Re: Whisky Galore! and The Titfield Thunderbolt. We can also safely place it the whimsy category where something as wonderful as Local Hero sits, while the old British comedy staple that encompasses an obsession with size (The Mouse That Roared) watches over the film like an approving British cinematic angel.\r\n\r\nHomespun humour marries up with the utterly engaging view of quirky village life to provide us with just under 100 minutes of entertainment. Although clearly simple in plot and structure, to simply dismiss it as such does not do justice to the fine work of the ensemble cast and the writing of Ivor and Chris Monger. With Grant doing what he does best, the amiable nervous fop, picture has a lead actor fully comfortable with the tone and texture of the production, while around him there are a number of fine character actors putting delightful meat on the comedy bones of oddball characters with names such as Morgan the Goat, Johny Shellshock, William the Petroleum and Betty from Cardiff! Best of the bunch is Griffith as Reverend Jones, a grumpy, stubborn eccentric who underpins everything so wonderfully skew-whiff about life in Ffynnon Garw.\r\n\r\nAs for the writing? The screenplay has a wonderful ear for small village dialogue, while in amongst the value of community spirit theme, sits a near sombre observation of the effects of war on such a community. The production design is appealing, with Layton's photography around the Powys locations a visual treat, and Endelman's music has a suitably warming and jaunty feel; even if it starts to get a touch repetitive later in the piece. It doesn't have widespread appeal, it's clearly a film aimed at a small portion of film fans that love those films mentioned earlier.

Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart), an adventurous photographer, is temporarily immobilized by a serious leg injury.  Bored, and living in a time where TV and internet were not available as distractions, he watches the courtyard out his real window and speculates about the lives of the neighbors that he sees.  In particular, he wonders whether his neighbor Thorvald (Raymond Burr, who actually looks older than his later character Perry Mason) may have killed his wife.\r\n\r\nHitchcock examines the situation from numerous points of view.  At one extreme, Jeff could be considered a brilliant detective who sleuths out a case based purely on close observation.  At the other end, he could be considered a voyeur and a paranoid whose suspicions could damage other people.  These interpretations are voiced by his acquaintances, including his nurse (Thelma Ritter) and his fiance  (Grace Kelly, the future Princess Grace of Monaco).  In the end physical evidence is found that settles the Thorvald case but leaves Jeff's motivation still in question.\r\n\r\nHitchcock takes advantage of the situation to introduce numerous subplots -- but they're MINIMALIST subplots, where the audience only sees what Jeff sees from his window.  (Mild spoilers follow)  Newlyweds quarrel, a depressed woman considers suicide but is rescued by a neighbor; a sexy girl (\"Miss Torso\") turns out to be not a party girl but devoted to an absent boyfriend. \r\n\r\nAn entertaining thing about this movie is that we have numerous actors -- Stewart, Kelly, and Burr -- who are to become more famous for later movies and incidents.", "It Had To Be Murder. \r\n\r\nL.B. Jefferies is a wheelchair bound photographer who by way of relieving his boredom, starts observing the lives of all his neighbours from his apartment window. As he gets deeper into the lives of all around him, he becomes convinced that one of hem has committed the act of murder, thus putting himself and those close to him in mortal danger.\r\n\r\nMuch like most of Alfred Hitchcock's other lauded pictures, Rear Window has been dissected, examined, appraised and written about by far more versed people than myself, a mere film fanatic. So how do I even start to write a review of a film that I view as one of Hitchcock's best? Well maybe I should just write what I like about it without delving into psycho babble and a deconstruction of the human psyche and all its little offshoots! So I will!.\r\n\r\nRear Window is adapted by Alfred Hitchcock and his writer John Michael Hayes, from the Cornell Woolrich story called It Had To Be Murder/Murder From A Fixed Viewpoint. The film of course forces us the viewers to become voyeurs, watching a newly hooked voyeur go about his business. Quite a neat trick from Hitchcock, and one can reasonably assume that the maestro director was chuckling with glee within his genius girth.\r\n\r\nWorking from the confines of a single set, Hitchcock has molded a suspenseful, intriguing, cheeky and sexy picture, with a top line cast giving the smart screenplay the performances it deserved. What is often forgot by those more concerned with the psychological aspects of Rear Window is the blatant irony of L.B. Jefferies situation, his obsession with the neighbours is not confined to a probable case of murder, his interest first and foremost is with the love lives of those he observes, thus forcing (excusing) him to acknowledge the love from the woman who so wants to be in his life!\r\n\r\nIt's also important to note the merits of each character of the piece, those that visit Jefferies and the conversations that take place, even the suspected murderer has a bemused interest pouring from his very frame. Rarely has a film been produced that has every single character having a critical element to the story. Then there is the ending where Hitchcock and his team weave all strands together to leave us wryly smiling away whilst simultaneously feeling that we have been had by the big director, and be under no illusions here, we have been at the mercy of a genius and party to a film of unquestionable quality. 10/10", "Probably have seen this a half dozen times over the years and still is my favorite Hitchcock movie, favorite mind you not best.

Grace Kelly (his girlfriend) thinks this all a bit too prurient for her but is slowly drawn into his web of intrigue and ends up an active participant with his investigations as we now have a great conspiracy theory thriller.

Also angling for that last seat on the bus is the roguish \"Warne\" (Clark Gable) - a journalist with a nose for a good story. Determined to track her down, her father uses his media empire and soon her photo is all over the press. This doesn't go unnoticed by the shrewd \"Warne\", who soon reckons her story is worth a load of cash to his editor. What neither reckon on though, is that their initial hostility/indifference to each other gradually morphs into something - well, yes, you can guess that bit. Indeed, the story itself has a degree of predictability to it - but that doesn't matter here. This is a quickly paced, well written comedy drama that utilises the intimacy of the bus (or the motels) to provide an excellent vehicle for two actors who just exude a joyous chemistry - never a romantic, or sentimental one - as they try to stay one step ahead of the blokes sent by her father to return her to safety and to her affianced \"King Wesley\" (Jameson Thomas) who is the latest cause of the familial discord (her father loathes this opportunist fellow). Tables are turned and turned again as each try to outmanoeuvre the other - with Walter Connolly turning in quite an engaging performance as the dad who also knows there is more than one way to skin a cat. This might be my favourite Gable outing - he had a lovely smile and glint in his eye for comedy parts when he was enjoying himself and Colbert is also at the top of her game for a thoroughly enjoyable and spirited look at human nature and bloody-mindedness."], ["A bit of cake and a song to blow away the wind of change.\r\n\r\nA film that is firmly ticking all the boxes for those looking for a family classic to admire and tap your feet along with.

When the Father is requested to move to New York permanently with his job, the rest of the family are not that keen to leave their memories and their beloved home in St. Louis, and in to the mix is the varying degrees of blossoming love involving the elder daughters and their respective beaus.\r\n\r\nThis film is just so gorgeous on many fronts, the colour beautifully realises the tremendous scope director Vincent Minnelli brings with his recreation of the era, the attention to detail is quality supreme. The story is good and earthy, a sort of tale to have the viewer hankering for the good old days before the world got itself in one big hurry. The songs are crackers, enjoy standards such as The Boy Next Door, The Trolley Song, and the simply precious Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.

It is an engaging early 20th century bit of Americana - a charming costume drama peppered with gentle comedy, some fantastic songs, and Judy Garland probably the most comfortable in any role that I have sever seen her play (except, perhaps in \"Easter Parade\" released 4 years later in 1948). The story is set across a year in the life of the well-to-do \"Smith\" family from St. Louis. Mary Astor and Leon Ames try to raise their daughters \"Esther\" (Garland), \"Rose\" (Lucille Bremer) and the youngest, \"Tootie\" (Margaret O'Brien), whom I have to say stole most of the scenes the she was in (and I really don't like children in films). It tackles courtship - and a fairly clumsily carried out courtship at that - with Tom Drake (\"Truett\") and the poor men in the family - son \"Lon Jr.\" (Henry Daniels) and \"Grandpa\" (Harry Davenport) are consistently run rings around... \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\", \"The Trolley Song\" and \"Skip to My Lou\" keep the toes-a-tapping - well maybe not the first one, so much - and the ensemble provide for a colourful, entertaining piece of cinema that Vincente Minnelli can be proud of. Sure it is a bit gloopy at times, but that's part of the overall sentiment of the film so if you have any cynical bones in your body - perhaps this is not for you."], ["This classic is a must with great dialogues and script with a great performance from Bette Davis.", "Excellent performances by everyone, especially Bette Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders, which kept me captivated more so than the story, though the dialogue was amazing. Nothing fantastic all in all but still entertaining. **4.0/5**", "**Fasten your seat belts: this is one of the best films of the 20th century.**\r\n\r\nThere aren't many perfect movies: At least, I don't know many. However, this film is almost certainly one of them. The result of an ideal combination of factors, which harmoniously came together to make it a work of art, it is a timeless film that is as pleasantly watched today as it was fifty years ago. But when we talk about classic films, it's far from being one of the first to come to mind. What is the reason? It's hard to explain, but I feel like the film never really touched the hearts of the general public. The film deserves more attention these days and is worth seeing. I'm not one of those who measure the quality of a film by the awards it receives (although that is always an indicant to consider as to quality)... but the film is one of the most nominated for the Oscars, with fourteen nominations, something that has only rarely been equaled, and six statuettes won, including Best Picture.\r\n\r\nThe film begins by showing us a ceremony in which an actress, Eve, receives an important award for her performance in the theater. Then, the action goes back a year to, in flashback, let us know everything that happened until that moment. And that's how we follow the rise of Eve, an aspiring actress from obscure origins who manages to arouse the pity and sympathy of Margo Channing, then the biggest star of the stages. The film explores the two characters well, and the way they relate to each other. Eve is quite ambiguous for part of the movie, and even after we see the darker side of the character. Margo seems like a very insufferable shrew, but the character has a good heart, hidden under tons of ego and big theater diva tics.\r\n\r\nBased on a short story and intelligently developed by Joseph Mankiewicz, the director who will ensure the script, the film has an excellent cast and memorable dialogues, full of quotable phrases that we've probably heard somewhere. The cast is powerfully led by Bette Davis, an extremely talented, charismatic and full of personality actress who gave her all in this film, managing to achieve here, in my perspective, her work of glory. The difference between Margo, the character, and Davis, the real person, is so thin that you can almost say that the actress has taken the character and brought it a little bit into her own life. It's a truly superb dramatic exercise, and the same applies to the one given to us by its co-star, Anne Baxter, who plays Eve. The way they both collaborate in their scenes is mesmerizing. I also really liked Celeste Holm, George Sanders and Hugh Marlowe, even though the men in this cast aren't as strong as their female counterparts.\r\n\r\nBeing a black and white film, this might be a bit off-putting to current audiences, but it's not something I see as a problem. On the contrary, I really liked the cinematography and I think the film has a lot of elegance and visual beauty. There are some scenes and camera movements that I found strange, but I think some are really unusual in films from this era. As for the costumes, I really liked the way they fit the story, and some of the actresses' costumes and dresses are pieces worthy of haute couture. The film has some implicit humor, which can escape the most inattentive, like that piano piece that Davis, intoxicated, listens to several times, later calling it \u201ccheap sentimentality\u201d.", "Celeste Holm (\"Karen\") takes pity on stage-door groupie \"Eve\" (Ann Baxter) when, after the umpteenth time, she encounters her hanging around waiting for the departure of stage star \"Margo Channing\" (Bette Davis). She decides to take her in and introduce her to her feisty idol. \"Channing\" - despite the rather brusque protestations of her assistant \"Birdie\" (a lovely effort from Thelma Ritter) - and writer \"Richards\" (Hugh Marlowe) take a bit of a shine to this endearing young woman who proceeds to regale them with a rather sad story explaining her current predicament. Next thing we know, \"Eve\" has ingratiated herself into the home of her new - and increasingly frustrated - mentor, and - well is she quite what she seems? Davis is at the top of here game in this drama. Her characterisation of the ageing star is potent and poignant - especially when she hosts a welcome home party for her soon-to-be husband \"Simpson\" (Gary Merrill) and the \"fasten your seatbelts\" quote is unleashed to devastating cinematic effect. Holm is also really quite effective as the conduit between these two women, but it is really Baxter who steals the show. You just know she can't be as pure and innocent, as sweetness and light as she portrays. Luckily, we have the dastardly critic \"Addison DeWitt\" (possibly a career best supporting performance from George Sanders) on hand to help keep the audience ahead of the plotting and scheming and also to ensure a certain amount of divine retribution is doled out as required at the end. This is a cracking drama with six principal characters left to develop and evolve in front of us exposing all that is good and bad about human nature and nurture. Joseph L. Mankiewicz adapts and allows Mary Orr's pithy and sharp story to accumulate gently but powerfully and even though it starts as it finishes, robbing the denouement of a touch of jeopardy, it's still one hell of a star-studded \"bumpy' ride."], ["A good movie and interesting plot but the characters are a little bit exaggerated and the outcome is quite expectable.", "A poor \"lady's companion\", so self-effacing that we are never given her name (Joan Fontaine), suddenly finds her life changed when a moody widower, Maxim de Winter  (Laurence Olivier), proposes to marry her and take her to his splendid estate of Manderley.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a fairy-tale turned true, but it is not.  On reaching Manderley, the new Mrs. de Winter  (still unnamed) finds herself out of place, as Maxim seems to drift away and the hostile housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) repeatedly tells her that she will never live up to the standard set by Maxim's first wife Rebecca.\r\n\r\nWhat was Rebecca really like?   The perfect English lady, or a hypocrite who dazzled the people around her?   Where do Maxim's affections really lie?  The questions not only create a great movie mystery, but a portrait of an unequal marriage between an arrogant aristocrat and a neurotically dependent young wife.", "Absolutely perfect Gothic Thriller that has many imitators but few of equal quality.\r\n\r\nWith \"Rebecca\" about to hit the Broadway stage (as a musical!), I thought it was time to write my review of perhaps my favorite Hitchcock film. I recall the first time I saw this on TV almost 30 years ago on the late show, I had set my VCR to tape it, but woke up to start watching a bit of it, and stayed up all night to watch it all. That's how good a film it is. Daphne Du Maurier's tale of a shy companion who shocks her employer by winning the most desired wealthy widow in England is gripping, suspenseful, and filled with innuendo. Joan Fontaine never gave a more lovely performance as the awkward bride who leaves her hysterically selfish employer (Florence Bates) to marry the brooding Maxim De Winter (Laurence Olivier) and finds animosity from the darkly dressed Mrs. Danver (Judith Anderson) who resents her intrusion because of her devotion to Maxim's late wife, Rebecca. The mystery of how Rebecca died and what kind of woman she really was is explored, and with the intrusion of scoundrel George Sanders and some well-meaning advice from Maxim's toothy sister (Gladys Cooper), the new Mrs. De Winter (her first name is never revealed) finds out more than she bargained for.\r\n\r\nIf you thought Olivier's Heathcliff in \"Wuthering Heights\" was dark and somewhat depressing, wait until you meet his more civilized Maxim. Joan Fontaine's bride is as far from Merle Oberon's \"wild and sweet\" Cathy as you can find, but as far as Gothic tales of brooding men and their lost souls go, the two movies make a perfect double feature. Samuel Goldwyn and David Selznick were Hollywood's most famous independent producers, so sometimes their careers are compared. They share many of the same players, and in the case of these two films, the same photographer (Gregg Toland). Fontaine and Olivier work well on screen together, even though they apparently did not share a close working relationship. It is, however, the supporting players who are the shining stars. \r\n\r\nAnderson's Mrs. Danvers is a role we've already seen on screen (usually played by Gale Sondergaard), but being Anderson's second film (and first in 7 years), there was a lot of curiosity surrounding her considering her reputation as one of Broadway's hottest dramatic actresses. Mrs. Danvers isn't a one dimensional evil housekeeper; You understand her affection for the late Rebecca from the very beginning, and in every movement Anderson makes, you cannot take your eyes off of her. I can't praise her highly enough. Sanders' suave villain (who playfully calls Mrs. Danvers \"Danny\") is extremely likable and almost equal in stealing away the attention of the leads. Gladys Cooper and Nigel Bruce add on a delightful \"pip pip\" quality to their eccentric characters, while in her brief time on screen, Florence Bates is hysterically funny, putting out a cigarette in her cold cream, and coolly telling Fontaine how she can never truly be a \"great lady\".\r\n\r\nEvery moment here is a classic movie memory, from the opening narration to Fontaine's first vision of De Winter, and then, the rainy ride down to where Fontaine sees Mandalay for the first time. The light first quarter darkens the moment we see Anderson pop into view as Mrs. Danvers. A cold pause, then \"How Do You Do\" reveals the tension, and from there, everything is set. Anderson explodes in two scenes-the first where she finds the hiding Fontaine in Rebecca's old room, and later, when Fontaine confronts Anderson after discovering her treachery. The film sags just a bit with the discovery of a body that might be Rebecca's, but that is minor. C. Aubrey Smith is memorable in his small role as Maxim's attorney. The final shot will live on in your memory, just as Mandalay lived on in the second Mrs. De Winter's.\r\n\r\nWhile \"Rebecca\" won Best Film at that year's Academy Awards, many film historians prefer the message drama \"The Grapes of Wrath\" as the better film. I find the two rank very close, and also quibble over between the choice of Jane Darwell for Supporting Actress over Anderson's Mrs. Danvers. A big mistake was not nominating Sanders. A BBC version years later is also very good, a bit more faithful to the novel, and benefits from Diana Rigg as a more approachable Mrs. Danvers and a very diva-ish performance by Faye Dunaway in the Florence Bates role.", "Do you think the dead come back and watch the living? \r\n\r\nRebecca is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted to screen play from the Daphne du Maurier novel of the same name. It stars Laurence Olvier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson. Cinematography is by George Barnes and music scored by Franz Waxman. \r\n\r\nAfter meeting and marrying 'Maxim' de Winter (Olivier), the Second Mrs. de Winter (Fontaine), finds life at his English estate, Manderley, far from comfortable because the servants and the house serve to remind her of the first Mrs. de Winter, whose death remains a source of mystery. What did happen to the first lady of the house? Can this newly married couple survive the oppressive cloud that looms large over the mansion? \r\n\r\nA Gothic emotional near masterpiece, Alfred Hitchcock's first American film may seem a bit too serviceable at times, something he was also aware of himself, but the production values are high and the story is played out supremely well. Within the story we can find Hitchcock's now famous trait of mistrusting Women, but in the main it stays the tragic tale of one young woman living in the ominous shadow of the previous Mrs. De Winter. Mood is often set as foreboding, with the director understanding the psychological pangs of the source material once the action switches to the de Winter home of Manderley. It arguably is a touch too long, and the restraint of Hitchcock, down to producer David O. Selznick overseeing things, stops it being a bit more unnerving than it should be. \r\n\r\nFor Manderley the mansion here is one of the finest put on the screen, this is because Hitchcock and brilliant cinematographer George Barnes manage to make it bold & beautiful one minute, and then the next scene it comes off as a monolithic nightmare. It's wonderful case of the surroundings playing the extra character for maximum effect. Laurence Olivier is impressive, even if we would learn later on that this is the sort of performance he could do in his sleep. The supporting cast do great work as well, especially as regards the cold and terrifying turn from Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. However, to me this will always be Joan Fontaine's show, she nails it perfectly, the new Mrs. De Winter wants to do right but can't seem to so for doing wrong, she infuriates at times, yet the next minute you just want to hold her, for she's so vulnerable, but beautifully so, it's a brilliant performance in a brilliant film. \r\n\r\nThe ending is a switheroo from the novel, and it almost derails the success the film has achieved up to that point. And looking at it now it's hard not to curse the Production Code for enforcing a big change to what was revealed in du Maurier's wonderful novel. But the film has survived the \"appeasing\" ending to stand the test of time for all the ages. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Barnes also won for Best Black & White Cinematography, it was nominated for a further nine awards, including Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. No nomination for Waxman, sadly, but his score is worthy of a mention for the evocative strains that sit nicely with the tone of the story. Rebecca, a hauntingly beautiful picture that's acted and produced with consummate skill. 9.5/10", "We saw this quite recently on the big screen at Somerset House in London. One of those outdoor screenings - and the fact that it poured with rain on hundreds of us didn't matter one jot (though the hampers got quite sodden). Olivier and the eerily stupendous Judith Anderson provide the ultimate in sophisticated horror partnerships and make this by far my favourite Hitchcock film. Joan Fontaine is an expert at conveying the naive, adoring vulnerability of the second \"Mrs. de Winter\", combatting a foe she cannot hope to defeat and George Sanders is almost as sinister as he makes up the quartet in this bleak, frightening and totally enthralling two hours of cinema.", "**One of the greatest films of Hitchcock's career.**\r\n\r\nAlfred Hitchcock was truly a master, and there are not many directors who can present a CV so vast, so rich and so deserving of acclaim. Ironically, he did not win a single Oscar for his work as a director and even this film, which was one of the most awarded in his work, only won two Oscars (Best Film and Best Black-and-White Cinematography) at the 1941 ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe film was produced by David O. Selznick through his own studio, which was then busy completing and releasing \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d. He had acquired the film rights to the original novel, by Daphne du Maurier, and hoped that Hitchcock would be faithful to the material. He reluctantly agreed, but imposed his deeply detailed working methods, significantly delaying filming, which was just one of the points of friction between producer and director. Things got to the point where Hitchcock banned Selznick from \u201chis\u201d studio and prevented his interference, filming only what he thought he was going to use in order to restrict the final cut.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying, I believe, that Hitchcock gave us another memorable work worthy of every cinephile's bookshelf. The cinematography, in black and white, is modeled with great care and beauty, using some very innovative techniques for the time. The soundtrack also works wonderfully and is very atmospheric. The mansion's sets and costumes were also points in which the production invested a lot and applied itself, in order to provide greater realism. It appears that the exterior of the house was, in fact, a scale model.\r\n\r\nThe script is impressively effective: after a quick courtship, a very rich man marries a young woman from modest origins and takes her to his impressive mansion. However, he was a recent widower, and the house is filled with disturbing memories of his previous marriage, as if his first wife still roams around, and could become a palpable presence that threatens to tear the couple apart. There are more elements in between, such as the housekeeper's strange obsession with her previous boss, to whom she devoted a bizarre loyalty, and the deepening of the mysteries leads to a surprising ending, so it's worth not reading anything about the film before watching see it in its entirety. Of course, if we think about it, it becomes incomprehensible that, with a new wife, that man kept the housekeeper in his house, along with all the objects that belonged to the deceased...\r\n\r\nJoan Fontaine was chosen for the main character, giving us a quality, very convincing performance. She seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown for a huge period of time and that is what certainly earned her the Oscar for Best Actress for this work, one of the best in her career. Laurence Olivier also does a good job and, despite hating Fontaine's choice (he pressured the production to give the role to his real-life partner, Vivien Leigh) and not having a good, friendly relationship with her colleague, he is extraordinarily competent when they are on stage together. Judith Anderson also deserves praise for her work.", "We saw this quite recently on the big screen at Somerset House in London. One of those outdoor screenings - and the fact that it poured with rain on hundreds of us didn't matter one jot (though the hampers got quite sodden). Olivier and the eerily stupendous Judith Anderson provide the ultimate in sophisticated horror partnerships and make this by far my favourite Hitchcock film. Joan Fontaine is an expert at conveying the naive, adoring vulnerability of the second \"Mrs. de Winter\", combatting a foe she cannot hope to defeat and George Sanders is almost as sinister as he makes up the quartet in this bleak, frightening and totally enthralling two hours of cinema."], ["This intriguing little crime/thriller from the great Alfred Hitchcock isn't half bad.  It's a more unusual Hitch effort, but the story has plenty of twists and turns to keep interest.  Ingrid plays a kindhearted psychologist who falls in love with the new doctor at the asylum where she's working, but he may not be all that he seems.  I'm sorry, Ms. Bergman; it looks like you've fallen in love with a psycho.", "When Leo G. Carroll (\"Dr. Murchison\") steps down as director of the \"Green Manors\" - a centre for psychoanalysis, he is replaced by Gregory Peck (\"Dr. Edwardes\") who immediately attracts the attention - romantic and professional - of Ingrid Bergman (\"Dr. Petersen\") who quickly discovers that he has quite a secret. Together they must work speedily to unravel a mystery of memory and murder before the authorities come to their own conclusions. This isn't my favourite Hitchcock thriller - Peck hasn't quite got the charisma or intensity the part required and though Bergman is beautiful; she is still just a little too stilted, unnatural even. The plot, however is complex and intriguing dealing with a traditional crime-noir subject in a far more cerebral manner. Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3sza's Oscar winning score adds much of the menace to this and the pace smoulders nicely to a suitably thoughtful conclusion. I know Peck was David O. Selznick's golden boy at this point, but I cannot help but think he let's the thing down a bit; perhaps Hitch should have cast a more characterful lead? Great stuff, nonetheless though - certainly worth a watch."], [], ["Thank heavens, for musicals.\r\n\r\nBased on Anita Loos' play, out of the novel written by Colette, Gigi snatched a ream of Academy Awards and promptly became the course of much debate and criticism for ever and a day it seems. The problem, as most musical aficionados will attest, is that Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe rehashed their previous stage hit \r\n\"My Fair Lady\". Which to an extent is true, hell they even slotted in one of \"My Fair Lady's\" thrown away songs, \"Say A Prayer For Me Tonight\", into Gigi's bubbly mix. But on its own terms, Gigi is still a vibrant and rewarding picture that holds up well with each passing year.\r\n\r\nThe story had already been done as a French film directed by Jacqueline Audry in 1950, and a year later it had been played dramatically straight on Broadway with Audrey Hepburn in the title role. So for sure it was already a well formed story. Lerner & Loewe merely added their \"Fair Lady\" formula, got the talented Vincente Minnelli to direct it and broke out from the studio to utilise the Parisian locations. A touch heavy at almost two hours long, one still can't help getting wrapped up in some wonderful tunes and Cecil Beaton's gorgeous period costumes. The cast may be a mixed bunch, with it at times feeling like a competition to see who can be the most \"French,\" but with the spiky dialogue being wry and tart, and one of \"those\" finales, it's a winner and highly recommended to fans of the musical genre. 7/10"], ["Yeah, dames are always pulling a switch on you. \r\n\r\nOtto Preminger's wonderfully crafted mystery has become something of a big favourite of many people over the years, and rightly so. But just what is it that makes the film so watchable after all these years?\r\n\r\nSure the cast is solid, but I personally wouldn't say spectacular. Gene Tierney simmers and holds it together whilst Clifton Webb, Dana Andrews & Vincent Price are perfectly admirable in their roles as guys in drippy infatuation with Tierney's vibrant title character. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the success of the piece is with the screenplay? Adapted by at least \"five\" known writers from the novel by Vera Caspary, it is in truth delightfully bonkers! You have shades of necrophilia, potential gay suitors, and the girl the boys all court is dead, minus her face after a shotgun assault. Then there is the fact that Laura bends the conventions of the genres it can each sit in. Is it film noir, a who done it, a ghost story or just a plane old detective story? Does it matter? No, not really, because it's the ambiguity that is the films strength. As for Laura Hunt herself, well she's no femme fatale, in fact she's an ordinary woman, yet the men are in awe of her. It shouldn't work on the surface, but it does, very much so.\r\n\r\nThe film had something of a troubled shoot, hires and fires and jiggled endings were abound. Preminger was originally the producer for the film but was hired after Fox head honcho Darryl Zanuck fired Rouben Mamoulian. He in turn replaced cinematographer Lucian Ballard with Joseph LaShelle (who won the Academy Award for his efforts). Regardless, what we have with the finished product is a cheeky and often twisted tale of obsession. A film where one can never be sure what is actually going to develop, right up to, and including, the final denouement. 8/10"], ["Capra adapts James Hilton's Utopian novel with grace and beauty.\r\n\r\nIt's so nice to be able to see something resembling the original vision Capra had for this story, the wonders of science gives us a cracking restoration to enjoy at our want.\r\n\r\nRobert Conway is a British diplomat who helps a group of people (one his younger brother) escape from a Chinese revolution in a passenger plane, all doesn't go to plan, though, as the plane has been skyjacked and is heading into the Himalayas, and Tibet. The plane crash lands due to the pilot becoming stricken, and after the passengers get out they are greeted by a party of people belonging to the Valley Of The Blue Moon, to which is a beautiful and peaceful world known as Shangri-La.\r\n\r\nShangri-La is gorgeous, there is no illness there, no war or hostility, the landscape is paradise on earth, people live far longer than is deemed possible in the outside world, it is utopia in everyone's wildest dreams. Here Conway and the group, after initial scepticism, come to love the place and have no desire to leave this haven that is shut off from the outside world. That is, all except the younger Conway (George), and as is always the case in large social communities, cracks begin to emerge and questions remain unanswered.\r\n\r\nThe film has a wonderful dreamy quality about it, it's filmed firmly with romantic fantasy intention, and the quality of the production really helps to emphasise this intriguing story. The sets are gorgeous, the music is perfectly on tempo throughout, and the acting is top notch, while the love Capra had for the topic is evident in every frame. Thankfully all of the great work on the film has the story to match, and it's the story, and the subsequent turn of events in the last third, that is ultimately the film's crowning glory.

William Powell as the hobo Godfrey hits all the right notes. Carole Lombard is terrific, if slightly over the top, as Irene Bullock, the \"uptown girl looking for a downtown man.\"\r\n\r\nWhat starts as an innocent city scavenger hunt becomes an unlikely romance when Irene Bullock brings home a gentlemanly bum named Godfrey and gets him hired as the new butler. Godfrey turns the household upside down (without really trying), much to the disapproval of Irene's stuffy parents (Eugene Pallette and Alice Brady). \r\n\r\nIt is a shame that its style and intelligence is lost on much of today's audience, who have become so used to the usual dull, CGI-packed drivel that it is difficult for them to sit through a film like this. Brimming with wit and sophistication, this screwball comedy with a message is not to be missed.\r\n\r\nRecommended to you by yours truly, P.M. Turner of Old Hat Cinema.", "I see a room full of empty headed nitwits! \r\n\r\nIf I was the sort of person who scrutinised every frame of my viewings looking for flaws, then I still wouldn't have issue here because My Man Godfrey has no cracks in its make up. It is perfect cinema from a golden age that we rarely see in this day and age. During a rich person's socialite scavenger hunt, air head Irene Bullock wins the contest to see who can find a forgotten man, a hobo, and showcase him at the toffs party. She falls for the charisma of down and out Godfrey Parke and gives him the job of Butler to the family Bullock. This of course bemuses the family, even more so when Godfrey turns out to be far more than they originally thought.\r\n\r\nMy Man Godfrey is one of those old classic comedies that has satire at its heart, for here the rich are firmly in the target sights of the makers, and it's they who come across as bumbling buffoons. Godfrey the hobo is the one with tact and grace, and it is he who is the one they all should take their markers from. Yet as important as the social message is, and it is, it's the brilliant comedy that shines bright and comes to the fore. This is an electric script benefiting from great work from all involved who put the words onto film.\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell is Godfrey, it's a perfect performance as he is never flustered as he delivers the funny lines with caustic impact. Carole Lombard is just precious as the dopey love sick Irene, making her interplay with Powell as comedy gold. My favourite of the bunch, though, is Eugene Palette as Alexander, the father of this bizarro family, every mannerism and every line out of his mouth had me in utter stitches. I must also mention that of the 6 Oscars the film was nominated for, I'm stunned there wasn't one for Gail Patrick as Cornelia, it's devilishly icy and weasel like, and she impacted hard on me to the point that I wanted to strangle her, job done, a great performance from her.\r\n\r\nTruth is, they are all great, from the actors to the director, from the editor to the writer, My Man Godfrey is a truly brilliant film that easily entered my top 100 greatest films list today. 10/10", "I am not one of those people who say that they don\u2019t make movies like they used to, or who watches a lot of classic black and white films. But there are a few dozen classics I would watch any time they come on, and this is one of them.\r\n\r\nMy Man Godfrey is in the sub genre of screwball comedy, and it may actually be true that they don\u2019t make them like this any longer, because it seems like most of the wacky comedies nowadays center around bodily functions or shocking \r\nlanguage (though I guess you can argue it isn\u2019t shocking anymore.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, this movie had plenty of laughs, a nice story, and a romance thrown in. The two leads dominate, of course, but the whole Bullock family is well cast. The only aspect that detracted from my enjoyment at all was the Carlo character. The silly matriarch of the family is  sponsoring him - A musician maybe? And I thought in a few places he was overdone, but it is a minor thing.\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of a social message here, of course, concerning the have and have-not, but it doesn\u2019t weigh down the plot. Great movie."], ["This is essentially three stories that George Stevens has rolled into one, long, family melodrama. It all starts when \"Bick\" (Rock Hudson) travels from his massive Texas ranch to buy an horse from \"Dr. Lynnton\" (Paul Fix). The first thing he sees though is not the beautiful black stallion, but the man's daughter \"Lesley\" (Elizabeth Taylor) riding it. After a sticky start, she is on her way to his home, as his wife, where she must settle into a life where women like her are expected to provide children and live otherwise fairly ornamental lives. Needless to say, she isn't really up for that and the next portion of the film follows her efforts to find a purpose. \"Jett Rink\" (James Dean) is a general factotum on their place. Disliked by \"Bick\" but protected to an extent by his sister \"Luz\" (Mercedes McCambridge). Tragedy strikes and \"Jett\" finds himself the beneficiary of that to the tune of a small plot of land where he quickly discovers oil. That changes the dynamic of the relationships and with the onset of WWII, the traditional lives of all concerned are shaken to the core. The final third, if you like, has probably the strongest message: those who fought together during the war regardless of race or creed are now (largely) back home, victorious, but are expected to fit back into their social demographic - and Stevens uses a swathe of new characters, including their son (Dennis Hopper) and the briefest of appearances from Sal Mineo to illustrate the hypocrisy and double standards that entailed. This third is, in my view, also the weakest section of the story. Perhaps because a degree of ennui was setting in after two hours already, but the flawed characterisation of Dean is a bit too superficial and Miss Taylor - who really does dominate this film - takes too much of a back seat as the familial discord and the effects of the bottle start to dominate the plot. Though Hudson is maybe not the strongest of character actors, here he does provide a degree of accruing decency to his character and at times there is a spark of chemistry between the two leads who, despite themselves, do actually love each other. It's certainly a grand piece of cinema with some spectacular photography. The make-up artistes make a decent stab at facilitating the ageing process as the film progresses and Dimitri Tiomkin manages to adapt his score from the initial Western style genre to a modern modern one creatively. It really does need a big screen and a comfortable seat to get the best out of the performances, but it is definitely worth it."], ["A simply wonderful, sophisticated, adaptation of John Buchan's book of wartime espionage and murder. Robert Donat (\"Hannay\") goes to the theatre to see a man with an incredible memory; but instead becomes embroiled in a tale of cloak-and-dagger antics that see him accused of murder and forced to flee to the highlands of Scotland. It is here that he encounters a sceptical Madeleine Carroll and together they try to get to the bottom of this clever mystery. The dark and eerie Scottish scenery adds to the suspense and there are two good cameos from Peggy Ashcroft and John Laurie too. I found the ending let this down a little - but it is still a gripping hour and half to watch under the expert hand of Alfred Hitchcock."], ["Night of the Living Dead is without a doubt a fantastically innovative film; creating the modern day interpretation of a zombie and forever changing the genre as we know it. There is a lot to like about this film, but unfortunately the limitations of its time hold it back, resulting in a somewhat boring viewing experience. \r\n\r\nFor starters, the story was pretty good. I really enjoyed how the plot focused on a single group of survivors and their thought process as they attempt to deal with the horror and panic of the dead reanimating. There was a tremendous amount of lore delivered via telecommunication broadcasts that I thought added to the movie perfectly. \r\n\r\nThe performances were uneven, some were quite stellar, particularly Duane Jones and Karl Hardman. But Judith O\u2019Dea was quite bad. I\u2019m not sure if it was her performance or the way her character was written but it was just bizarre to see her body language and gestures throughout the film. The beginning chase scene with her was fantastic, with some stellar cinematography. But after that, the way she portrayed shock was laughable. \r\n\r\nThe action in this movie was bad, with punches being all too slow and clunky. I would imagine this movie was quite scary for the time, but with modern day horror constantly elevating, I hardly found myself unnerved. Overall, this movie is Time Capsule for horror and the genre has taken so much from this film throughout the years, but unfortunately it\u2019s legacy far outweighs the entertainment the film brings.\r\n\r\nScore: 54% | \r\nVerdict: Average", "**The film that practically founded the zombie subgenre.**\r\n\r\nAs I've said on other occasions, I'm not a fan at all of films about zombies and similar creatures. It's a type of horror cinema with a strong graphic appeal that doesn't really captivate me. However, I confess that I liked this film. It is much more moderate in its approach to these types of monsters, and effective in building tension and suspense. It's not scary (I believe it was very scary at the time, but these are different times), but it's entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe story told doesn't give us much explanation: we see two brothers who visit a grave in an isolated cemetery and, upon returning to the car, they are chased by what looks like a very disturbed man. It's obviously a zombie, and we know it, but the characters don't know and are extremely confused by what happens next: a growing group of zombies attacks them and forces them to seek shelter in a nearby house, where shortly afterwards they realize that they are not alone and, thanks to radio and television, that the problem is not just there, but it's national.\r\n\r\nGeorge Romero was very intelligent in the way he conceived and wrote the film, which is an entirely independent production and the result of the ingeniously of everyone involved. It is an innovative work, it was one of the first films to bring zombies to the horror universe and the influence of \u201cCarnival of Souls\u201d is very clear in the cinematography, in the way the sound and soundtrack were worked on. The short budget forced the production to be very pragmatic and efficient, to do a lot with little and prioritize credibility and authenticity. I would like to highlight some effective effects such as the flesh eaten by zombies, fake blood and Molotov cocktails. The design of the sets and choice of filming locations is also to be congratulated.\r\n\r\nThe cast has a few points in its favor, but it is essentially amateur and only tries to do what has to be done. Despite being a minor issue and not usually subjected to reflection, it seems significant to me to highlight the choice of a black actor for the main role. Duane Jones, in the film of his life, does a very well done job, with great commitment and that fulfills everything necessary. Karl Hardman is just annoying and the two actresses, Judith O\u2019Dea and Marilyn Eastman, don\u2019t really add anything positive to the film, simply appearing helpless the whole time.", "\"Barbra\" (Judith O'Dea) and her brother are laying some flowers at a cemetery when they espy a man wandering around aimlessly. He suggests it's really a zombie and boy how right he is. She manages to flee to their car but, oh, only if she could have just steered the thing - we might not have had a film! She hits a tree, though, and now dazed and suffering from shock has to take shelter in a nearby house where she gets an hint of what's marauding around outside. Luckily, \"Ben\" (Duane Jones) also finds the house and with a few emerging from the safety of it's cellar, they proceed to fortify the place as best they can and sit it out. It's soon clear from the television and radio reports that this is an epidemic and that those critters are resurrecting themselves and eating their victims. \"Tom\" (Keith Wayne) and girlfriend \"Judy\" (Judith Ridley) decide their best hope is to get the truck parked outside gassed up so they can all escape to the nearest town - but will that work? This film is almost as old as I am, and I am afraid to say it hasn't really aged an whole lot better. Much of the sense of peril comes from the frantic dialogue at the start and the scary elements are now more comical than menacing - especially towards the end. The regular use of the television reportage is useful at first but then seems more designed to pad out this thin story for a ninety minutes that I felt looked more like a TV movie that was just too contrived. It was good to see it on a big screen, but I really don't think I'd bother to watch it again."], ["This really is a story of bitter-sweet love and Emil Jannings and Marlene Dietrich carry it off with consummate skill. He as a set-in-his-ways academic bent on ensuring his pupils are not corrupted by the distracting influences of \"the Blue Angel\" inn; she one of the principle bad influences who wishes exactly the opposite. Essentially this is a love story; but is the love ever reciprocated - could it have been; should it have been? The two stars lead us in a dance that pulls at the heart strings whilst the brain is shouting out completely different instructions. It is compelling, all the more so because it proves to be as much about human dignity as about anything else. Needless to say, when she sings, Dietrich is captivating - and I'm thankful it wasn't me she wanted to get her hooks into!"], [], [], ["Awesome \ud83d\udc4d", "_Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ is a worthy sequel that improves upon the first and expands the lore in a grand way.\r\n\r\nThe quality in this film is vastly superior to the first in terms of CGI and acting, which is par for the course as the main trio grows into their roles and as actors. It is evident that the CGI team had adequate time before this film's release because for 2002 the effects are spectacular. From Dobby the Elf to the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, this movie nails creature models and creates very believable interactions between the models and the actors.\r\n\r\nDespite this film not having the impact in terms of discovering the magical world of Hogwarts for the first time, the story is able to improve upon its predecessor delivering an all-around stronger plot. There is a real sense of mystery surrounding the Chamber of Secrets and the suspense and hysteria it creates around Hogwarts is very intriguing. The stakes and the plot progression feel elevated here, creating a more seamless experience.\r\n\r\nLike previously stated, the main casts acting is improved drastically. Each actor is coming into their own and really is getting comfortable with their character. Rupert Grint steals the show with his comedic timing and cowardly presence. Emma Watson is great again but does not carry the entire trio like she had to in the previous film. There are plenty of new additions this time around and all of them were splendid. I particularly liked Dobby and Gilderoy Lockhart.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets improves upon the first in almost every aspect, and that is all you can ask for a sequel.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _79%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Great_", "This second book in JK Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series sees our trio of wizarding weans start to develop a much closer relationship with each other; and we begin to realise the challenges young \"Harry\" (Daniel Radcliffe) is to face as he grows up.

I could possibly have done without \"Moaning Myrtle\" but the story is well adapted and moves along quickly, with a little more humour than the original too.

I can't vouch, much, for any historical authenticity - it is just a Disney film that celebrates the legend of the man, and his long-time sidekick George Russel (Buddy Ebden) with a catchy theme song and lots of action scenes. It has twinges of a social conscience - using Crockett as a conduit for the principles of fairness, decency and loyalty that underpinned much of he traditions of the \"Founding Fathers\" of the USA back at the start. Parker is a little wooden in the lead, but works well with Ebden to create an enjoyable, at time amusing, action adventure well worth a watch. As ever with films like this, do bear in mind that some of the language and roles are very much of their intended time."], ["A lesser sense of danger and a more family friendly vibe, but that doesn't hinder 1960's <em>'Swiss Family Robinson'</em> as it manages to surpass the original film adaptation of Johann David Wyss' novel.\r\n\r\nThat's mainly thanks to the conclusion, a thing that I criticised the earlier film for. Here, the character motivations are much more consistent and the ending is no longer nonsensical. The finale also has a very watchable event occur, which helps too.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoy the cast here. John Mills is as good as William (aka Father) as Thomas Mitchell is, though Dorothy McGuire fronts a much improved Elizabeth (aka Mother) who is more developed; still not perfect, but certainly better.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, you have three of the Disney resident youngsters teaming up in James MacArthur (Fritz), Tommy Kirk (Ernst) and Kevin Corcoran (Francis). They might not be the greatest actors, yet after seeing them in so many other films (together, in Kirk and Corcoran's case) I can't help but like them. Janet Munro (Roberta) is also decent.\r\n\r\nThe humour is more noteworthy in this one also, I chuckled more times.

Danny Glover is top notch as George, as is a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Roger. You also have Tony Danza (Mel), Neal McDonough (Bass), Adrien Brody (Danny) and Christopher Lloyd (Al) all involved. Not a bad list at all, though I would've loved to have seen more of Lloyd who is very underused - his role, if more prevalent, could've raised the film up massively.\r\n\r\nWith all the silliness of the plot, there is still a nice amount of heart in there - which is entirely predictable, but I appreciated it nevertheless.

Future references to the (1963) present just dates the movie and aren't all that funny, and it tells the audience that just because you have knowledge, doesn't mean you can use it.  Then in the 3rd act, we start a controversy over having knowledge / skills can be used to better or worsen things, and other than inspiring Star Wars, I don't know what the point of it was.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part was when Archimedes got to laugh: he seemed like he really needed it.", "\"Arthur\" - rather unkindly nick-named \"Wart\" is a stable boy with grand ambitions.

We've got suits of armour, dragons, magical dishwashers and, of course, \"Madame Min\" and the characterisations are engaging and mischievous.

While some have argued that Costner was too humorless and brooding for the part, this is a cinematic myth. There are quite a few places in the film where he can be seen smiling and having a good time, like when he makes it back to England after the Crusades or when he's spending time with Marian in Sherwood Forest. Thankfully, he's more three-dimensional than this and so you also see him desperate, angry, grieving, vengeful, strategizing, contemplative, etc.\r\n\r\nTo be honest with you, Costner was in his prime at the time and towers in the role; whether or not you like him is a matter of opinion. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Marian is memorable with her unique facial features and odd hairstyle even though she doesn't trip my trigger. Morgan Freeman as the Moor Azeem is an excellent partner for Robin Hood while Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott are effective villains as the Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisborne respectively. Christian Slater, Nick Brimble and Michael McShane are also on hand as Robin's sometimes merry men, the latter two being Little John and Friar Tuck.\r\n\r\nI've always had mixed feelings about this movie due to its mixed tone and the fact that it loses its mojo in the last 45 minutes. Concerning the first, the flick is often serious and brutal, but it's also sometimes cartoonish and over-the-top. Rickman particularly hams it up, entertaining though he is. Another good example is Geraldine McEwan as the ee-vil witch Mortianna. Her portrayal is spooky and Gothic in a comic book horror kind of way, but it detracts from the many parts that establish the story as believable quasi-history. Still, she's excellent as the hideous witch. Another example is the semi-goofy, overly heroic action scenes, like Robin & Azeem being catapulted over the castle wall. Why sure!\r\n\r\nConcerning the second criticism, the movie is overlong by about 25 minutes. When the Celts attack the camp at the 95-minute mark I always start to lose interest and the rest of the movie is a tedious blur. But there\u2019s a lot of medieval action, if that\u2019s your thang.\r\n\r\nAs far as medieval films of the British Isles go, I prefer the more serious and consistent tone of \"Tristan + Isolde\" (2006) and \"First Knight\" (1995). Nevertheless, \u201cPrince of Thieves\u201d is an entertaining Robin Hood adventure and is iconic of early 90's cinema. The entire first act is the best part followed by the many Sherwood Forest sequences. And the climatic cameo by a certain famous actor is a nice touch. I enjoy seeing \u201cPrince of Thieves\u201d every five years or so.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 143 minutes and was shot mostly in England, but also France. My wife loves the end credits\u2019 song \u201c(Everything I Do) I Do it for You\u201d by Bryan Adams.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-", "I've always been a fan of the baddie in films - and this film really belongs to Alan Rickman's \"Sheriff\" with a good supporting effort from Geraldine McEwan as his harridan witch cohort. They bring almost all of humour and menace. The bulk of the rest of the film is a pretty run-of-the-mill vehicle for Costner, Freeman and Mastrantonio - and moves along well enough as a pretty formulaic, very freely adapted, costume drama. Brian Blessed hams marvellously in the few scenes he has and the score works well into the fabric of the movie. Sadly, the writing and direction are nothing special. Errol and Basil have little to worry about."], ["***Justifiable execution and justifiable lying***\r\n\r\n\u201cSleepers\u201d (1991) starts out as a coming-of-age film about four boys in 1966-1967 from Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Manhattan, and then morphs into a juvenile prison picture, which covers the first hour. The rest of the movie is a crime tragedy turned courtroom drama, taking place 13 years later in the early 80s. Jason Patric plays the adult version of Shakes, the main protagonist and narrator, while Brad Pitt plays his attorney friend, Michael. When their other two buds, John and Tommy, are taken into custody for murder they hatch a plan to get them off for understandable reasons. Robert De Niro plays their Catholic pastor and father-figure while Dustin Hoffman appears as the dubious defense attorney. Kevin Bacon is on hand as a perverse guard at the boys\u2019 reformatory.\r\n\r\nIn an eye-rolling knee-jerk response, liberal critics have dissed the film as \u201chomophobic\u201d when this isn\u2019t the case at all. For verification, if the victims at the reformatory were girls the baseless criticism wouldn\u2019t even be mentioned. It is not about gender; it is about children and the monstrous abuse of authority for selfish purposes. The film NEVER criticizes what two adults CHOOSE to do behind closed doors.\r\n\r\nIn tone and theme, \u201cSleepers\u201d is similar to the heralded \u201cMystic River\u201d (2003), but more episodic in nature and therefore not as dramatically compelling. Yet it\u2019s a poignant crime drama. Some have panned the movie on the grounds that it justifies revenge murder, but it more clearly supports the idea of just execution when legal authorities have failed and allowed gross corruption to continue.\r\n\r\nAnother moral issue revolves around lying. Is it ever right to lie for the sake of justice? In other words, is lying ever justifiable? Of course it is; at least on rare occasions. For instance, in the bible the midwives lied to Pharaoh in order to save Hebrew infants and are commended for fearing God (Exodus 1:15-21). Rahab also lied to save the two Hebrew spies in Jericho and her actions are hailed in Hebrews 11, the Hall of Faith chapter. During WW2, if Nazi authorities came to your door looking for hidden Jews, would you say \u201cYes, I cannot lie; they are hiding in the attic\u201d? Of course you wouldn\u2019t.      \r\n\r\nThe script by director Barry Levinson was based on a book by Lorenzo Carcaterra, which is supposedly a true story. Although New York authorities have denied its authenticity, they have good reason to do so. Whether or not every jot & tittle is accurate is irrelevant; stories LIKE IT have happened.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 27 minutes and was shot in New York City & surrounding areas (Brooklyn, Manhattan, Yonkers, Hoboken) and Fairfield Hills Hospital, Newtown, Connecticut (Wilkinson School for Boys). ADDITIONAL CAST: Minnie Driver plays the guys\u2019 friend from their youth while Vittorio Gassman is on hand as a nonchalant mob leader in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "\u2018Sleepers\u2019 uses a disturbing and unnecessary narration to tell its controversial revenge story, but the rich characters and great actors easily make up for that.\r\n\r\n8/10"], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["00:00: 21st April, 1980.\r\n\r\nThe Fog is directed by John Carpenter who also co-writes the screenplay with Debra Hill. It stars Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook, Jamie Lee Curtis and Nancy Loomis. Carpenter also scores the music and cinematography is by Dean Cundey.\r\n\r\nThe Californian fishing town of Antonio Bay is preparing to celebrate its 100 year anniversary. As the clock ticks past midnight strange events start to occur around the town, it seems that the town has a secret and that secret is back to make a point...\r\n\r\nNot as praised as Halloween and The Thing from John Carpenter's early horror output, The Fog sees the director tackle the ghost story premise. For many who lapped it up back when the 80s began, it still enthrals and holds in its eerie vice like grip, for others in this desensitised age of gore and cgi overkill, it proves to be a film unable to justify the love poured on it by the fans. Which is a shame.\r\n\r\nBeing able to appreciate the craft of John Carpenter back in 1980 certainly helps to avert some harsh criticisms thrown its way, because Carpenter has achieved, pound for pound, a better ghost story on a fraction of the budget afforded big Hollywood genre productions that have been made since. That's not to say it's perfect, for it's not, Carpenter himself has never been wholly satisfied with the final film, this even after re-shooting a third of the film after originally making a picture reliant on suggestion over presence, but with some smoke machines, a synthesiser, a game cast and a spooky revenge story on the page, he's made a sub-genre classic.\r\n\r\nCarpenter has somehow managed to blend old fashioned ghostly goings on within a modern setting, that of a fishing town that proves perfect once the sun goes down and the town tries to sleep. You can practically smell the salt in the sea, such is the knack of the director for setting the mood. Then with minimalistic panache, the director marries up fog with synth beats to create maximum dread, and then he teases, perfectly, by only letting us glimpse his ghosts as dark figurines, making us fill in the blanks as to what they look like, where armed with our imagination they prove to be more scary than some CGI enhanced entity created in the blockbuster age. The killings that follow carry a high gruesome factor, and we don't need (or get) buckets of blood for them to impact, and the suspense is jacked up so much in the final quarter it proves to be edge of the seat stuff as the spring finally uncoils.\r\n\r\nFilmed in widescreen to give off a higher end production value, which works, Carpenter surrounds himself with familiar folk and inserts in jokes and homages that also keep the film grounded and a mile away from Hollywood excess. From character names to Hitchcock stars and references (Bodega Bay anyone?), the pic feels exactly what it is, a film made with love; Carpenter even cameos at the start of the film and it is a world away from the smugness of a Shyamalan. Yes there are problems, Curtis and Atkins are strangers who meet and in the blink of an eye they are in bed together, which looks to be a bad edit, while the gathering of principal characters in one place for the finale is a bit of a contrivance. Yet these are minor irritants, because The Fog is a film that once loved will always stay loved. In 78 Carpenter plotted the course for the slasher formula to follow, in 1980 he helped realign (see also Peter Medak's The Changeling) the good ship ghost story that was on rocky waters. Low budget creepy excellence. 9/10", "A century after a ship sank losing all hands, an eery fog makes it's way along the coast towards the small town of Antonio Bay in California. The residents think nothing of this until a series of para-normal incidents start to occur and folks start to disappear. Could the mysterious fog have anything to do with these mishaps? A bit of investigation into the history of the town discovers that it was founded after an heinous crime committed by their predecessors on a passing ship, wrecked deliberately, that was carrying lepers - and gold. Could the fog be part of the retribution? Well it's soon down to Jamie Lee Curtis (\"Solley\"); Adrianne Barbeau (\"Stevie\") and Janet Leigh (\"Kathy\") to try to get to the bottom of things before the looming mist deposits it's own menacing cargo. The instantly recognisable opening tones from John Houseman's \"Dr. Machen\" set the scene well here for what is a gently accumulating horror film that leaves much of the sense of peril to our own nervousness, imagination and also offers the largely female cast an opportunity not just to run about screaming and wailing in the face of danger for a change. Darkness, fogginess, eeriness - lights flickering, cars not starting - the sense of isolation and loneliness. All of these fears are well capitalised upon by John Carpenter - not just with his use of the lighting and the camera, but also with his creation of a score that is also effective at heightening the tension. The acting is really only adequate, it has to be said - with Adrienne Barbeau struggling a bit, I felt - but unlike with many other Carpenter films, he stays focussed on the simplicity of the peril - the characters are given enough to say and do and the pace doesn't hang about for just shy of ninety minutes. It's not a jump moment movie, the effects are gradual and I found them to be pretty effective too."], ["\"Too little of too much\" would describe this movie well, which presented us a dystopian New York with development potential and characters whose background is shared, exposed with brief moments of characterization that made me feel like I was missing this movie's predecessor. It didn't exist, and so the end result was of an expanded universe of unknown circumstances - except for the brief introduction we got in the opening credits - where the events barely told the story during the time it was running. But where this movie failed in terms of script, it almost made up with atmosphere and music. It sounds great throughout, but the credit goes to the opening theme that is as minimal as the presentation is grounded, in that humble approach of whom ambition wasn't unheard. Sadly, it's not the case of a classic whose production values challenge the computer generated visuals of today (and ironically this movie's novelty was the wireframe view), but if you're interested in history and want to make a contextual analysis, you may find something worth treasuring.\r\n__________________\r\nWhen authors create they sign. When editors hack they design.", "A Snake, a Brain, a Cabbie, a Duke and the President Of The USA.\r\n\r\nIt's 1997 and Manhattan Island is a walled off prison, during the flight of Air Force One the president's plane is taken over by a terrorist and the president ejects out in the safety pod. Sadly for him he lands right in the middle of Manhattan Island. When an armed unit lands inside the walls they are told that the president has been taken hostage and they must get out of their prison ASAP. At a loss what to do, the authorities decide to send one man in alone, ex war hero turned criminal, Snake Plissken, not only does he have to contend with surviving the incredibly hostile prison, he also has a time bomb implanted in his body that, should he not get the president out safely within 24 hours, will explode and mean no more Snake Plissken!\r\n\r\nMade in 1981 and set in 1997, it's safe to say John Carpenter is not the best predictor of the future around. However, his vision of a future where America has thrown all its criminals on one island, where they create their own society out of harms way, has to rank as an incredibly adroit piece of work. This place is grim and deadly, the flotsam and jetsam of society thrust together in this bleak and desolate place of class separation. What Carpenter has achieved with his usual minimal budget allowance is a smouldering sci-fi classic that may be as daft as they come, but it pulses with cool and cheekily slaps you around the face with its cheeky satirical edginess. Kudos is given to the great production design from Joe Alves, who along with Carpenter has crafted this brilliantly dirty netherworld of crime.\r\n\r\nOur anti-hero of the piece, Snake Plissken, is superbly played by Kurt Russell, the original choice interestingly was Tommy Lee Jones, but Russell fuels Plissken's mantra to make him one of the eighties coolest grumpy bastards, and his work here is first class in terms of the films' apocalyptic structure. Surroundning Russell is a wealth of quality performers each adding their personal bits to this tick-tock stew, Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasance, Harry Dean Stanton, Adrienne Barbeau and Isaac Hayes all earn their money and flesh out the story to the end.\r\n\r\nCalling Escape From New York an action picture would be setting first time viewers up for a real let down, what action there is is minimal but highly effective, the machismo flourishes acting more as a point of reference to the picture's time bomb urgency. I like to think of the film as being more a sci-fi adventure yarn laced with darkly comic humour, with of course machismo thrown in as a side salad to accentuate the bleakness of it all. A wonderful concoction indeed. 9/10", "Nails the \"post-apocalyptic except the world didn't end\" vibe.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal.

She begins a journey of discovery - about herself as much as anything. \"Howl\" - the ultimate free spirit is also facing down demons of his own that he is struggling to reconcile with. \"Calcifer\" provides the conduit for them to get to better understand each other and also much of the humour as they seek to break the spells that bind them.

He deliberately let himself fall on a stair to injure himself and stop his growth. Oskar's refusal to grow and release his tin drum is an obvious metaphor about refusing the Nazi regime. This is made more obvious since he finally decided to grow and let go of his drum after the Nazi's defeat.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Drum is based on a celebrated novel by German author Gunter Grass. Director Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff brings it to life with profound elegance and intellectual humor. Made in 1979, in the middle of the German film renaissance, The Tin Drum pokes fun at the Nazi regime and at the same time presents an unforgettable and often hilarious story.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins in the late 19th century when Oskar's grandmother helps his grandfather to escape German soldiers by letting him hide under her skirt. It is also where Oskar's mother Agnes (Angela Winkler) is conceived. Agnes grows up during the First World War and marries a man named Alfred Matzerath (Mario Adorf). She begins to have an affair with her cousin Jan Bronski, while Oskar slowly becomes aware of their relationship.\r\n\r\nDavid Bennent's performance as Oskar is simply amazing. He was about 12 years old at the time, and he plays Oskar from childhood to his 20s. Although Oskar's physical appearance never changes. We can see his aging process through Bennent's performance. Oskar's movement changes; he begins to become more mature and discover the world around him. Bennent plays the character with an impressive level of believability and intellectual maturity.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Drum reminded me of one of my favorite movies-Forrest Gump. Both movies have central characters that are physically and mentally disabled, and both manage to have an interesting journey life. Both movies pass through an important historical event, with both heroes getting involved. The Tin Drum is not quite in the same league as Forrest Gump, but it still amazed and captivated me from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Drum contains some really grotesque scenes. One scene in particular is when they show a fisherman using a dead horse's head as bait for eels. The fisherman removes the eels one by one from the horse's head, while Agnes vomits in disgust. To balance it out, the movie also contains moments of pure joy. I love the sequence where Oskar's drumming influences a band to change their music form a German march to Strauss' The Blue Danube. A Nazi officer screams in disgust, while the crowd joins together and dances.\r\n\r\nI enjoy watching intelligent satires. I laughed out loud a lot of times in this movie and I relished its lush story. The movie deals with many things, including warfare, adultery, and religion. It may be a little too long for some people at 140 minutes, but for me, no good movie is too long. The Tin Drum contains astonishing images powered by remarkable acting."], ["Having previously watched Greenaway's 'Prospero's Books', basically from the same era, one definitely gets a sense of the auteur, of great visualizing prowess in the Welsh native. I adore watching Helen Mirren from ANY era, but particularly here, in between the young adulthood beauty she displayed in Michael Powell's 'Age of Consent', through the remarkably absurd and audacious 'Caligula', straight to the sophisticated and very dangerous gorgeousness displayed in 'The Comfort of Strangers'.\r\n\r\nIt's great to see any dude who's mean to a beautiful woman get their comeuppance (particularly the wealthy--it offers a sort of 'wish fulfillment' for the 99% of us), and the climax here is one of cinema's most articulate presentation of that phenomenon. It definitely made me wish to see the rest of both Greenaway's movies and of Mirren's performances. Well worth the acquired taste necessary for this sort of delicacy."], ["Madness and Patsies Crash Together In Kubrick's Explosive Thunderbolt.\r\n\r\nStanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory is holding up rather well these days, in fact it's as pertinent and relevant as ever.\r\n\r\nIt's 1916 and the French and German armies are in opposing mud trenches, when the French are ordered to undertake a suicidal assault on a German held hill, many of the soldiers are quick to realise it's an impossible order to see through to its conclusion and retreat, something which brings charges of cowardice from the military hierarchy. Someone must take the fall... \r\n\r\nWithdrawn from circulation in France at one time, unreleased in Spain as well, Paths of Glory is a shattering indictment on military hierarchy. On those General types who watch from afar through telescopic sights as men and boys are led like lambs to the slaughter, then off they go to their dinning rooms to gorge on wine and wholesome meat, the stench of rotting flesh as bad on their breaths as it is out there in no man's land. But it's OK for the war effort, while there might even be a promotion for some lucky soul in nice trousers...\r\n\r\nA two-parter, the film was adapted from the novel written by Humphrey Cobb. The first half follows the craziness of the attack, the horrors of war brutally realised as Kubrick and cinematographer Georg Krause bring out the worry and simmering anger that jostle for the soldier's souls. The camera is cold and calculating, thus perfect for the material to hand, it leads the viewers - with skillful fluidity - through the bleakness of the trenches and the desolation of no man's land, the former a foreboding place, the latter an atrocity exhibition as bodies get flayed and shattered, while others retreat with limbs or sanity barely intact.\r\n\r\nSecond part shifts to a legally based procedural as the Generals conspire to make an example of those who retreated. Cowardice and a dereliction of duty apparently means the firing squad must save the integrity of the army. Patsies are lined up, but their Colonel (a superb Kirk Douglas) wants to defend them, there's much sweat, tears and anger, accusations hurled, and mistakes once again proving insurmountable. Which leads to the astonishing finale, heartbreaking whilst inducing fury, and crowned by an elegiac song that brings tears for characters and viewers alike.\r\n\r\nA monochrome masterpiece full of technical skills, towering performances and writing to die for, Paths of Glory, candidate for one of the greatest anti-military films ever crafted. 10/10", "\"Col. Dax\" (Kirk Dougas) is cajoled by \"Gen. Broulard\" (Adolphe Menjou) into taking his Great War weary regiment on one last mission in occupied France. Frankly, it's little better than a suicide one, but his operational commander \"Gen. Mireau\" (George Macready) is determined at all costs that they succeed. Let battle commence! Only the French soldiers quickly realise that they are facing a well armed, immovable, German opponent and are either killed or driven back. Desperate to motivate his men, \"Mireau\" gives an order that is luckily not acted upon and with the mission deemed a failure and many of the men now in the relative safety of their trenches, the general orders a court martial for cowardice of three of the survivors. \"Dax\" is appalled but a trial there must be... Are the right people being tried and is the outcome a mere formality? I saw a 16mm print of this rather gripping and depressing wartime drama and it augmented the genuine sense of peril faced by these men as incoming artillery, the claustrophobic trench existences and - make no mistake - the competencies of their officers are put on display for us. It's dark, wet, gritty and as we reach the denouement clearly illustrative of the futility of much of this stage of this war. Kirk Douglas takes top billing and is adequate, it's Macready who actually steals this for me and the director's wife does the briefest of scenes as a German cabaret singer, too. Again, I think cinema will focus this better than television, but either way it's a thought-provoking expos\u00e9 of war that holds up well 60-odd years later.", "**A short and objective film, with a clear and still relevant message, as well as a huge performance by Kirk Douglas.**\r\n\r\nThere are several films about World War I, but it is far from being seen by the public as one of the best. In fact, it seems to me a little forgotten today. It is, however, timely and current in its pacifist message in which the greatest absurdity of war is emphasized in a partially true story, in which a group of three French soldiers is shot by cowardice after joining an inglorious attack to a much stronger and prepared German position.\r\n\r\nStanley Kubrick is a director to which no one gets indifferent: either if he loves or hates. He seems to have enjoyed fostering this by choosing hard themes, uncomfortable and debatable movies. This is just one more, and I, who loved some of his movies just as I hated others, decided to put this movie in the middle of the table. It is much more direct and easy to understand than most of his later work, but is nonetheless uncomfortable for the questions raised. For example, the contrasts between the ordinary soldier, mud in a trench and subject to die like an animal, and the generals, kilometers in the rear, in beautiful palaces where there is not a single shot. Intelligently, Kubrick focuses on the obvious injustice of punishment as proof of the inhuman absurdity of war and military leaders.\r\n\r\nThus, the movie is simple, direct, short (not even one and a half hours) and abrasive. Black-and-white cinematography is very clear, luminous and works a lot of light and shadow. The edition is effective and the soundtrack almost imperceptible for discretion. The sets and costumes are worthy of a large production. However, there are no action and combat scenes do not focus on the intensity of the fight, but its most human side. It is another perspective of war: those looking for action will not have what they want, but who wants a deeper movie has a full plate here.\r\n\r\nKirk Douglas is the protagonist, embodying a colonel who is responsible for carrying out the defense of the military under trial. The efforts he desperately leads to the last instances are notable, but as the sentence was predetermined, the court is a sordid masquerade. Douglas begins to be cordial and contained, an officer at the orders, part of the gear, but gradually changes as his character is confronted with all that brutality, and this is really a meritorious effort for any actor. I don't know his work well yet, but I wouldn't surprise me if this was one of Douglas's best movies. Unfortunately, and without disregard for Adolphe Menjou and Joe Turkel's efforts, the rest of the cast does not accompany him at all."], ["My son is going to be all right.

One man was arrested and sentenced to death for the crime, based on the testimony of a sixteen year old acquaintance. These basic facts are covered in one of the most brilliant films to come out of the 1980's. Randall Adams was no drifter. He was moving from Ohio and was staying in Dallas with his brother. He found a good job, and planned on living there a while. Then he met David Harris, a punk from a Klan-infested small town in southern Texas. The officer is murdered, and Harris blames Adams, even though Harris gloated about shooting the young cop to his friends. Adams was railroaded into prison while Harris embarked on a petty crime spree. He continued his misdemeanor ways until he actually killed a man during a botched kidnapping. Now Harris was in jail, and Adams was still appealing his conviction. Witnesses came forward claiming to have seen Adams shoot Wood, yet none of them have a gleam of credibility. Finally, Adams gets some decent lawyers, who begin working to get him out. He is granted an appeal by the U.S. Supreme Court, but as of the making of the film, he was still serving life in prison. A little research shows what happened to Randall Adams.\r\n\r\nErrol Morris goes where few documentary makers go. He films convincing reenactments of the crime. These are not \"Unsolved Mysteries\"-type reenactments, Morris has a real director's eye, and gives the audience every detail needed- from a tossed milkshake to the number of people spotted in the killer's car. Philip Glass adds a haunting musical score that gets under your skin and hypnotizes you. The convict Adams is a sincere man, and the film makers are obviously rooting for his cause. Harris is an ignorant punk, enjoying playing games with people's lives. If the Dallas County prosecutors had done their job, Harris would not have committed his second murder: food for thought. Harris' final interview, done on audio cassette, is chilling, and will make a believer of anyone who otherwise thought \"this could never happen to me.\" The three \"witnesses\" to the slaying are a joke, two in it for the reward, and a salesman who boasts of his photographic memory but cannot recall if Wood's patrol car was in front of or behind Harris' stolen vehicle. \"The Thin Blue Line\" is more than talking heads, this is a searing story that puts to shame any fiction that tries to cover the same ground.

I am sure there was a lot of senseless violence then, just as there is now. And Bronson seemed like an odd choice as hero to me, though who can question a director who had the instinct to make perennial good guy Henry Fonda the ultimate villain?

Why waste actors like Fonda, Robards, Bronson, Elam, and Strode on this stupid screenplay?", "**One of the great western movies.**\r\n\r\nWestern movies made in co-production by Italians and Americans (called \"spaghetti-western\") have been considered among the best that emerged within their genre, cleverly combining the tough action of Wild West gunslingers with the taste for raw realism and detail of the Italian filmmakers. I believe that such a thing may displease North Americans, who consider the cowboy a figure that is \"true USA\". I therefore invite them to visit the Brazilian city of Barretos, or the rural areas of Goi\u00e1s, Mato Grosso or Tocantins in Brazil. There are plenty of cowboys there\u2026 they just lack the guns.\r\n\r\nSergio Leone is an unavoidable figure here, having been responsible for the greatest \u201cspaghetti\u201d ever made. In this film, he gives us again a remarkable job, full of qualities. I don't consider it the best of his career or the best \"spaghetti western\" ever made, but it definitely has a place on the podium. The film begins very well, with the massacre of an Irish immigrant and his family, which leaves in the hands of a second wife \u2013 yes, the man was secretly a bigamist \u2013 a few acres of uninteresting desert... but there are people willing to kill for it. It happens that the smart Irishman had bought the only viable land for the railroad, and had even acquired the right to build a station and a new settlement! In the middle, we still have a gunslinger in search of personal revenge and another, in the pay of the railroad itself.\r\n\r\nLet's face things frankly: the movie is good. It's a classic in its own right, almost mandatory for any movie lover, which doesn't mean that it's mandatory to like it! It is not a perfect film, it has problems that we will talk about, but it is equally endowed with characteristics and qualities that deserve to be valued.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is very elegant, with good light and color. The sets and costumes are beautiful, even if it is frankly difficult to set a date to the film. In addition to the fact that the script does not establish a rigorous chronology, it's clear that the concern of the production designer and costume designers was aesthetics rather than historical rigor because there is a mixture of props, clothing and objects from the 1870s, 1880s and 1860. Is it a minor problem? Yes, but it is still a problem and a sign of the carelessness with which many productions are still facing historical rigor nowadays. The visual and special effects are put to good use and the soundtrack, atmospheric and truly impactful, is one of Ennio Morricone's most powerful works. Unfortunately, the film's editing was not the best, with cuts so abrupt and violent that it almost leads one to believe that the film was cut \"a posteriori\" for some reason. And perhaps the biggest problem turns out to be its excessively slow and annoying construction, with each scene lasting three minutes longer than necessary and the general length reaching three hours unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nWe can only say good things about the cast: among a vast succession of unknown and unimportant Italians, there are some outstanding actors who do not disappoint us and give us magnificent interpretations. Charles Bronson is a good-hearted tough guy with a monstrous charisma that steals our attention whenever he appears. Henry Fonda is effective as a villain, showing the actor's enormous versatility. Claudia Cardinale, one of the muses of cinema at the time, combines an impressive resilience of spirit, a high dose of charisma and a beauty that is still remembered today. Jason Robards has the difficult task of being the helpful good guy who ends badly to glorify the hero, but he takes the opportunity to show all his value as an actor.", "Great western that I never watched despite owning the old DVD, but with Paramount releasing this on 4K UHD, decided to sit down through the 165-minute duration and it was a wonderful experience. Great performances all around, but most notably Jason Robards and Charles Bronson. Just another homerun from Sergio Leone though I think I prefer \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" but it's close. **4.5/5**"], [], ["**One of those films that was very successful but is currently struggling to capture new audiences.**\r\n\r\nWe are used to seeing John Wayne associated with Western films, yet here is the actor making a small and modest romantic film about a retired boxer with great physical presence who, after returning to the land where he was born, falls in love with a redhead with a strong personality, leading to serious disagreements with her brother, who is not happy with their dating.\r\n\r\nIt is one of those films that was a commercial and critical success in the time it was released and even collected awards, such as the Oscars for Best Cinematography in Color and Best Director. It's a remarkable achievement, and it's strange that better and more memorable films never achieved any of this and had to wait years (sometimes decades) to find an audience that knew how to appreciate them. Some things, I suppose, that even a movie guru cannot fully explain!\r\n\r\nCurrently, it is one of those films that is a bit lost, and which is in serious danger of becoming one of those films that only appears in collections or on TV channels of old films. Why? First, for its lack of definition: it is not a drama, but neither is it funny enough to consider it an effective and interesting comedy. Humor is based on the love-hate relationship of the main characters, and that's not enough.\r\n\r\nAnother problem with the film is the actors. We have a cast of heavy hitters, yet none of them are particularly good, and the film remains a minor piece of work in their career. John Wayne is a safe bet because, despite any antipathy or sometimes not looking as manly as would be desirable, he is full of charisma and talent. Here, he is playing with Maureen O'Hara, who does some talented work and has good dialogues. Victor McLaglen doesn't disappoint either, while the other actors just wander around the scene doing different things.\r\n\r\nFor me, the biggest problem with the film is the amount of stereotypes about Ireland, portrayed essentially as a rural place, very green, very backward, with somewhat primitive customs and where people are almost all redheads and alcoholics. I don't know what Irish people think about this, but I would be a little uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I think it's fair to highlight, on the positive side, the vibrant beauty of the colors and scenery and rural landscapes, which are very idyllic. The film really is eye candy. What spoils the experience? It's a really long film for the plot it brings with it, and the action drags on, sometimes painfully."], ["Stereotypical Sergio Leone film with endless waitings and sight crossings.\r\n\r\nOne of the performances that made Robert de Niro de actor he is and an interesting way of telling a story and the evolution of America during the years of the alcohol prohibition.", "**It's an excellent film, which proves the importance of good post-production, and how bad editing can ruin the whole thing.**\r\n\r\nThere are certain films that impress us so much when we see them that we are really surprised when we discover how ignored they were by the great awards. This film is one of them: I was really shocked to find that it wasn't even nominated for an Oscar or a Golden Globe\u2026 and I had to read a bit to understand why that happened.\r\n\r\nThe film is perhaps one of the best in S\u00e9rgio Leone's extensive filmography, and is often compared to other great gangster films such as \"Godfather\". I, personally, wouldn't dare to do that, but I could still put this film in the \u201ctop ten\u201d of the great mobster films. Amazingly, it was a huge box office failure in the US because they insisted on releasing there an extremely cut version, with about two and a half hours. A version so forgettable and badly edited that no one understood the story and that the film had no chance of running for the highest awards in the industry! It was a shot in the foot and proves the importance of a good edition for the quality of the product. Sometimes a longer film is preferable to a sterile, abridged version.\r\n\r\nThe script is wonderful and follows the criminal path of a small group of youngsters from a Jewish community in New York, stretching from the 20s to the 60s. The story revolves around Noodles, but the main character ends up being Max, who becomes the gang's boss. The relationship between them is very well explored. However, not everything went well: there is a love sub-plot between Noodles and Deborah that is never taken further, there are several characters that seem too sketchy and underdeveloped and there are situations that the film doesn't know how to explore as it should (the most glaring being the violent death of the youngest gang member). I just can't say how many of these problems started in the editing room, with radical cuts in the story told.\r\n\r\nRobert DeNiro was one of the first names to be hired for the cast, and had a say in the choice of several other actors. DeNiro is impeccable, and he provides us with excellent quality work. Moreover, I think that this helped to glue the actor's image a little to the criminal films in the popular imagination, along with \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cGoodfellas\u201d. James Woods is also amazing in the role he has been given and leaves with this film his greatest film work. Elizabeth McGovern also does very well here, although I feel that the actress was not able to make her career take off afterward (I only saw her really successful now, with \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d). I also liked the brief, but remarkable, participation of Jennifer Connelly, still very young. And I feel sorry for Joe Pesci, because the actor is wasted by appearing only in a couple of scenes (perhaps another victim of the radical cuts in the editing room).\r\n\r\nLeone uses everything he knows in this film and provides us with incredible, beautiful cinematography, which knows how to take advantage of slow camera movements, close-ups in the most striking scenes and intense colors. The flashbacks are quite well-marked, and anyone familiar with the cinematic resource will have no difficulty in following the temporal advances and retreats that take place. The special effects do their job well, the costumes are excellent, and the characterization has its moments (DeNiro has been masterfully aged, and very much resembles what he is today). As a film where crime and violence are things we expect to find, we have an array of violent scenes and graphic situations that include not only brutal murders, beatings and shootings but also teen sex, voyeurism and, most notably, a long and particularly graphic rape scene. It's not a movie for the faint-hearted. A final word for the soundtrack, by Ennio Morricone. It is highly regarded by connoisseurs and I admit it works, but I'm not a fan of the pan pipe. I feel it gives the film an oriental touch, it would be something I would expect more from a martial arts film soundtrack.", "Told by way of a really potent (and well scored by Morricone) retrospective, this sits us down and takes us through a forty year period in the life of the now down-at-heel \"Noodles\" (Robert De Niro) and of the development of the city of New York. The contents of an old briefcase serve as an aide memoire as the retrospective illustrates just how he and three of his childhood friends decided that the gutter was not for them, and that using the \"system\" to get on was the only way. Prohibition, violence, crime, brutality were the currency back then and \"Noodles\" learned not to have scruples about such things. Love, romance feature too - choices, compromises and tragedy all feature as Sergio Leone and De Niro immerses us in the characterful and emotionally charged chronology. The film looks great, the attention to detail is superb, and a really strong supporting cast help offer us s sense that we are actually there for much of the time. Living and breathing the squalor, the danger, the opportunity and perhaps, the inevitability, of the paths these kids took in a the 1930s. It is very long, but that's effective rather than dull. It allows the characters to develop, to breathe and then to disappear - only, perhaps, to reappear in a different guise later on. Ageing is also a factor here too - just as they rose, others rise too with differing standards and ethics - their sense of loyalty and integrity not quite marrying up! No Oscar nominations which is really rather odd - this is easily one of the best, most authentic-looking, depictions of the rise of NYC that cinema has ever delivered. Director's cut on a big screen if you can - it helps focus the attention, shows the cinematography to best effect and helps appreciate just how vast Leone's vision was."], ["Interesting and iconic movie about faith and the meaning of life. A must seen.", "**The universality and invincibility of Death, the fear of dying, the importance of faith and its use by the Church in a timeless film, but not suitable for everyone.**\r\n\r\nThe film, set in the late Middle Ages, begins with a knight returning to his homeland in Sweden after participating in the crusades. When he spots the figure of Death, who has come to get him, he decides to try to gain time by inviting her to play chess: if he wins the game, Death will not take him.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a huge film essay around the themes of death, beliefs, faith, religion and the role of spirituality in human experience. While the plague is raging and claiming victims, we see people increasingly scared, and blindly resorting to faith to protect themselves from what looks like the end of times. We see people's daily lives, with their mistakes, virtues, sins and difficulties. We see the knight himself, with a growing fear of dying and struggling with deeper and deeper doubts about faith, the existence of God. Furthermore, we also see how the Church exploited the fear of death to reinforce its power, influence and relevance within uneducated communities shaken by the epidemic. The ending is simple, but there is a deep meaning in it.\r\n\r\nSwedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece seems to have its origins in his own fear of death. Max von Sydow, who gave life to the knight, is the greatest actor present in the film and gives us a strong and impactful performance. The film has gained notoriety over the decades and has become one of the most timeless and culturally significant classics of European cinema. However, it is not a film for everyone. Its simplicity, the way it approaches very complicated and philosophical themes and the ending that is difficult to understand at first glance are more than enough reasons why many people do not like this film, and I have to admit that there is a reason. For me personally, it wasn't a success, it's not a movie you want to see regularly, but I recognize its value."], ["And there wouldn't be nothing but rebs dyin if they'd let the fifty-fourth in it.\r\n\r\nBased around the actual letters sent by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw to his parents, this Civil War picture tells the story of the Massachusetts 54th Regiment, the first black regiment to fight under the American flag. Led by their white leader (Shaw), they must overcome bigotry, in fighting and the war itself, and this just to feel like men of honour.\r\n\r\nThe most striking thing about Glory is that it is never over sentimental. With the subject to hand it would have been easy for the makers to over egg the pudding and rely solely on a racialist stance purely for impact. What we do get is actually a candidate for one of the most politically correct war films to have ever been made. It's harsh and at times heart tugging, that in fact is certainly true, but the narrative never veers from the core essence of men wanting to be just that - men!\r\n\r\nDirector Edward Zwick has many critics in the industry, but here his attention to detail should be roundly applauded. He perfectly captures the period whilst molding a tightly plotted piece of work. Zwick also needs a pat on the back for hiring cinematographer Freddie Francis (Academy Award Winner), who weaves his magic to bring the brutality of the surroundings vividly to life. While James Horner provides a wonderful swirling emotive score (fans of his work on Braveheart should definitely check out this earlier composition). Though the film is essentially a multi ensemble piece, there are tremendous performances from the principal actors.  Matthew Broderick (Shaw), Denzel Washington (Academy Award Winner Best Supporting Actor) (Trip), Morgan Freeman (John Rawlins) and Andre Braugher (Searles).\r\n\r\nWe follow this regiment from their initial formation, here they are ill equipped and never taken seriously, it appears that this group of men are not even worthy of being canon fodder. But through sheer determination - and led by the empathetically driven Shaw, the 54th Regiment prove themselves to be a worthy fighting force. This ultimately leads to their place in American history with the culmination of events at South Carolina's Fort Wagner (a stunning emotive finale that booms out of the screen). \r\n\r\nHeroic and tragic is the tale of Glory, but the chief point of enlightenment through historical facts, and the message of heroics having no colour, makes Glory a truly inspiring movie that demands to be seen and totally respected. 10/10", "**An excellent film that deserves to be revisited and brought back from oblivion.**\r\n\r\nFor me, as a historian, this film couldn't be more interesting. It's not your average war movie, with soldiers running and shooting, and heroism spilling over from bloody deaths. It is much sharper and deeper because it talks about a topic that is treated with excessive ease when talking about the American Civil War: racism. And it's a shame that it's another relatively forgotten film these days.\r\n\r\nReally, if we think about it and are faithful to the mentality of the time, it cannot be said that the Civil War was a war against racism, because it was everywhere and in the Northern states, which were mostly against slavery, there was a strong racism that revealed itself in other ways. If in the South African-Americans were only good for slave labor, in the North they had to stay between the factory and the unhealthy suburbs. The difference was quite subtle. What existed in the North was a firmer awareness that slavery was something that should not continue to exist, a vision of things that the South did not accept because it did not suit them, they were heavily agricultural states and their wealth depended on the export of cotton.\r\n\r\nThe film tackles the subject by showing us how a black regiment was virtually segregated within the unionist army, and the pressure maneuvers its commander had to do to get his men to go fight with the other soldiers. Robert Shaw's gestures were decisive in convincing the Union to really believe in the ability of black soldiers and to recruit more people, giving the Union an additional asset that helped win the war.\r\n\r\nDirected by Edward Zwick, it is an excellent film that respects and honors the past. Even so, there are certain flaws in the historical reconstruction: there are some characters who were younger than in the film, there is an amputation that is much more cruel than it would have been in real life (anesthetics were already being used), it is not correct to say that the 54th of Massachusetts was the first regiment of blacks (there were two already formed, by Kansas) and it is also incorrect to show some of these blacks as former slaves, since this regiment was entirely formed by blacks born in freedom. Even if he makes these and other mistakes, we have to recognize that the production made a great effort to recreate the past with a certain level of accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe film won three Oscars, in the categories of Best Cinematography, Best Supporting Actor and Best Sound. I think they were fair rewards. The cinematography couldn't be better, and makes wonderful use of the impressive work in terms of the sets, the choice of filming locations, the selection of props, the design of costumes. The editing is also very good, and the soundtrack, while not remarkable, has a certain epic sense and does an impeccable accompaniment to what appears on the screen. And if Denzel Washington deserved, for his effort and commitment, the golden statuette, many others could consider themselves worthy winners because the cast of this film is full of artists and professionals of caliber. Morgan Freeman, then living a particularly happy moment in his career, gives us a powerful job and Matthew Broderick does, in this film, the best work of his career to date."], ["**Rosencrantz and Guildenstern must remain in the theater.**\r\n\r\nThis film is perhaps the proof that not all successful plays are good enough to work in the cinema. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two characters from \u201cHamlet\u201d, by William Shakespeare, but it is difficult for anyone to remember them without being very knowledgeable about the literary work in question. They really barely matter to the action. Here, they are the main actors, and we are invited, in a way, to see things through their eyes. In theater, this is interesting. In the cinema, and for a general audience that doesn't know \u201cHamlet\u201d so well, this doesn't seem like a good idea.\r\n\r\nGary Oldman and Tim Roth brought the main roles to life with great panache and value, and the film ends up not being an absolute waste of time thanks to these two magnificent and valuable actors, full of talent. There is a high dose of \u201cnonsense\u201d in the dialogues between the two, and this can become tiring, but it generally works without surprising. The rest of the cast does not have such good material and opportunities to stand out, thus leaving the film somewhat devoid of good characters other than the protagonists.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the emphasis is on the costumes and sets. I can't say that there is great historical rigor here: historically, Hamlet's life is located in Denmark in the Year One Thousand and what we see is Renaissance, much more suited to people and figures who would be contemporary with Shakespeare. But I didn't have any problems with that, and that's not even a problem because all of this is fiction and can be situated in time whenever you want. Much more difficult to bear is the slight feeling that we are watching a kind of recorded play instead of a film."], ["Welles/Heston B&W cult noir is great on a technical level, but meh as a viewing experience\r\n\t\r\nOn the Texas border a Mexican detective (Charlton Heston) assists an American investigation into a shocking murder of an American official on the border, but he soon learns that the imposing & slovenly Sheriff (Orson Welles) is shady with a penchant for framing. Janet Leigh is on hand as the detective\u2019s new bride, an American.\r\n\r\n\u201cTouch of Evil\u201d (1958) was written/directed by Welles (loosely based on a book) and has a huge reputation as a B&W noir-ish cult flick. There ARE interesting technical things going on as far as camera angles, lighting and impressive long takes (e.g. the opening sequence). It also has a notable classic cast with Leigh thoroughly stunning, not to mention Joanna Moore, Marlene Dietrich, Joi Lansing and a cameo by Zsa Zsa Gabor on the female front.\r\n\r\nYet I otherwise found the picture talky, nigh surreal and noticeably hokey with an unengrossing story and dubious acting, e.g. the hooligan Mexicans and the eye-rolling Shakespearean lunatic \u201cnight man\u201d (Dennis Weaver). Seriously, viewing this film is like entering Welles\u2019 head on an acid trip.\r\n\r\nThat said, the film offers quite a bit to digest and I could see it playing better on additional viewings, which explains its cult status, but I\u2019m not interested. There are far more fascinating and compelling B&W dramas with noteworthy casts from that general era, like \u201cThe Misfits\u201d (1963).\r\n\r\nI viewed the long reconstructed version, aka the \u201cdirector\u2019s cut,\u201d which runs about 110 minutes while the original studio-butchered version runs 93 minutes. Interestingly, the film wasn\u2019t shot anywhere near the border, let alone the Texas border, but in freakin\u2019 Venice, Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C", "We start with a man putting a bomb in a car on the Mexican side of the border. When it explodes on the American side flattening the occupants, the local \"Capt. Quinlan\" (Orson Welles) decides to make a bit of a cursory investigation - in cahoots with his opposite number \"Vargas\" (Charlton Heston). Whilst they are out doing their sleuthing, \"Susan Vargas\" (Janet Leigh) is lured to a meeting with \"Uncle Joe\" (Akim Tamiroff) where it becomes clear that her husband is on the prosecuting side of a family dispute that is putting everyone in danger - something her husband finds out shortly afterwards when he narrowly avoids an acid facial. Now \"Quinlan\" and his sidekick \"Menzies\" (Joseph Calleia) have a rather unique way of working - the former intimidates just with his presence and has the District Attorney in his pocket, but as this investigation starts to spread out the original crime pails into insignificance as \"Susan\" finds herself trapped in an out of town motel and the potential victim of a ghastly drug crime that brings the threads of the story - and the true criminality to light - fatally. There are five principal characters and the actors do justice to them all - the story moves along darkly offering plenty of interest, the odd red herring and a particularly strong effort from Welles as the increasingly unlikeable policeman. I was slightly dubious about Heston playing a Mexican policeman, but here carries of the role in one of his better screen performances (when he is not wearing leather garments) and Janet Leigh - well, she was always an actor who made it all look effortless. The ending combines the scary with the brutal but will the truth be out? Big screen must for the full potency of the last twenty minutes.", "**It's not Orson Welles' best work, and there are some problems and wrong choices, but it's still a worthwhile film.**\r\n\r\nOne crime and two totally different men: this sentence almost sums up the entire film. Director Orson Welles is one of those monsters that we are used to having like a \u201csacred cow\u201d, who turns everything he touches into gold. And really, he is responsible for great films and was an excellent artist, who understood cinema like few others did. However, in this film, his work was absolutely trampled on by stupid studio managers, and the result of this is that it was only very recently that it was possible to have access to a version of this film that was similar to what its director's creative vision was. . Just similar!\r\n\r\nAnd what we have here is an incredibly complex film that we cannot summarize as easily as I did: the initial crime is just the incident that triggers the action, and its relevance, we found, is really insignificant. What counts here is the struggle of personalities, the battle between the conflicting egos of two police officers who decide to solve the case, each in their own way. In fact, it is not the most appealing film that the director's career has given us, but it is still valuable for that reason. And to understand Welles' vision, it's not enough to see the film once. We have to understand nuances that go unnoticed by an inattentive eye. It's an exercise for cinema experts, more than for me, who am part of the common popcorn-eating public, but even I saw that the work before me deserved to be seen in detail.\r\n\r\nThe film that has come down to us allows us to see the brilliance of Welles, who was also responsible for the dialogues and the script created, full of twists and turns that can complicate things a little for us if we are not paying attention, and, but it also gives us good actors in a decent dramatic exercise. Charlton Heston is a safe bet, but it's also a big casting mistake: he's too Anglo-Saxon to be credible as a Latino! Welles brought the other main character to life, and is effective and dominant in the role. To a certain extent, he never seems like a police officer, but just another criminal in a land where those in charge are those who impose themselves through violence. Even so, I noticed that he is a physically worn-out man, and this fragility ruins the effect he intends to achieve.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has many qualities, starting with the cinematography, which in Welles' films is almost always one of the director's signatures. In addition to the use of intelligent visual effects, the director dedicated himself to the camera work and the choice of each perspective, each framing, and also in the editing, which was ruined by the studio's intervention. The filming locations and sets are realistic and convince us quite well, and the soundtrack is effective."], ["He nose you know!\r\n\r\nChinatown is directed by Roman Polanski and written by Robert Towne.

Gittes (Nicholson) is working on an adultery case but quickly finds himself embroiled in murder and corruption.\r\n\r\nThe gathering of Polanski, Towne, Nicholson and Robert Evans (producer) put their respective skills together to craft one of the most lauded neo-noir films of all time. It's a searing picture awash with the staples of the film noir and gumshoe detective movies that graced cinema in the 40s and 50s. From the characterisations (suspicious femmes - mouthy coppers - sleazy kingpin - tough protagonist in a whirlpool of unravelling layers), to the hard boiled script, violence, sex and brutal revelations, it's a noir essential that only lacks chiaroscuro and expressionistic swirls to seal the complete deal.\r\n\r\nAllegoraries unbound, iconography assured and dialogue now in the lexicon of legends, Chinatown is not to be missed, not just by fans of noir, but fans of cinema, period. 9.5/10", "**Great.**\r\n\r\nI can't say much about Roman Polanski because I feel I've seen too little of his work to make a more global analysis: I have only seen _The Ninth Gate_, _The Pianist_ and, now, this film. It's not much\u2026 but the truth is that they are three films that I really liked, and about which I have a very good opinion. This film is very good, fitting into a style that we can call \u201cneo-noir\u201d, insofar as its visual aesthetic is heavily inspired by noir, with the caveats that are due, as it is a color film and not black and white. Polanski is an attentive and meticulous director, who provides the audience with quality work, in which every detail has been thought of.\r\n\r\nWith a story set in San Francisco during the 1930s, the film is very similar to the gangster movies that came out in the 40's and 50's. The story revolves around a private detective, an ex-cop, who is hired to watch a man in what appears to be just another case of adultery. Everything changes when he discovers that the woman who hired him is not a jealous wife. The search for answers will lead him to a web of intrigue and crimes that involves an important Californian company and a public works contract that can be decisive for the city's water storage. It's an excellent story, capable of holding us in the first few minutes and that harmoniously combines tension, romance and suspense, in the right measures.\r\n\r\nIn addition to an excellent story, with a very well written script, the film presents us with a high quality cast headed by Jack Nicholson, at a time when he was still young and elegant enough to play heartthrob roles. The actor is very good and leaves in this film one of the most interesting works of his career. Faye Dunaway is not far behind and is simply wonderful, dignified and elegantly seductive, as a \u201cfemme fatale\u201d should be. John Huston (Nicholson's father-in-law in real life, at this time) also appears in the film and makes a very positive and interesting participation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these qualities, the film also has superb production values: impeccably shot, with great angles and sharpness, it has very good cinematography, beautiful colors and light and shadow effects, in addition to excellent sepia tones that are called reinforcing the dominant \"vintage\" ambience. The film was a very detailed production, in which special attention was given to the creation of the sets and the choice of filming locations, so that everything fit well into the historical period. The choice of cars (which are important in the course of the plot) and the design of the costumes and props was also very careful. Last but not least, a note of praise for the excellent soundtrack, which was conceived by Jerry Goldsmith.", "I think this might be my favourite role from Faye Dunaway. She is \"Evelyn\", a woman who suspects that her husband \"Hollis\" (Darrell Zwerling) is playing away from home. She engages the services of the cynical PI \"Gittes\" (Jack Nicholson) and pretty soon people are dead and he is embroiled in an internecine story of adultery, corruption and manipulation that proves pretty perilous for a detective who is working with one women he suspects is being a bit frugal with the truth and another whose identity he is desperately struggling to discover. Nicholson is also on super form, his performance is natural and engaging with a solid chemistry between his and Dunaway adding a richness to this rather quirky plot. Roman Polanski has assembled a strong supporting cast - notably John Huston who features sparingly but effectively as her wealthy, untrustworthy, father \"Noah\" and the photography does a great deal to help generate a sense of accumulating intrigue as we gradually make some headway through this complicated and interesting character study. The production looks great - the 1930s costume and motor cars alongside a smattering of the simmering attitudes that prevailed at the time are encapsulated well too. It's a shade over two hours, but it hits the ground running and never really stops until the ending that though not entirely unexpected, still has enough elements of surprise to keep it compelling."], ["My all-time favourite movie!

Also, I've had many friends like Chris, being tough on the outside, while sweet on the inside, and I've known people like Vern, Teddy and Denny too :) Beautiful music, acting and truth about growing up, as relevant today as it was in the 80s/50s :) <3", "Ok everyone - this is a 80's kid about kids, but don't think it is like the others as it is a Stephen King adaptation. It isn't for kids - unless you want to traumatize them.\r\n\r\nComing of age at a high price, what makes this a special one on that decade.\r\n\r\nA solid 8.2 out of 10.0 / A in my score.", "**A good film about the value of friendship and companionship.**\r\n\r\nThis is one of those films that becomes adorable not only because of what it shows and tells us, but also because of the affective memories it awakens in us, or even because of the messages it brings and which it explains in its narrative. The value of friendships is a more than common theme in cinema, but perhaps this is one of the most paradigmatic and memorable films when the subject is precisely that.\r\n\r\nVery consistently based on a book by Stephen King, the plot is simple: four young friends get together to find the corpse of a boy who disappeared, and set off on a long journey on foot that will take them through a series of obstacles and difficulties, and that will test the friendship and unity of the group. The matter itself ends up being quite irrelevant, no one cares about the dead boy. What matters is the journey of the four boys and the way they overcome difficulties, forgetting their differences and what eventually separates them. Each of them has their own sad story: broken homes, families with little structure, domestic violence, dramatic family losses (a father, an older brother\u2026). In short, none of them is a boy born with a silver spoon or into a well-positioned family. And the film explores this very well, with inspired dialogue and absolutely believable and well-conceived situations.\r\n\r\nRob Reiner is a very effective director who knows very well what he wants. One of the points in which he shined most was in choosing the filming locations, designing the sets and reconstituting the period (the film takes place in the late 1950s, at the height of the post-war \u201cAmerican dream\u201d): the director It really manages to transport us to the past and to magnificently designed and credible places. Another point he valued was the choice of actors for the four main characters. In addition to being a perfect fit in terms of age and physique, Corey Feldman, Jerry O\u2019Connell, River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton are very talented and do their best with their characters and their material. Without the effort of these four young people, the film would not have the strength it has.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film stands out for its good cinematography, the sets, costumes and props that I mentioned above, the choice of period cars and an excellent soundtrack, featuring some iconic melodies of the time."], [], ["This remake was always going to struggle to match the excellent 1962 version, and although it is not nearly as compelling, it is still an half decent attempt. Liev Schreiber is acclaimed Gulf War veteran and now Congressman \"Raymond Shaw\" who is very much in the running for Vice-President of the USA - egged on by his even more ambitious Senator mother (Meryl Streep). Meantime, his wartime captain \"Marco\" (Denzel Washington) is recovering from an injury sustained during an ambush - only he is struggling to reconcile his memories of that event with those being put forward by \"Shaw\" and, almost verbatim, by his fellow soldiers. Upon more detailed investigation, \"Marco\" stumbles upon the most unique of conspiracies that calls him to question not just his own sanity, but the nature of events both past and present. The more he digs, the more doors close before him and pretty soon both he and we know that there is some sort of conspiracy that goes right to the heart of American democracy. The story has been updated from the original and that helps it to stand on it's own a bit more. Washington is effective, as is Schreiber as the plot thickens and the prospects of a terrifying form of psychological warfare begin to loom large, presenting us with a story of manipulation and power-lust that is distinctly Machiavellian. Meryl Streep does OK, but sadly her's is the role that comes off worst by comparison with Angela Lansbury from first time round. The former is undoubtedly an accomplished actress, but somehow she doesn't quite exude the same degree of toxic charm. It also really does take it's time to get going, but once in it's stride it offers us quite an intriguing, if wordy, look at just how the American political establishment might work, and how it might, equally, be up for shrewd exploitation. It's a solid effort and worth a watch, but original is definitely much more sinister and best!"], ["**A duel of generations, a school, angry teenagers and lots of rock.**\r\n\r\nThis is a film for young adults that takes advantage of traditional teenage rebellion and the talent of Christian Slater, a good script and a good soundtrack. It's not masterful, but it's ideal for a Saturday afternoon and has aged very well: thirty years after it was made and marketed, it's still young and fresh.\r\n\r\nThe story focuses on a clandestine radio station created by an angry and angry teenager who was forced to move house and is in a place where he doesn't know anyone and doesn't even feel comfortable. The radio is an outlet, it is a means of expressing inner anger, and it is nothing truly serious, but it becomes increasingly relevant as it acquires a very loyal local audience, who listen to him as if he were a guru without even knowing it. his identity, and allows himself to be carried away by his words in a wave of riots and protests that are directed, in particular, against the management of the local high school.\r\n\r\nThe story is quite good, it is well written, and the duel between the two characters (the young teenager assumed to be the radio presenter and the plenipotentiary director of the school) mirrors not only the oldest conflict of generations but also the permanent conflict between powerful and weak in society. None of this is particularly new, but the way it is served and presented was creative and wonderfully entertaining. The problem here is that it's a film for teenagers, it's too light, and it lacks secondary characters that are at least as complete and impactful as the two central characters.\r\n\r\nChristian Slater lived in his youth, the happiest days of his career, and gave us good characters in good films. With time and success, he became a star and almost a synonym of rebellion and irreverence, an apprentice of James Dean who exploded onto the screen, guaranteeing the success of his films and the influx of young people to the cinema. Time, however, would show that Slater was, in each film, playing a single character, which was the one he tried to revive in his personal life, increasingly complicated by addictions and problems with the authorities. Annie Ross, on the other hand, gives us mature, well-developed work, suitably dark and dense, never allowing Slater to feel alone in the spotlight.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, it is in the soundtrack that we find the film's strong point. The songs include hit songs by Leonard Cohen, Pixies, Ivan Neville and Cowboy Junkies, and most of them are very easy to know for anyone who lived through the 90s and 2000s, that is, everyone or almost everyone. The rest doesn't really matter: with no mistakes to regret, it doesn't exceed the average at any particular point."], ["Frenetic roller-coaster ride - Capra style!\r\n\r\nThe Broadway show this film is based on ran for something like four years, such was the yearning for riotous rompathons in the 40s, and thus here the Capra adaptation is pretty much non stop mania. Led by the perfectly cast Cary Grant, the film barely pauses for breath, stopping only briefly to put a bit of creepy menace into the otherwise insane plot. Oh yes the plot, the elderly Brewster sisters are the dear hearts of the neighbourhood, but what folk don't realise is that they are poisoning elderly male visitors to their home to save them from being lonely! This sets us up for romps as nephew Mortimer (Grant) lurches from one incredulous scene to another upon finding out about his dear Aunt's penchant for murder.\r\n\r\nPeter Lorre & Raymond Massey add to the madness upon visiting the house, whilst John Alexander almost steals the film as the barmy uncle who thinks he is Theodore Roosevelt! But it's Grant's show all the way, rarely will you see an actor express so many faces of incredulity with such mirthful results as what Grant gives us here. A joyous performance from the great man. Directed with all the sharpness and knowing of tones we expect from Frank Capra, the film is an out and out joy. So be sure to wear a corset to stop your sides from splitting. 9/10", "There are thirteen bodies in the cellar!  Oh, piffle.\r\n\r\nDrama critic Mortimer Brewster has just gotten married.  But his newfound wedded bliss is interrupted by the disturbing discovery that his sweet old spinster aunts have been murdering lonely old men with their homemade elderberry wine, and burying the bodies in the cellar.  This demented screwball comedy was the film that introduced me to Cary Grant.  The utterly black comedic treatment never gets old, and the laughs never let up.  Every time he gets another surprise, Grant puts on a slightly different flustered expression.  Peter Lorre and Raymond Massey, as the villains of the piece, are very amusingly sinister, and the spinster aunts Brewster are utterly charming, in spite of their, uh, somewhat morbid hobby.  It's a hilariously insane romp from the brilliant director of some of America's greatest films, Frank Capra.  Do yourself a favor and watch it already!  Prepare to laugh nonstop.  As Mortimer Brewster says, \"Insanity runs in my family.  It practically gallops!\"", "**An extraordinary comedy that stands out for its unpretentiousness.**\r\n\r\nI didn't have high expectations when I decided to watch this film, and I think this increased the impact it ended up having even more: based on a successful play, the film is an extraordinary comedy full of bizarreness and mischief, without a single dead moment and full of twists and turns that make us laugh and amuse us.\r\n\r\nThe script begins with the sudden marriage of Mortimer Brewster, a famous theater critic known for being a bachelor. When preparing his bags for his honeymoon trip, the young man discovers that the two elderly aunts he has been living with are two remorseless killers, who believe they are doing enormous good by speeding up the deaths of lonely men. and sad people who will knock on their door to rent a room and sleep. Furthermore, their brother, who lives in that house, firmly believes that he is President Theodore Roosevelt and is digging the Panama Canal in the basement. And as if the madness wasn't enough, Mortimer has a crazy, murderous brother. The dialogues and situations are memorable, and the humor is contagious.\r\n\r\nI can understand why Cary Grant didn't like the work he did in this film: he really exaggerates his performance, he's histrionic, he spends almost half the film hysterical. However, this is funny and the character, and the script, asked the character to be this way. The actor, despite himself, knew how to understand what the character was asking of him and act accordingly. Veterans Jean Adair and Josephine Hull don't disappoint, offering us a truly brilliant interpretation, and the same can be said of Raymond Massey. The film also features the participation and worthy efforts of Peter Lorre and John Alexander.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film is reasonably discreet and focuses on effectiveness. The setting \u2013 the house where everything happens \u2013 is the most striking element that catches our attention. Apparently, it was made entirely in the studios, and it was a colossal, huge set. The costumes are also good, and the cinematography is quite pleasant and well executed."], ["**An unfairly forgotten film, quite emotional, that women will find very good and men may or may not like, depending on their tolerance for films with a greater sentimental charge.**\r\n\r\nDirector Jon Avnet brings us a good film that reminds us of the value of good friendships and self-love. Intelligently directing his crew and cast, he managed to make a discreet, unpretentious but very enjoyable film that easily wins over the audience. Still, it's bland and tepid, and perhaps that's precisely why it ended up as forgotten as it is.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest points is clearly the cast, headed by two solid and talented actresses: Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy. None of them are big names within the film industry, nor do they draw crowds to a \u201cmultiplex\u201d simply by appearing on a poster. However, they are very experienced, knowledgeable about this art of acting and capable of credibly interpreting their characters. For me, it's Tandy's best film, even deserved her an Oscar nomination. In addition to the skill of the two protagonists, it is fair to mention the contributions of Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker. Unfortunately, the male cast is very subdued which, combined with the melodramatic tone, makes the film more interesting for a female audience.\r\n\r\nSet in Alabama, the story deals with the friendship between two women: they both feel alone, one of whom lives in a nursing home and doesn't talk to many people and the other is trapped in a dead marriage and has lost her self-esteem. The film discusses friendship, racism, violence, the connection to our roots, and there are many friendly and likeable characters. In fact, the emotional charge sometimes seems excessive. I don't see this as a problem, but a feature that will please some more than others. For me, it didn't take away any interest I might have had, but I'll understand if men say they feel a little queasy with so much mushiness. What bothered me most about the film was the length and the way it took a while to get interesting: on the one hand, I found it difficult to get interested in the first half hour and, on the other hand, I felt that it was a little stretched out in running time.\r\n\r\nWith such strong bets on the script and cast, the film did not need to invest too heavily in effects or technical aspects. All he had to do was be careful not to make mistakes and to do things well, and that's precisely what was done: from the cinematography to the costumes, through the visual and sound effects, the soundtrack or the choice of filming locations and scenarios, the film stands out for its effectiveness and elegance, but without being too daring, remaining in familiar and comfortable terrain where it manages to do well what needs to be done."], ["A masterpiece of tightly plotted drama/suspense in what would become The Adult Western. Normally, one is happiest on your wedding day, but former lawman Will Kane is troubled.\r\n\r\nAn old nemesis is due on the noon train, and his gang is in town to meet him. He's sworn to kill the man who sent him to prison, so the expected action is to flee.\r\nBut weighed down with a new bride and traveling in a buckboard, there's no chance of escape.\r\n\r\nSeeking help to at least face down the gang, Will Kane returns to town, and finds that everybody either won't or can't Do The Right Thing. The inaction of the town is a thinly disguised parable of The Cold War, with the U.S. standing alone against the Red Menace\r\n\r\nAs Will Kane walks through the silent town, which he \"served and protected\" for years, we are left to wonder if we would do the same. 8/10", "This is just a dirty little village in the middle of nowhere. Nothing that happens here is really important.\r\n\r\nWill Kane (Gary Cooper) is a retiring lawman all set to leave the town of Hadleyville with his new bride Amy (Grace Kelly). But word comes that a notorious gunslinger he put in prison has been released and is heading to town with his gang intent on bloody revenge. With a sense of fearless duty Kane decides to stay and sets about enlisting a posse, however, he finds that nobody in the town that he made safe for everyone will aid him in his mission.\r\n\r\nThe 1950s saw a big shift in styles for the American Western. After the yee-haw Cowboy Vs Indians excess of the 40s, the decade was ushered in by such films as Broken Arrow. Showing the Native Americans in a sympathetic light, Broken Arrow also showed that clearly Westerns had much more to offer than frothy shoot them up entertainment. Which brings us to High Noon, a black and white Oater that landed in 1952 and is still today revered as a quintessential classic Western. Which is not bad considering there's no gun-play here until the last five minutes of the 85 minute running time.\r\n\r\nWhat makes High Noon so significant is that it's not a big movie in terms of production. There's no reams of extras dashing around in glorious Technicolor, no sprawling vistas inhabited by colourful characters, this is pretty understated stuff. Yet thematically it's as big as it gets, a lesson in character drama where not a frame is wasted. From the unforgettable opening of three bad men (Lee Van Cleef, Robert Wilkie, Sheb Wooley) waiting at the station while Tex Ritter's ballad explains the plot, to the now legendary and iconic ending, High Noon simmers with suspense and intensity as the story unravels - all told in real time too.\r\n\r\nBased on a short story called The Tin Star written by John W. Cunningham, High Noon is directed metronomically by Fred Zinnermann and is shot in high contrast by cinematographer Floyd Crosby. Thus the film has a documentary feel to it, giving it an authentic edge so rarely seen in the Western genre. The piece is further boosted by the performance of Cooper. Winning the Oscar for best male performance, Cooper was 50 years old and into his third decade as a movie star. His prancing around in Western days were reducing by the month, yet High Noon shows it to be one of the finest casting decisions made in the 50s. In agony from a back injury and other ailments during the shoot, Cooper carries the movie with brilliant sincerity, conveying the pain of a man now alone as he trundles towards doom. The realisation is that all his heroism and graft that made Hadleyville a safe place for women and children to live, now counts for nothing, it's a heavy weight on Kane's shoulders. It's here where Cooper excels, there's no histrionics or drawn out speeches, it's through expressions and body movements that the story gains its emotional momentum. A remarkable turn from a remarkable actor, proof positive that you didn't need a dashing leading man to propel your movie.\r\n\r\nThe film notoriously angered Howard Hawks & John Wayne, the themes and the perceived allegory for blacklisting a bone of contention that led to them making Rio Bravo as a riposte in 1959. There's many an essay on High Noon and the links to Senator Joe McCarthy, HUAC etc etc, so really I have no interest in going there. Instead I think it's just fitting to say that Zinnermann himself always resisted talking in terms of allegorical interpretations for his film. He, rightly so, felt to do that would be unfair and dampen the huge significance of his wonderful movie.\r\n\r\nAmen to that. 10/10", "I am guessing that High Noon is one of those seminal films that influenced the western genre immensely for a long time. The fifties? That is back when we wanted our heroes to be heroic. No greed or cruelty or inconsistent morals were allowed. Marshall Will Kane states near the beginning that he has to stick around for the evil Frank Miller to show up. Then he admittedly has a bit of a wobble when it seems the whole town, including his new Quaker wife, is telling him to leave. It is his time in the wilderness fighting the devil of easy-ways-out, But in the end he is Marshall Will Kane sticking around because it was the right thing to do. Hero time, and it works.\r\n\r\nIt is not all that works. This movie uses a can\u2019t miss formula to build up suspense. We are told early on that the bad guys will be sauntering into town after the noon train arrives, and then the rest of the way we catch glimpses of clocks to keep us informed about how much longer it will be for the payoff scenes.  Tick, tick, tick. The back story of several of the characters is laid out for us while it slowly becomes clear that the Marshall is on his own. I will say no more abut the plot.\r\n\r\nYou must not watch this with a jaundiced eye. If you find yourself thinking, man, I have seen this or that in so many westerns, remember that those other westerns likely came after this one. Watch it for its craftsmanship in how it tells a simple story expertly, and keep an eye on that clock. Tick, tick, tick.", "Gary Cooper is great in this tightly-packed revenge western. Newly married to \"Amy\" (the sparingly used but effective Grace Kelly) he has decided to stop being the town marshal and live a more peaceful life. It's on that very day, however, that he discovers that the outlaw \"Miller\" (Ian MacDonald), whom he sent to jail years earlier has been released and is heading back on the noon train to settle some old scores. \"Kane\" initially concludes that discretion is the better side of valour and decides to skedaddle, but a change of heart sets up a potential conflict that he soon discovers his cowardly townsfolk have little stomach to support him through. Fred Zinnemann allows Cooper and the very effective Thomas Mitchell as the spineless mayor \"Henderson\" to work well in building up a toxic mix of double-standards and fear whilst always fuelling the anticipation of the inevitable duel that's got to happen at the denouement. Dimitri Tiomkin's score and the Carl Foreman adaptation of the original short story help to keep this taut, exciting and puts this up there amongst the best of the genre. A classic example of concise and engaging storytelling with a strong cast and a solid story.", "**When a film becomes a manifesto of political discontent.**\r\n\r\nUsually, we are used to seeing extremely virile western films, full of masculine strength and American pride. And in fact the \u201ccowboy\u201d is a symbol of American strength and persistence: he is a loner, individualist, independent, who faces the most arduous situations with tenacity and ingenuity. However, this film is much sadder and even darker: faced with the arrival of a fearsome bandit, willing to take revenge for having been arrested, the sheriff of a Wild West village, who is about to be relieved of his post after a few years of very good and selfless service to the community, asks everyone for help and everyone leaves him to his fate, they even laugh at him! At a certain point, even his wife, the person he cares the most, seems willing to leave him alone in the face of danger. Is it somber enough?\r\n\r\nTo understand this bitter vision, we need to go back in time and revisit the entire creative process that led to the film's conception. In 1952, the USA was far from being a calm country: while most people feared the expansion of the Soviet threat in the world, Senator McCarthy led a true \u201ccommie hunt\u201d in the State apparatus and in cultural and social life because of alleged anti-American activities by members and supporters of the Communist Party. Public inquiries and cleanups gave this period the appearance of an authentic fascist dictatorship and ruined the lives and careers of people who, sometimes, had little or nothing to do with communism. It is no coincidence that Carl Foreman, the film's screenwriter and one of those targeted in this purge, imbued this film with so much disenchantment. Through the abandonment of a fair and honest man, he expressed the resentment and dismay of a large amount of actors and film professionals who, suddenly, found themselves interrogated, humiliated and sometimes ostracized. From this perspective, this film is a true manifesto, deserving its place on the list of relevant films in American history.\r\n\r\nThe film is short, concise and quite pragmatic in its production. The sets and costumes, the effects and the period recreation, everything follows practical and functional criteria that make it work without trying to surprise. The cinematography, in black and white, is very good and the train arrival, as well as the final fight scene, are particularly memorable. The soundtrack is marked by a sung theme that has become very famous, but which I couldn't help but consider excessively intrusive and annoying after a certain point. In addition to this, we have an effective direction by Fred Zinnemann and a very strong cast, with solid names such as the veteran Gary Cooper, the elegant Grace Kelly and the competent Lloyd Bridges. Each does their job with care, but Cooper deserves a special praise for the way he brought to life a hero who is as human, vulnerable and ordinary as any man. I also enjoyed seeing the dignified Katy Jurado in a very strong role."], [], ["**Peter Sellers' big farewell in a film that highlights his more chivalrous side.**\r\n\r\nThere are films that, even though they're good, cannot be consensual, and this is one of them. It's a film that conquers admirers as easily as it accumulates people who didn't understand it or didn't like it for whatever reason. I confess that I liked it, but I can understand both sides. The film has qualities, but it also presents a story that is not pleasant, and that is so far-fetched that it could never actually take place in real life.\r\n\r\nThe film presents a friendly character who is not easy to be indifferent to: Chance is a gardener who loves what he does and is very good at taking care of plants, but who was educated in a very informal way, confined inside a man's house. boss he served his entire life, without ever leaving, without ever going to school, without having any idea of the world around that house. The only glimpse of the world he had was through television, which he watches daily and with pleasure. When the boss dies, he is evicted from that house by lawyers who were not even aware of his existence. Without education, home or even documents, he wanders around the city and, by luck, ends up in the house of a very rich banker, ingratiating himself with his family with his adages which, however vague and inconsistent they may be, are taken as authentic pearls. of wisdom.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that there are very wise people in the world who have never set foot in school nor know how to sign their name. These are people who, having not had the opportunity to attend education in their lives, replaced it with a rich life experience and have very valuable empirical knowledge. I know people like that. However, it is inconceivable that someone has lived their entire existence within a house where they serve without ever leaving for anything, and without having documents of any kind. The script makes a mistake here, it exaggerates its proposition, and people's reactions afterwards are equally exaggerated and unreasonable. I recognize this.\r\n\r\nHowever, the beauty of the tale created around the figure of this gardener, who never loses his purity, his kindness, is undeniable. And we really have to surrender to Peter Sellers' magnificent performance. The actor provides us with a discreet and elegant work in which he highlighted his best features, a restrained, almost aristocratic posture and slow, absolutely clear and well-pronounced diction. Unfortunately, he is almost the only actor to deserve a positive rating: Shirley Maclaine, Melvyn Douglas and Jack Warden are good, but they appear absolutely bland and disinterested here."], ["Harry Dean Stanton is on cracking form here the amnesiac \"Travis\". He turns up in a Texan clinic dressed in a striped suit, but recalling little for the slightly roguish doctor who helps him after some dehydrating time in the desert to use to help identify him. A tiny scrap of paper in his wallet enables him to, though, and soon \"Walt\" (Dean Stockwell) arrives to try and get his long-lost brother back to his own home in Los Angeles. As the story now gradually unfolds, we discover that \"Travis\" has a son who lives with \"Walt\" but we are unsure as to just what has led him to his current, absent-minded, predicament. Unwilling to fly, the two take the long road trip back getting to know each other and slowly building a renewed sense of trust before he is to be re-introduced to the son (Hunter Carson) he hasn't seen for four years and who requires some answers of his own. The last half hour brings the threads together neatly, if a little conveniently, allowing a few brief appearances from Nastassja Kinski that brings the story of \"Travis\" and his trauma full circle. To be honest, I found the actual plot rather weak, indeed the story isn't up to much at all really - it's the performance from HDS that is measured and engaging. His flawed character gradually comes out of his self-induced shell as it seems he is learning about himself almost at the same pace as we are - and that makes the film compelling for the most part. It's a story that takes it's time, and watching it I found it did take me a few minutes to get myself into a suitably low gear to appreciate it. It's isn't a plod, or a slow watch - it is a nuanced, occasionally amusing, search for identity - oh, and for a field in Paris, Texas!", "**A film full of qualities, but which will not please the general public.**\r\n\r\nThere are films that are made for commercial audiences and others that are clearly made to please specialized critics and film theorists. Although this film was present on the commercial circuit, the truth is that Wim Wenders directed this film for critics and film festival audiences, and this explains why critics love it and why the general public hardly knows this work. . About me? To be quite honest, I didn't particularly like the film, and it's not the kind of film I like to watch or watch with pleasure. However, I am the first to recognize that it is a work full of artistic and technical qualities, and that it deserves a close look by any student and fan of the seventh art.\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around a man who spent four years wandering through desert areas of Texas due to a huge psychological shock. We don't know what he suffered, but it is obvious that he is not well when he is finally rescued by his brother, and he spends a long time without saying a word, just trying to resume his march to nowhere. As the plot develops, we understand the emotional void he feels and desperately seeks to fill. The reunion with his son, whom he hadn't seen for years, will mark the beginning of a journey of inner healing, of reuniting with himself and the hurts of his past. The idea of family, the crisis of moral and social values, the role of men and women in marriage and the absence of feelings are themes that the film, very discreetly, addresses throughout the story it tells us.\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to see this film should prepare themselves for a long, very visual experience: the film is a grueling two and a half hours long and the action is quite slow. Wenders, who even thought about becoming a painter, likes to work very carefully on the visual and pictorial side of his films, and the slow action allows him, in this specific case, to explore to the maximum the visual beauty of desert scenes or urban landscapes. of Texas, where the action is concentrated. Do I need to say that the choice of sets and filming locations was one of the aspects that I liked most? Thanks to a good cinematography job, each one looks even more beautiful, wild and rude. Harmonizing perfectly with all this, the soundtrack, on guitar, plays a little with the Wild West and with the melodies that we usually associate with the Western style.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a very well done and solid plot, and good visual and technical values, the film also features the extraordinary work of Harry Dean Stanton. The actor has never been one of those stars that draws crowds, but he has quality and gives us here, probably, the best work of his film career. He is solid and impactful enough to capture our full attention with a minimum of words and facial expressions, and he doesn't say a word or change his facial expression during the first half hour of the film. The film also has excellent contributions from Dean Stockwell and Nastassja Kinski, and even young Hunter Carson does a well-done job. However, the stage is all Stanton's."], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["Ernest Thesiger is superb in James Whale's sequel to \"Frankenstein\" as the scientist who has perfected the art of growing rather than harvesting tissue. When he meets up with Baron Frankenstein's original monster they set about coercing the reluctant Baron to create a wife for the lonely Boris Karloff. This is a cracking tale of science fiction, horror and even romance as the monster ends up endowed with far more \"humanity\" than either scientist. Una O'Connor and Elsa Lanchester are both great too, though feature sparingly. The special effects stand better scrutiny than many a sci-film being made twenty years later and the cannibalised classical musical score brings tension, joy, love and despair a-plenty to compensate for, admittedly a rather stilted script.

It has a story arc and comes to a clear ending in the third flick. \r\n\r\nValerie Hobson is a highlight on the female front as Elizabeth Frankenstein (replacing Mae Clarke from the first film). Meanwhile Elsa Lanchester plays the dual role of Mary Shelley and the titular character at the end.\r\n\r\nThe prologue presents a glaring issue since Mary conveys this sequel to Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley not long after the success of \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d which was published in 1818. Since the film obviously contains fashions & technology of the early 1930s mixed with elements of the 1800s (which the director described as an \u201calternate universe\u201d), Mary would have to be predicting what it would be like in the distant future, at least 1899 (which is the tomb\u2019s date on a recently deceased woman in the story).\r\n\r\nThis is one of those rare occasions where the sequel is better. It\u2019s marked by increased camp (but not overkill), the monster\u2019s memorable friendship with a blind man in the forest, and the fact that he learns to speak in a monosyllabic fashion (which Karloff objected to). It\u2019s an iconic addition to the Frankenstein story, a Gothic horror tragedy highlighted by unforgettable renditions of the monster and his \u201cbride.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe B&W movie runs 1 hour, 15 minutes, and was shot entirely in the studio at Universal Studios in Greater Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+"], ["I rewatched the 1992's Candyman in preparation for Nia DaCosta's (Little Woods) direct sequel, so I could get the most out of it without having to force my memory to kick in. Despite being addicted to Philip Glass' score of the original film, Bernard Rose's take on Clive Barker's short story isn't exactly one of my favorite classics, even though I appreciate it quite a bit. Expectations-wise, I didn't know the director beforehand, but I was curious to see what DaCosta could bring to the famous tale.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm not the right person to tackle the heavy themes depicted in the filmmaker's sophomore flick. From an evident, strong opinion about gentrification to the biased white critical lenses, the director has a clear vision and firm messages concerning cultural injustice. As a white European young man, I'm not going to pretend to have experience or even enough knowledge to approach these necessary, sensitive debates, so I'll let other critics, namely Black authors, spread their voices.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I have mixed feelings about this sequel. Despite being beautifully shot (John Guleserian), edited (Catrin Hedstr\u00f6m), and scored (Robert A. A. Lowe), the thematically driven screenplay often feels forced and occasionally preachy. Characters are thinly developed through an uncommonly too short runtime. The never-ending silhouette recaps of the previous movie are unnecessary, and weirdly enough, a major revelation of this sequel is partially ruined by simply (re)watching the original film. The extreme gore is still present, though slightly toned down, at least from my perspective.\r\n\r\nTechnically and visually, it's truly one of the most interesting movies of the year. Sadly, it isn't able to transmit the same quality to the two pillars of filmmaking - story and characters.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C", "I'm a huge fan of Tony Todd as Candyman and always have been, this was a good story and the actors play their parts very well. However afterward it was kind of ruined for me when they all started talking about it being about racism.\r\n\r\nWhy did they have to make it about racism when it was enjoyable as a horror movie?", "_Candyman's_ story was intriguing and with spectacular visuals it is a decent watch, but for a horror film there was a significant lack of... horror. At no point in the film was there tension, dread, or a sense that I was being lead to a thrilling climax, it was more of a character study on Candyman. The character study aspect was great, I loved hearing the mythos of Candyman from different people in the community. The investigation into the backstory of Candyman paired with commentary on police brutality was really well done, but this was marketed as a horror film and it did not deliver. The cinematography was excellent, there were some really great shots utilizing mirrors and different angles but is that enough? In the end, this movie left me wanting much more.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _58%_\r\n**Verdict:** _Decent_", "I like the new Candyman. I don't love it, but I like it a lot. This film co-written and directed by Nia DaCosta wants to be the Wes Craven's New Nightmare of this franchise, and whenever it reaches that level, it hits a home run \u2014 especially when it comes to the eponymous monster, who has never been more sinister or menacing (Tony Todd, who originated the role in 1992, appears in a limited but effective capacity that transcends mere fanservice).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of 1992, DaCosta, who was three years old at the time, would not have been able to bring this project to fruition without the invaluable help of co-writers Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld, who know the material inside out and treat it with the same reverence that they it doubtless without inspired in them when they first encounter it in their teens. The filmmakers even get the comic relief right, and that\u2019s not something too many horror flicks can brag about.\r\n\r\nThe original Candyman \"was a horror movie that scared with ideas and blood, instead of just blood\" (Ebert); the new version lives up to this standard, creating a foreboding atmosphere with practical special effects rather than CGI. \r\n\r\nFor example, mirrors are Candyman's portal into our world, and the film makes the most of every reflecting surface \u2014 like when the protagonist, Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) gets into an elevator that somehow doubles as hall of mirrors.\r\n\r\nThe present co-exists nicely with the past (another touch as brilliant as bringing Todd back is using Virginia Madsen's voice on recordings made by her character in the first film) in Candyman, but the future is cause for concern. \r\n\r\nThis is not a remake, much less a reboot, but there is a 'passing the torch' \u2014 or, in this case, the hook \u2014 which I fear is meant to pave the way for more sequels. I can only hope that DaCosta, Peele, and Rosenfeld really appreciate Candyman as much as I think they do, and that having restored his dignity, they allow him to ride off into the sunset with it intact."], ["Meet Max Cady, the most terrific villain role De Niro ever played simply because he successfully portrayed a crook who possesses a very complex personality of being stone-cold, violent, absolutely merciless, also on the other hand quite witty and charismatic to ever lure Danielle Bowden (Juliette Lewis) into his trap when he pretended to be her drama teacher so convincingly. Martin Scorsese\u2019s Cape Fear tells the story of a brutal rapist who waited for so long just to be able to avenge his wrath towards Attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) for he believed that Bowden could have done much better in defending for his case. This film is well-told with so many suspense elements through some shocking events throughout the film. \r\n\r\nCape Fear is one of the examples of film whose remake, in some ways, considered outwits the original one produced in 1962 starred Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck. This is quite understandable remembering the remake was filmed many years later, with sufficient advancements in technology and financial supports. In Cape Fear, De Niro managed to portray the chilling Max Cady successfully. He had a best-laid plan to avenge his disappointments/hatred towards Bowden by studying laws in prison just to be able to find the flaws that in the end shall leave him untouchable by the law. \r\n\r\nSometimes it\u2019s amazing to understand how an actor/actress willing to go through for the sake of a role. Robert De Niro paid a dentist $5,000 to make his teeth look suitably bad for the role of Max Cady whereas right after filming, he paid $20,000 to have them fixed.  De Niro migh have been spectacular in portraying Cady but we also have to consider how remarkable and superb were Peck and Mitchum.", "**A really very good movie, and proof that there are remakes that are really worth it for their quality and good execution.**\r\n\r\nI've just seen this movie (which I've actually seen on television, but without paying enough attention to a movie I want to write something about) and once again I was very impressed. The truth is that, without wanting to legitimize the practice, which is often taken to exaggeration, there are remakes that manage to justify themselves, not only for the quality they demonstrate, but also for the gift, not to mention, of drawing the public's attention to the older movies. I can give my personal example: it was the contact with some remakes that made me know that there were older films and go looking for them to be able to see them.\r\n\r\nThis film maintains, without significant changes, the story told in the older film, which dates from 1962 and was starred by Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum: very briefly, it is the story of a lawyer who finds himself persecuted and threatened, with his wife and daughter, by a spiteful ex-con who blames him for many years of incarceration. Of course, there are things that change between the two films, and this film has the advantage of not giving us a simple story where a terribly bad man wants to harm a very nice man. Bowden, the lawyer, is a man with a past full of mistakes (much like many of us) who hasn't always been good at his job and his role as a husband and father, and we see that, and the way character is called upon to face the consequences. The sexual theme, which the original film attenuates a lot (due to the restrictions imposed on cinema at the time), is also more pronounced here, transforming Max Cady into an almost perfect pervert.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the nuances that make the film denser and with a more complex story, we can count on an excellent cast where Robert De Niro steals all the attention, thanks to a powerful, convincing and genuinely menacing interpretation. This film is worth seeing just to savor the actor's performance. Nick Nolte played attorney Sam Bowden, a man who desperately seeks to protect his family. The actor is good and does a good job. Much less interesting, Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis play the lawyer's wife and daughter in an ambiguous and sometimes very unpleasant way: Lange can still reasonably extricate herself from the challenge she has, but Lewis has turned her character into a kind of teenage nymphet who sees Cady as a terrifying sexual temptation rather than having the discernment and intelligence necessary to at least realize the risk her entire family is running. Also a reminder of the cameos of honor by Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam, three actors who were pivotal in the original film. Incidentally, this film would end up being the last in the life of Peck, who died shortly after.\r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese made this film as a means to an end, that is, a way to get the studio to invest in another film he wanted to make. Anyway, and for whatever reason, it was a good bet by the director. The film deserves our attention and is full of merits. The filming work and cinematography are excellent, the sets and costumes too, with an emphasis, of course, on the scenes on the Bowden houseboat. The effects were also well done, although not particularly extraordinary. The central score of this film is the same as its older counterpart, composed by Bernard Herrmann, one of the best and best conceived by the composer, and which is already part of the collective memory.", "\"Cady\" (Robert De Niro) is released from jail after serving eighteen years for rape. He alights on the doorstep of his erstwhile defending counsel \"Bowden\" (Nick Nolte) with his cigar and his red sports car and generally starts intimidating the man and his family. Why? Well it turns out that the lawyer had buried some evidence during the trial that may have cast doubt on the voracity of the evidence given by the victim - and so now, \"Cady\" has revenge in mind. Now I loved the 1962 version of this film - Robert Mitchum is superb - and so I was always a bit sceptical about this remake. No, this honestly isn't a patch on that version, but that's as much to do with it being in colour and with it featuring the really poorly cast Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange. De Niro thrives in his element as the manipulative and genuinely odious character whilst Martin Scorsese allows the tension to increase, the sense of desperation and control to blossom and for a genuine sense of peril to develop. Hats can also go off for a strong effort from Juliette Lewis as the daughter \"Danni\" - a naive young girl whom \"Cady\" soon has in his sights. The setting for the denouement is as good as cinema can offer - an houseboat and a rainstorm - and as remakes go, this is not bad at all."], ["***Atmospheric, artistic, dramatic horror in New Orleans***\r\n\r\n\"Cat People\" came out in 1982 and is a modern take on the classic 1942 film. Nastassja Kinski and Malcolm McDowell are siblings cursed to become were-panthers if sexually aroused. The only way they can become human again is to kill a fellow human. The idea is absurd and fantastical, but \"Cat People\" takes the subject absolutely seriously. John Heard plays a zoo manager who falls in love with Kinski\u2019s character, while Annette O'Toole plays the third person in the romantic triangle.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s engrossing and has style & pizazz. For instance, the flashback scenes of the ancient panther tribe doing rituals in an orange desert are surreal and captivating; the accompanying atmospheric music by Giorgio Moroder adds to the mood nicely, along with David Bowie\u2019s theme song. While both are decidedly 80\u2019s, they fit the flick and are somehow timeless.\r\n\r\nBoth Kinski and McDowell are properly cat-like. McDowell, as usual, has a weird and diabolic air about him. John Heard is fine as the protagonist and redhead O'Toole is simply gorgeous. Speaking of which, Kinski is indeed quite attractive, as observed in the scene of her fishing with Heard in hot pants and wader boots, but O'Toole steals Kinski\u2019s thunder a bit, particularly in the pool sequence.\r\n\r\nThis is a great flick for showcasing the New Orleans area and the Sothern Gothic ambiance thereof. Keep in mind that it\u2019s definitely a horror flick and so can be pretty brutal at times. On a related note, if nudity offends you then you might want to skip it as many of the characters are shown totally nude or near nude.\r\n\r\nThe film runs just shy of 2 hours and was shot in the New Orleans area with some stuff done in the Los Angeles region (e.g. studio work and the panther tree sequence). \r\n\r\nGRADE: B+/A-"], ["Did I kill one of your people, Murnau? I can't remember.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._", "If you were ever to be able to commit your imagination to film when you read Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" then I expect you would struggle to come up with anything more vivid than this. What is most striking is the wonderful detail as poor old estate agent \"Hutter\" is despatched to the home of \"Count Orlok\" (Max Schreck) to negotiate the acquisition of an isolated house for him. Once he arrives at the castle, we are subsumed in the eeriness and wickedness as it becomes clear that \"Orlok\" is an epitome of evil. Our story follows the travels of the \"Count\" from his castle to his new home - wreaking plague and havoc as he goes - until he arrives in the town inhabited by \"Ellen\" (a superbly vulnerable yet strong Greta Schr\u00f6der) - the wife of the estate agent who is hot on their heals. \"Ellen\" has an inkling as to how to kill their nemesis, but that would involve the ultimate sacrifice. Now I have a few slight niggles with it - the inter-titles in a gothic script are, frequently, very difficult to read and that does interrupt the narrative; the editing is just a little too brutal at times and I found the score oppressive - even on the more joyous, or optimistic, scenes it seemed just a bit too overpowering than is necessary, but these are trifles when compared to the beautiful photography. Schreck is magnificent in the title role, exuding menace and malevolence, Gustav von Wangenheim (\"Hutter\") conveys the sense of desperation and terror in a truly evocative manner and it all adds up to a taut horror film the likes of which you'll never see in any subsequent treatment of this story."], [], [], ["When Los Angeles starts blowing off a little more steam than usual, it falls to disaster emergency supremo \"Rourke\" (Tommy Lee Jones) to find out what is going on - and when that turns out to be an impending volcanic eruption, he enlists the help of \"Dr. Barnes\" (Anne Heche) to stop it destroying the city. To be fair, there are plenty of great pyrotechnics and the film pretty much starts in fourth gear - but the ending really lets it down. Not the science, that's quite entertaining as they have to use subway tunnels, storm drains and quite a bit of dynamite; it's the \"have to rescue my daughter\" nonsense that spoiled it for me. Maybe there ought to be a rule that anyone charged with such responsibility is not permitted to have a teenage child anywhere within a 200 mile radius of their zone of responsibility? Yes, there are plausibility issues too - has the construction industry really been hoodwinking us all for so long? Is demolition really this easy? It's still quite an enjoyable disaster movie, though, that shows well the dedication and commitment of the emergency services when it comes to scenarios like this, but most of the drama is noisily contrived and the performances are merely adequate."], ["Though definitely a guilty pleasure from the cheesy 80's of which I grew up, this is such outstandingly fun. It's so unique a cinematic experience, knowing what we know of Schwarzenegger's life and career the 34 years since, seeing him at this juncture, as he's just starting out. (No, I haven't seen 'Stay Hungry' yet.)\r\n\r\nPart of me always wishes he had simply stuck to these films (as well as the 'Terminator' series), and was still making them. In his prime, I dare you to find anyone better at this kind of material. Director Milius has a fine feel for the swords-and-sandals/fantasy worldscape this material requires. An excellent and underrated supporting cast is here at well to help Arnie out, too.", "***\"Sit here... SIT HERE\"***\r\n\r\nI was hugely disappointed by \"Conan the Barbarian\" (1982) when I first viewed it because it deviated too far from the blueprint established by creator Robert E. Howard. Yeah, they got many things right, but the things they got wrong ruined the film for me. Yet I\u2019ve warmed up to it over time because one can\u2019t deny the film\u2019s merits. If you\u2019re a fan of the books and the faithful comics, it\u2019s important to realize going in that this is an ALTERNATIVE Conan, similar to Howard's, but far from a strict interpretation. \r\n\r\nThe flaws mostly have to do with John Milius and Oliver Stone's deviation from Howard. Consider the opening sequence of Conan as a little boy on his father\u2019s knee getting advice about the trustworthiness of the sword: Sorry, but the lad looks like an average soft suburbanite boy, not a tough kid that grew up in the wilds of Cimmeria, land of darkness and deep night. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the \"wheel of pain\" sequence is just dumb. I have a bit more respect for this part now that I realize it's a metaphor for the cyclical drudgery of grade school but, c'mon, the REAL Conan wouldn't spend that many years in captivity! He would have escaped long before, not to mention slay his captors. I suppose it helps when consider that Stone & Milius were taking bits from Howard\u2019s other creations, like Kull, who was a slave for a few years.    \r\n\r\nThirdly, when they first meet Valeria while robbing the temple of Set the flick cops a decidedly campy tone. Although Sandahl Bergman is great throughout the rest of the picture that initial meeting is pretty cringe-inducing. It was at this point that I really tuned out when I first viewed the film. Fourthly, one of the worst parts is when Conan grovels at Thulsa Doom's feet crying, \"You killed my father; you killed my mother!\" This in no way resembles Howard's Conan. But, in its defense, it does make Conan more human and therefore more relate-able to the viewer. \r\n\r\nThankfully, the film has several strengths, starting with the magnificent and awe-inspiring score by Basil Poledouris. The movie's worth viewing just to hear this score. Secondly, despite acceptable discrepancies (e.g. Conan has black hair not brown), the casting is quite good; although Schwarzenegger doesn\u2019t really reflect the air of REH\u2019s character (Jason Momoa is far better). Thirdly, Milius & Stone show their brilliance by incorporating Genghis Khan's historical quote in Conan's response to \"What is best in life?\" Conan answers: \"To crush enemies, see dem driven before you and to hear da lamentation of der women.\" \r\n\r\nFourthly, the locations, sets and costuming are superb. They certainly got the LOOK of Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age right. Fifthly, As long as one is prepared to accept the deviation from Howard's Conan, the story keeps your interest throughout (which is my way of determining the worthiness of ANY flick). Sixthly, Sandahl Bergman is super sharp and sexy; she possesses a certain barbaric beauty essential to the role and it's hard not to gaze at her shapely form in awe when she's on screen. \r\n\r\nLastly, the overall tone of the film is quite serious and brooding. Despite Valeria's initial campy sequence mentioned earlier and a couple of amusing scenes with Mako, the film eludes the rut of camp (unfortunately the 1984 sequel cannot boast of this quality). \r\n\r\nSPECIAL MOMENTS AND INTERESTING ITEMS:\r\n\r\n\u2022The love scene between Conan & Valeria and, later, the death/funeral pyre scenes are reverent, beautiful and moving. The accompanying piece by Poledouris is emotionally potent.\r\n\r\n\u2022Conan's spiritual evolution in regards to sexuality and love is interesting: His first exposure is as a slave when beautiful women are occasionally thrown to him for the amusement of those watching. After he acquires his freedom his first (and presumably only) experience with casual sex goes horribly wrong. Later in Zamora he dismisses the solicitations of prostitutes with a wave and a derogatory word. Finally he meets Valeria and discovers true love and commitment, conveyed well in the love/death/funeral scenes noted above.\r\n\r\n\u2022Both the battles inside the mountain fortress and, later, the showdown at the mounds are thrilling with the accompanying score getting your blood pumping.\r\n\r\n\u2022Right before the battle at the mounds Conan and Subotai brace themselves as the 'riders of doom' trot forth. You can see the bold determination on their faces: They have no other recourse; they will stand and fight as men, come what may. (All men will eventually have to stand and fight in this manner one way or another, and we wuss out at our own peril).\r\n\r\n\u2022After their unlikely victory Conan raises his arms (and weapons) in salute to the altar where Valeria was cremated. It gives you goosebumps. \r\n\r\nBoth \"The Complete Quest\" and \"Collector's Edition\" contain an excellent 55-minute \"Making Of\" documentary wherein all of the principle actors and creators are interviewed, as well as an excellent commentary by Milius and Schwarzenegger. \r\n\r\nFINAL ANALYSIS: Like I said, I've finally come to see the magnificence of \"Conan the Barbarian,\" but I had to get over my hang ups concerning the deviations from Howard's Conan to see it. As an ALTERNATIVE Conan it's a nigh masterpiece of cinematic art. \r\n\r\nOne last thing: Um, don't use that first line of dialogue (\"Sit here... SIT HERE\") on your wife or girlfriend; I tried it and she didn't take too kindly to it!\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 9 minutes, and was shot in Spain. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"], ["***\u201cBy this Axe I Rule!\u201d***\r\n\r\nAn Atlantean barbarian (Kevin Sorbo) takes the throne of Valusia when he defeats King Borna (Sven-Ole Thorsen) and so General Taligaro (Thomas Ian Griffith) & assorted \u201cnoble-blooded\u201d men conspire to overthrow Kull by resurrecting the wicked Acheron sorceress Akivasha (Tia Carrere). Karina Lombard plays Kull\u2019s love interest, Zareta, while Litefoot is on hand as the priest Ascalante.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1997, thirteen years after the last Conan movie, \u201cKull the Conqueror\u201d was intended to be the third Conan film, but Schwarzenegger declined so they morphed it into a Kull movie. For those not in the know, Kull was author Robert E. Howard\u2019s other barbarian hero, who wasn\u2019t as popular as Conan. Kull, incidentally, existed thousands of years before Conan\u2019s Hyborian Age. The switch didn\u2019t really matter because the script was loosely based on Howard\u2019s Conan story \"The Phoenix on the Sword,\" which was a rewrite of the Kull yarn \u201cBy this Axe I Rule.\u201d\r\n\r\nSorbo was in his prime here and definitely looks like Kull from the comics, except he has his characteristic geniality whereas Kull was more grim and brooding in Howard\u2019s tales. Nevertheless, Sorbo is well cast and one of the film\u2019s highlights.\r\n\r\nThe score by Joel Goldsmith is quite good, except for a couple of semi-cheesy metal riffs, like the eye-rolling riff near the beginning and another one much later during the fight at the ice cave, which isn\u2019t as bad. At least half of the score lacks any metal guitar whatsoever and most of the pieces that do include it are very good; there\u2019s just a couple of dubious riffs, which turned me off the first time I watched the movie. These wannabe metal rhythms were rather lame in 1997, let alone today.\r\n\r\nAnother flaw is that the opening of the movie is weak with Kull\u2019s dealings with the Dragon Legion and his fiery sword fight with Taligaro. If you\u2019re patient, however, the story takes a compelling turn with the palace confrontation. The production is acceptable, but noticeably inferior to \u201cConan the Destroyer\u201d (1984). I\u2019d say it\u2019s on par with \u201cThe Sword and the Sorcerer\u201d (1982), but with a superior story and more interesting characters (once you get past the lousy opening). I should add that Tia looks great as a green-eyed redhead and the fiery demon F/X at the close are quite effective.\r\n\r\nIF you can handle its obvious shortcomings, \u201cKull the Conqueror\u201d is an entertaining S&S flick that should be enjoyed by fans of Conan, Sinbad and the like. If you watched it before and didn\u2019t like it, give it a second chance. I\u2019m glad I did. It\u2019s flawed, but there\u2019s too much to appreciate to give it a negative rating.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot in Slovakia (Bratislava & Cerveny Kamen) and Croatia (Kornati National Park & Murter Island).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"], ["I haven't seen _Wishmaster_ since I was a kid, I always enjoyed it back then, so I was nervous showing it to some friends that wouldn't withstand the test of time.

There's a fair few well known peeps behind them, including John Heard and Gary Cole - it's a fairly strong cast.\r\n\r\nThe story is an interesting one, though given that you'd expect the film to move along at a better pace but it kinda just walks through its 128 minute run time.

There are loads of films like this, such as \u201cAir Force One\u201d or \u201cOlympus Has Fallen\u201d, which may help to explain why it ended up so forgotten, despite being nominated for three Oscars (Best Editing, Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay). It's not a new film, but it guarantees action and entertainment, and looks very appealing to televisions and home market. In this case, the script focuses on the threat of a madman who is willing to do anything to assassinate the American president, and on the attempts of a veteran Secret Service agent to discover and prevent him.\r\n\r\nIn a film where the plot does not reserve any surprises or innovation, predictability can be a problem. In fact, there's nothing here that we haven't seen before. However, everything is done very competently and the commitment of all those involved is quite evident. The whole story is fairly well written and, apart from a few minor flaws, comes across as solid and credible. Wolfgang Petersen's direction also makes a decisive contribution to the positive outcome of the final product.\r\n\r\nThe cast contains several well-known names, but, unsurprisingly, it is Clint Eastwood who secures the lead role. And once again, the veteran shows us all the charisma he has. He really manages to balance his usual tough guy image with a fragility that his age accentuates and justifies. John Malkovich also did a good job. It's not the best of his career, but it was honest, credible and done with great professionalism. Rene Russo is the female standout, but in a movie with so much testosterone, she has little to do other than appear tough enough to keep up with those men and be the love interest of one of them.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has several points of merit that deserve to be highlighted and analyzed. When I read a little about this film (I have this habit, to be able to understand certain details and clear up some doubts that arise when watching), I discovered that there was, on the part of the production, a concern with the details. To make things more credible, they even asked the Secret Service for advice. And whenever a film production takes into account the relevance of details to the verisimilitude of the film, we have a duty to commend such efforts. Cinematography is the dominant standard in films of the time, and the sets and costumes are also what was imagined. There are many well-executed action scenes, and some good special effects and visuals.

I completely get the angle the filmmakers were going for, I'm just not convinced they pull it off. It's fun to watch, but I never once felt a connection to root for Kevin Costner's Butch.\r\n\r\nThere are many a time where I was just like \"Huh?\". It shows a number of events that you can tell are supposed to make you connect to Butch, but I just couldn't - he is super unlikeable, like the very first thing we see him do 'on the outside' defines him and the whole film. They could've wrote him in so many different ways, to give him a positive reason for what he does.\r\n\r\nYet, despite that it is entertaining, I cannot deny. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it works as a film for sure, but given it tries (too hard?) to attempt thought-provoking and deeper meaning I think it falls over itself - logically, I couldn't get on board. As a popcorn flick, I'm all in.\r\n\r\nP.S. How amusing to see the <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/casper/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Casper</a>'</em> connection, given the directing/acting Clint Eastwood would later make a cameo in the live-action film almost two years after this was released."], [], [], ["Globetrotting pursuit of a master-of-disguise assassin\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1997 and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, \"The Jackal\u201d is an international crime thriller about a joint FBI/MVD mission (led by Sidney Poitier and Diane Venora) that enlists the aid of an imprisoned IRA combatant (Richard Gere) to stop a brutal master-of-disguise assassin known as The Jackal (Bruce Willis) from completing a big hit in Washington DC. This was a loose remake of the film \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d (1973), which was based on the 1971 novel by Frederick Forsyth.\r\n\r\nThe first act is too convoluted for my tastes as the story globetrots from Moscow to Helsinki to Canada to the USA. But the movie finds its footing and settles into an entertaining political action flick not far removed from the tone of \u201cThe Saint\u201d with Val Kilmer, released the same year. Both films are from the same genre, have the same tone, were made for the same amount ($60 million), feature an antagonist who\u2019s a master-of-disguise and are named after that person. While both movies made roughly the same in North America ($55-60 million), \u201cThe Jackal\u201d proved more popular worldwide, making almost $160 million, which was $50 million more than \u201cThe Saint.\u201d IMHO \u201cThe Jackal\u201d is the more all-around entertaining picture.\r\n\r\nCritics love to lambaste this movie because (1.) it deviates too much from the original film and (2.) because of the mounting nonsensical elements. But (1.) \u201cThe Jackal\u201d was made to stand on its own in late 90\u2019s cinema and (2.) why do other action thrillers like James Bond get a pass when it comes to ridiculous plot holes? Besides, many of the supposed nonsensical moments can easily be cleared up if you pay attention to the details; not all of them, of course, but many of them.\r\n\r\nWhat I don\u2019t like is the disingenuousness of many of the criticisms. For instance, Roger Ebert\u2019s opening criticism of the film was to mock the way The Jackal sneaks into the USA from Canada by purchasing a sailboat and entering a race from Mackinaw to Chicago. Ebert reasoned that there are easier ways to enter the US inconspicuously along the 3000-mile border, but he left out an important detail: The Jackal was smuggling a huge computerized machine gun and its formidable mount. THAT is why he bought the yacht and used the race as a means to enter the country unnoticeably amidst a crowd of other crafts. Aduh.\r\n\r\nOne of the best aspects of this flick is the great cast and seeing them work together. Poitier was 69 during filming and looks very distinguished; this was incidentally his last theatrical release (although he appeared in four TV movies in the ensuing four years). Jack Black is effective in a peripheral role tailor-made for him.\r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s Gere and Willis who steal the show, naturally. The latter is particularly entertaining in an almost shocking departure from his typical easy-going, friendly persona. As The Jackal, Willis is relaxed, carefree, cold, malicious, cunning, calculating, smart, icy and ruthless; a charming psychopath.\r\n\r\nI shouldn't close without mentioning the excellent score by Carter Burwell mixed with an edgy alternative rock soundtrack, featuring cuts by Massive Attack (\"Superpredators\" and \"Dissolved Girl\") and the like.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hour, 4 minutes and was shot in Moscow, Finland, Montreal, London, the Carolinas, Virginia and Chicago.

Probably just lazy script writing.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some cool shots (in the days when they used helicopters for aerial shots compared to using drones) and the direction from Michael Caton-Jones was solid. **3.0/5**"], ["_**Twelve years in the Tibet area, 1939-1951**_\r\n\r\n\u201cSeven Years in Tibet\u201d (1997) is a biographical historical drama about Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) and his time in Tibet and friendship with the Dalai Lama, a boy, just before & during WW2, as well as the build-up to the invasion of Tibet in 1950 by Communist Chinese forces and the immediate aftermath. David Thewlis is on hand as Heinrich\u2019s German mountaineer friend.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s similar to other realistic walk-to-salvation wilderness adventures, like \u201cThe Way Back\u201d (2010). Pitt is charismatic as the pompous mountaineer who is slowly humbled in the highest region of the globe. The movie couldn\u2019t be made today since it paints the Chinese Communist Party in a negative light; in other words, it\u2019s truthful.          \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes and the bulk of it was shot in Argentina at the city of La Plata and the Andes Mountains in the Mendoza Province, while about 20 minutes of footage was secretly shot in Tibet. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "Brad Pitt is acclaimed Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer who leaves his expectant wife to climb in the Himalayas. A couple of high-altitude mishaps and the commencement of WWII see him and colleague Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis) interred by the British and confined to a POW camp. After a few failed attempts, the pair manage to escape and after some perilous trekking through the hostile wilderness, they find themselves at the gates of the holy city of Lhasa. Foreigners are not especially welcome here, but they are fed and watered and gradually become accepted to the point where Harrer is introduced to the Great Mother and thence to the young, curious and engaging Dalai Lama himself. The spiritual leader takes a shine to his new friend with golden hair and the older man regales him with tales of wonder from the outside world. Simultaneously, their much larger and increasingly more territorial neighbour has clear designs on Tibet. With troops massing on the borders, the precarious nature of the independence of this small country becomes more obvious and, well history is never far from the narrative. I think Pitt plays well as the arrogant climber and as the story develops so does his character - from a selfish loner to one who learns to care for things greater than just himself. To that end, Thewlis also delivers strongly as the pair bond - despite themselves, sometimes - and \"Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk positively oozes a decency and spiritualism as the boy who is fighting a losing battle against those who think religion is a \"disease\". Though it does rather oversimplify the politics, this film is beautifully shot with some genuine Tibetan scenes around the amazing architecture that is the Potala Palace and by the denouement you can't help but empathise with a nation that just wanted to be left in peace to live in peace."], ["This review is of the Director's Cut.\r\n\r\nWelcome To Shell Beach. \r\n\r\nDark City is directed by Alex Proyas who also co-writes the screenplay with Leon Dobbs and David S. Goyer. It stars Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly, Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien and Ian Richardson. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. \r\n\r\nA man wakes up in a grotty hotel bathroom and upon finding a dead girl in another room he realises he has no recollection of who he is or how he got there... \r\n\r\nThere's a lot of Blade Runner fans still out there waiting for that film's sexual partner to happen along. What many of them don't realise is that Alex Proyas has already made that movie. More than a cult film yet still criminally ignored in certain circles, Dark City, by way of poor box office and studio interference, never got off to the best of starts. The problems were compounded with the release of The Matrix the following year, where that film's popularity, and its sci-fi linkage to Dark City, led many to think that Proyas' movie was a Matrix rip-off; pushing it further (unjustly) back in the sci-fi noir pantheon. Fact is is that Dark City homages much great cinema from previous years, but it has influenced much that followed, with Inception fans asked to note that Nolan himself was taking notes... \r\n\r\nStolen Memories. \r\n\r\nDark City is a feverish film noir dressed up in stunning sci-fi clothes. The amazing visuals have led many to state that it's a film with much style and little substance, something which Proyas has fiercely argued against; and he's right to do so, especially once his own preferred director's cut became available to view. The story is a complex one, pulsing with human characters living in a world where there is no daylight, with their respective memories scratchy to say the least, it quickly becomes evident that a creepy alien race are overseeing things. The aliens, wonderfully attired in black trench-coats and hats to match, and aided by Kiefer Sutherland's shifty - stammer affected - doctor, have special powers and their reasons for being here unfold in deftly constructed stages. One man stands in their way, John Murdoch (Sewell), but he is an olde noir amnesia sufferer supreme and his battle to unravel what is going on is our task as well. \r\n\r\nDo you think about the past much Mrs. Murdoch? \r\n\r\nThe search for identity and the truth is what propels the picture forward. Murdoch in his confused state is not only at the center of an existential dilemma, he's also the focal point for a serial killer murder investigation. This also as he tries to come to terms with matters of the heart, it seems he has a beautiful wife (Connelly), and that she may have cheated on him? And why is he drawn to the place known as Shell Beach? A simple narrative hidden by visual splendours? Don't make me laugh! But hell you have to say the visual look and atmosphere of the design is very much attention grabbing. \r\n\r\nI have become the monster you were intended to be. \r\n\r\nWith the film noir characters in place; Hurt's dour sleuth, Sewell's amnesiac and Connelly's sultry torch singer, Proyas brings German expressionism in abundance whilst overseeing an eye splintering neo-noir colour palette. Greens and reds often ping from the screen, while the murky browns and golds down on the angular city streets pave the way for changed perceptions and revelations of plotting. There are reoccurring motifs throughout, with swirls and circles integral to mood and meanings, while at the mid-point we then get to see Proyas' tricks of the trade, where the city shifts and moves to create a meeting of Metropolis and Gotham, all as the humans slumber away. Watch those clocks folks... \r\n\r\nYou know how I was supposed to feel. That person isn't me... never was. You wanted to know what it was about us that made us human. Well, you're not going to find it... \r\n\r\nActing performances are hardly top of the line (Sutherland especially irritates more than he impresses), but they actually don't need to be, and they all look terrific in their respective dressage. The story is of course bonkers and one which I myself found was much better whilst consuming mucho alcohol! (I watched it three times in 48 hours!) While Proyas himself is on record as saying it's a far from flawless picture. Again he is right, but he also knows that his film is still under valued and in need of more to seek out his director's cut. The late Roger Ebert championed Dark City with much gusto, and he provides very good input on the DVD, much like Roger I have to say, this is a unique and fabulous sci-fi noir experience. A film in fact fit to watch alongside Blade Runner; And I do not say that lightly. 9/10", "**_Atmospheric, dark mixture of film noir, comic book horror and sci-fi_** \r\n\r\nA man (Rufus Sewell) wakes up one night to great mysteries: There's a dead prostitute nearby that he gets blamed for murdering, but he can't remember much of anything. Several people seek him in the ensuing night hours of the big city: a somewhat mad doctor (Kiefer Sutherland), a detective (William Hurt), his estranged wife (Jennifer Connelly), an alluring woman of the night (Melissa George) and a group of pale bald males in black trench coats. He tries to piece together reality and escape the perpetually dark city.\r\n\r\nAlex Proyas' \"Dark City\" (1998) takes place entirely on elaborate shadowy sets with CGI backgrounds, etc. The first time I tried to watch it I gave up after 20 minutes. But, if you're in the right mode, it's a cool sci-fi flick with elements of film noir and mystery/horror that is thought-provoking and never devolves into predictable blockbuster dreck.\r\n\r\nThe revelations at the end are well done. In addition, Sewell makes for a top-rate protagonist and William Hurt is effective. Many complain about Kiefer's offbeat performance, but the role called for it. If you don't like it blame the writers.\r\n\r\nOn the female front you have Jennifer Connelly when she was still curvy and ravishing (by the early 2000s she lost too much weight and thus her alluring appeal). Meanwhile Melissa George is gorgeous in her small role as a call girl.\r\n\r\nMy interest in \"Dark City\" was spurred by Roger Ebert's exuberant accolades. He was so impressed by the illusion of the vast scope of the city, which can be attributed to the well-done CGI backgrounds and accouterments beyond the immediate exemplary sets. Of course, this is no big deal today, but at the time it was still fairly new technology.\r\n\r\nSome people compare \"Dark City\" to the more popular \"The Matrix\" and for good reason since they have similar themes and \"The Matrix\" was actually shot on some of the same sets, but that one came out over a year later in 1999. There are also similarities to \"Gattaca,\" which debuted 4.5 months earlier in late 1997.\r\n\r\n\"The Matrix\" went on to mega-success at the box office while \"Dark City\" floundered despite its brilliant bits. Why? For me, the characters needed fleshed-out more with increased human interest. There's some, for sure, but not enough. As such, audiences in general found the film odd, perplexing and uncompelling. However, sci-fi aficionados should eat it up.\r\n\r\nIt's superior to \"Gattaca,\" but not as as good as \"The Matrix.\"\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and the Director's Cut 1 minute longer; it was shot on sets in Sydney, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/B"], [], ["Sharon Stone and Robert De Niro were amazing!

It is not the best version in my opinion, but it was well worth watching. Like most British productions of this sort, it depends upon a talented ensemble cast rather than a few superstars as top billing.\r\n\r\nIt has also been a long time since I have read Jane Austen\u2019s that this movie is based upon, and after seeing how this and two other versions stray from each other\u2019s, in small ways that is, I would be curious to know how often each one remains true to the original.

I had always wondered why this film had bombed so miserably, and now I know why. In cases like this, more should have been done to alter the story arc, just some basic tweaks, to make it more suspenseful and/or (though I usually balk at such 'Hollywood' tendencies) some romantic tension (a beauty such as Fonda's was misused--they may as well have hired someone else).

There's talent in her direction but Gerwig instead of looking for a challenge having the doors as open as she has them at the moment, she sat in the conformism and made a film that feels totally built as a ''For Your Consideration '' And be afraid if she's not considered.\r\n\r\nI don't deny that Gerwig loves the novel, she shows it and certainly this version is her personal vision but despite the nice attempt, there's nothing new or fresh in her take.\r\nI have to admit and emphasize that at this point it's completely stupid and naive to ask for a radical change in a story which has already been told a lot of times in film, however, it also cannot help feeling like a cheap mean of exploiting the story considering our current times, where feminism is now a driving force in the industry.\r\nLike I said, she went for the safe bet. \r\n\r\nAnd yet despite Gerwig's attempt to increase that specific plot weight, she also avoids going to issues that wouldn't work for the story she was trying to tell, because although they're not girls with money, they have the privilege of being protected from the civil war. \r\n\r\nJo is a young woman aware of herself and her mind, which in those times wasn't something positive but obviously the external world is not a concern for her, only her personal interests. And that's ok, we get to be that way, especially when we're young, but how do you try to make woke characters, if it's only in the things that suits them?\r\nThat's where the pertinent questions should be asked about what it was decided to take in order to make this new version work according to the director's perspective.\r\n\r\nIn the end, despite the production quality, Little Women is just a conventional and ordinary repetition of a literary classic that I personally think has already been too used.\r\nBut the proposal works both to be loved and to be hated and that depends a lot on the mentality you carry with you when you go to see it.\r\nAs always the rest depends on what you get from the film.", "Guess 2019's just the year for Florence Pugh to be in critically acclaimed and letterboxd beloved movies that I just genuinely didn't care for much.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nThe 92nd Academy Awards are presented this Sunday, and Little Women is part of the few 2019 releases that are only now (2020) being shown in my country. I really want to watch every Best Picture nominee before the ceremony not only to provide my honest predictions but also to have a Top10: Best Movies of 2019 more complete regarding the number of films watched. Well, Greta Gerwig's adaptation of the famous book isn't able to crack a spot in my Top10, but it's definitely worth an honorable mention.\r\n\r\nThere's been a lot of controversy surrounding the Best Director category, way beyond just the Oscars. The lack of a female nominee across a few award shows raised some discontent, and most considered Gerwig's work to be more than enough to warrant more nominations, especially at the Academy Awards. Now, I'm going to be as polite, respectful, and fair as I can. While I do agree that Gerwig does a great job in directing this movie, I still believe that the five male directors nominated for the respective Oscar did an even better one. Even removing Todd Phillips (Joker) out of the equation (which I entirely accept), I would definitely choose Noah Baumbach (Marriage Story) as his replacement.\r\n\r\nWith that said, do I suddenly become a misogynist? Do I always favor men when I send my own ballots to the OFTA Awards, for example? I don't think so. It's just a humble opinion. Putting that discussion aside, let's focus on the positive aspects of Little Women because there are many! Usually, romance isn't a genre I tend to love, but I really enjoyed this adaptation of Alcott's famous novel. I'll start with the cast because how can't I?\r\n\r\nWith such a stellar team of actors, I knew I was going to receive some amazing performances. Every character gets a lot of screentime, but Saoirse Ronan is definitely the lead as Jo. She's the odd sister, the one that doesn't really want to follow the \"rules\" of being a woman in the XIX century. She wants to do what she loves for a living and be independent without having to be this housewife that simply married a rich man. She wants to be remembered. Saoirse incorporates this personality like it's her own, and adds another brilliant display to her acting career.\r\n\r\nHowever, Florence Pugh gives the standout performance as Amy. Undoubtedly, Pugh is the breakthrough actress of this last year. Fantastic physical display in Fighting with my Family, one of the best performances of 2019 in Midsommar, and the most complex role of her career in Little Women. Since the story is continuously going back and forward in time, everyone has to portray two versions of the same character, but Amy is the one that changes the most. As a childish, immature, silly, young Amy, Pugh delivers some of the funniest moments of the film. Truly hilarious at some points. Then, as an adult Amy, she's more grounded, responsible, and about to follow one of the \"rules\" of society regarding women: marrying a rich man.\r\n\r\nEliza Scanlen carries an emotional arc as Beth, and the best past-present sequence is due to her. Emma Watson is Meg, the older sister who everyone looks up to since she seems to be perfect, so her arc goes through some demonstrations of how her imperfections make her a role model to her sisters. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is also one of the standouts as Laurie, a neighbor who gets close to the March family, but I won't delve into too many details regarding his story. Laura Dern (Marmee March) and Meryl Streep (Aunt March) are perfect as always. Every character arc is exceptionally developed. With a runtime slightly over two hours, it's remarkable the level of detail, complexity, and depth that the characters possess.\r\n\r\nI can't address every single one in detail since there are so many, but I tried my best to give an overview of each of the main ones. Clearly, Jo, Laurie, and Amy's arcs are the absolute best. However, Emma Watson's character story is the one that feels too superficial and too simple compared with her sisters'. It doesn't really feel like she went through any change throughout the years, and part of her story feels a bit forced. Beth's arc might also be straightforward, but since it's associated with an emotionally powerful plot point, one can understand her little screentime.\r\n\r\nThe past-present storytelling method works for the most part. There are a couple of moments beautifully and seamlessly \"stitched\" together, giving the viewer a sense of fulfillment by witnessing the start and end of a little story that happened in the past and later in the present under other circumstances. Nevertheless, some sequences either drag too much or lack emotional investment. Since the movie crosses the two-hour mark, I found myself bored during certain storylines that failed to captivate me.\r\n\r\nIn a film with so many characters, it's very common to give more focus to only a few of them. It's impossible to call someone a protagonist if half a dozen characters have the same or more screentime or plot relevance. However, this always brings the issue of not being able to fascinate the audience with every character arc. Also, some past-present transitions are so abrupt that they disrupt the overall pacing by being a bit confusing. Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig does an excellent job in balancing these timelines, and an even better one by opposing the contrasting tones of each period and still make them consistent.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Yorick Le Saux offers gorgeous cinematography, Alexandre Desplat provides a subtle yet efficient score, but the costume design steals the show by being extremely period-accurate. The colors of the whole movie tell a story on their own, as well as the set design, so be sure to look around on each wide shot because there is much to see behind the actors.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Little Women doesn't do enough to warrant a spot in my 2019's Top10, but Greta Gerwig's adaptation of the classic graphic novel deserves all of the screenplay awards it has been receiving so far. As expected, the whole cast is phenomenal, but Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet not only deliver the best performances of the film, but their characters carry the most compelling arcs. With so many people, it's remarkable the level of detail, complexity, and depth that each character has. However, some storylines are not as captivating as others, and the pacing suffers from these less exciting stories, which bring the movie down for some moments. The past-present transitions are mostly well-handled but a few are too confusing and abrupt. The contrasting tones of each timeline are consistent throughout the runtime, and the costume design steals the \"technical spotlight\". Overall, it's a pretty good romance, so if you enjoy the genre, I can't see why you shouldn't enjoy this one.\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "Full review: <a>https://www.tinakakadelis.com/beyond-the-cinerama-dome/2021/12/28/great-or-nothing-little-women-2019-review<a>\r\n\r\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s timeless novel, _Little Women_, feels like coming home. It\u2019s the sort of movie that surrounds the audience with feelings of warmth and comfort. This feeling comes from the coziness of the cabin the March family resides in, the love that exudes from the performances, and the treatment of the source material, which was clearly a formative book for Gerwig. She approaches this retelling with a few small updates and a great reverence for the original.", "It's Little Women... with \"modern sensibilities\" and that should be enough of a warning... which is odd given that the novel, and even the 1994 movie both had feminist ideals.  But then they weren't made for \"modern audiences,\" so they have more of a focus on characters and story than pushing \"The Message.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that was the issue here, yet again \"THE MESSAGE\" was the most important part of the movie, and to make sure you understood that the characters were, well caricatured, some of them reduced even further to nothing but cliches.\r\n\r\nThe plot was... rushed.  It seemed to want to jump from message to message rather than tell a cohesive narrative and because of that one of the saddest parts of the novel was almost laughable, almost comedic in this version, most like because it really didn't fit with The Message and needed to be rushed.\r\n\r\nAnd the same thing happened with the dialogue, it was rushed, clipped, and meaningless unless pushing, you guessed it, The Message.\r\n\r\nThe result was that there is little in the way of character development, you can't really get attached to anyone, they have little personality compared to the other adaptations and the source material, but then you get the feeling that this version wasn't about the sisters, it was about the politics that appeal to the \"Modern Audience.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that is a shame, because the modern reader still picks up Little Women and loves it because of the March sisters and not because of \"Modern Sensibilities.\"  But, hey, kudos for not race swapping."], [], [], ["\u201cDo you know what Dr. Johnson said? Guests, like the fish, start to stink on the third day.\u201d \r\n\u201cIn fact, I think you'll find that I start to stink on the first day.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis exchange exemplifies the good and the bad about Barcelona; it\u2019s full of acerbic Johnsonian sarcasm beautifully channeled by Chris Eigeman, but the third act feels more like the third day, with all that this implies.\r\n\r\nThe film, about two young American cousins \u200b\u200band their misadventures with the female fauna of the titular city, has another problem. The cousins, Fred and Ted, are skillfully and competently played by Eigeman and Taylor Nichols, respectively \u2014 Nichols's forced verbal tics only manage to make him seem like an ersatz Woody Allen (unusual for for writer/director Whit Stillman, who tends to evoke favorable comparisons to the legendary filmmaker), although he makes up for this with a scene described by Fred as \u201csome weird religious ceremony based on Glenn Miller\u201d \u2014 but the Barcelonans they get involved with are played by Australian, English, or American actresses; this is particularly jarring when it comes to the character played by Mira Sorvino, who is neither Spanish nor has the acting ability to pass for one.\r\n\r\nApplying the Italian neorealist approach, literally any randomly selected passerby on a Barcelona sidewalk would have done a better job; on the other hand, it\u2019s possible that my complaint is irrelevant, especially considering that the females in the story are practically interchangeable. \r\n\r\nEven though he spends most of his time courting Marta (Sorvino), Fred ends up falling in love with Montserrat (Tushka Bergen); according to him, \u201cI've seen her in all sorts of different situations and contexts\u201d \u2014 situations and contexts that must have occurred in scenes written but not shot, or shot but ultimately cut (the script simply shrugs it off, mentioning towards the end that \u201cWe spend hours together on the phone, and she is so fascinating and charming\u201d). Meanwhile, Ted ends up marrying Greta (Hellena Schmied), a late addition to the plot with whom Ted doesn't share much more quality time than Fred does with Montserrat.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps this is precisely the point; as Ted says, \u201cyou see a beautiful girl and immediately you\u2019re subject to all these emotions \u2026 you haven't even talked to the girl, and you already want to get married and spend the rest of your life with her\u201d. \r\n\r\nHe suffers from \"a real 'romantic illusion' problem,\" and yearns, \"instead of a fantasy built on the pretty slope of an eyebrow or the curve of an upper lip, to see the real person. Maybe even look into her eyes and see her soul.\" \r\n\r\nIn that sense, the film is a true reflection of, as Roger Ebert put it in his review, \"a vast yearning which can only be filled by a girl\" that most of us experience before we reach the age of reason; sadly, Fred doesn\u2019t seem to outgrow this juvenile yearning during the course of the film, and there is no indication that his relationship with Greta is less based on ciliary sloping and/or lip curvature than on the \"real person.\""], [], [], ["Just a masterpiece mixing an interesting background story, great script with good humor, exceptional singers and dancers and a Gene Kelly that is just genial, well sided with Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds.\r\n\r\nA must to be seen.", "I'm happy again!\r\n\r\nSinging In The Rain is to me the greatest musical ever made, sure many others push it close, The Wizard Of Oz for one will always be a 10/10 movie in my opinion, but Singing In The Rain is a film that has no flaws, it is a perfect movie.\r\n\r\nDon Lockwood is a star of silent movies but his life is boring, then talking movies arrive and with them he eyes an opportunity to greatly improve his life. A chance encounter with dancer Kathy Selden will further shape his destiny, and along with best pal and partner Cosmo Brown, their respective fortunes will hopefully dovetail towards fulfillment.\r\n\r\nWhere do you start? The film is a homage to happiness, be it film making or love, or friendships and honour, the film is pure and simply joyous from the first reel to the triumphant last shot. Featuring stunning choreography, Singing In The Rain doesn't cop out by merely having characters plodding thru a script and then bursting into song occasionally, each song furthers the characters and fleshes out the story unfolding to keep the plot lines tight and crucially, important.\r\n\r\nMake 'Em Laugh, Good Morning, and Singing In The Rain are just some of the brilliant songs and dance routines on show here, with the latter a now legendary piece of cinematic history that speaks volumes for the joyous nature of the film, whilst the finale sequence of the 'Broadway Ballet' is magic & elegance personified. The cast are uniformly excellent, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor & Debbie Reynolds interplay together like they were hatched from the same egg, and the joint direction from Stanley Donen (along with Kelly) is seamless.\r\n\r\nFull of hat tipping and self-referencing winks, Singing In The Rain regularly hits the top ten lists of critics and movie fans alike, so lets not beat around the bush about it...it flipping well deserves it. 10/10 in every respect.", "I'm clearly in the major, major minority. Honestly though, I didn't enjoy this.\r\n\r\nIt's certainly worth noting musicals are probably my least favourite genre, but I'm still more than capable of finding entertainment with them - e.g. <em>'The Greatest Showman'</em>, <em>'The Sound of Music'</em> and others.\r\n\r\n<em>'Singin\u2019 in the Rain'</em>, however, simply didn't connect with me. There's one, maybe two, good songs that I had already heard, while Gene Kelly (Don) is solid fun in the lead role. The premise, minus the music, is actually very interesting, what with the silent film transition era. Given it's a musical, though, they don't delve as deep into that as I wanted.\r\n\r\nNone of the songs, aside from the previously alluded to \"Singin' in the Rain\", landed well with me, I kinda found them a chore to sit through to be frank. Elsewhere on the cast, aside from Kelly, I found Debbie Reynolds (Kathy) alright but Donald O'Connor (Cosmo) a little irritating - he tries too hard, for my liking. Jean Hagen (Lina) is likewise a tad annoying, though that's intentional with her to be fair.\r\n\r\nI will acknowledge that the film, aesthetically, looks excellent. I wish I liked it more overall, but I just didn't. Do feel free to ignore me!", "There's a tendency with this film to just think of the genius that was Gene Kelly and his umbrella with the title song, but as a wonderfully enjoyable three hander between himself, Debbie Reynolds and my own favourite from this film Donald O'Connor, it is so much more the that. It just oozes charm and style. The plot centres around the aspirations of a silent movie company to make a talkie! Their long established stars \"Don Lockwood\" (Kelly) and \"Lina Lamont\" (Jean Hagan) have a successful on-screen (and in-press) persona as the dream couple - in reality they can barely stomach each other - but they must embrace progress and with the arrival of the sound equipment and new ideas man \"Cosmo\" (O'Connor) the challenge is on to make a smash hit. Anyone who's seen any silent movies will know that not everyone successful in that medium had the, shall we say - attributes - to make a go of this, and soon we have a bit of a battle going on between Hagan and Kelly's actual gal in this movie \"Kathy\" (Reynolds) for the big part! The settings allow the costumier to have a field day, and the three are very much in their elements trying out all these would-be scenarios from the creative head of \"Cosmo\". Songs? Well, where do you start? Betty Comden and Adolph Green hit a real purple patch with his - they trawled through musicals from the twenties and thirties and present us with the likes of \"You Were Meant For Me\", \"Make 'em Laugh\" and \"Good Morning\" as well as the theme song that get our feet a-tapping and our smiles a-raising. Reynolds' singing voice came courtesy of Betty Noyes, but the dubbing is perfect and it matters not a jot that she isn't actually singing. There is plenty of light-heartedness (and a healthy dose of jealous back-biting too!) and the dancing isn't perfect, which helps lots too. For much of the time, the routines look and feel natural, like pals making it up as they go along and having fun in the process. A lavish looking production and a wee bit of Cyd Charisse and Rita Moreno too - what more could you ask for...?"], [], ["I have always been a sucker for a good chick flick.

This is worse than a watered down romance novel. The story was very boring and uninspired. I personally find all the actors/actresses unattractive and there is no chemistry.

It's as if <em>'Dirty Dancing'</em> and <em>'Blades of Glory'</em> had a baby. The comedic parts work better than the more romantic parts, but all in all it's an enjoyable watch - even for someone who holds no interest in dance. It's also extremely predictable, but that doesn't trouble the film one bit.\r\n\r\nDebutants, like Luhrmann himself, Paul Mercurio (Scott) and Tara Morice (Fran) work well together, with Bill Hunter being the standout support; though he doesn't top his performance in 2003 classic <em>'Kangaroo Jack'</em>. Sorry not sorry.", "Rarely can one movie be credited with resurrecting an entire genre of programming, but this one certainly reinvigorated media - and participatory - interest in the reputationally staid pursuit of ballroom dancing. The young, accomplished and handsome \"Scott\" (Paul Mercurio) is determined to get to the top and to do it his way. He is not content to stick with the status quo as defined by the ageing committee led by the buffoon that is \"Barry Fife\" (Bill Hunter). His parents are sceptical, but when he alights on \"Fran\" (Tara Morice) then the championships are in their sights and the rules are there to be broken. Baz Luhrmann allows the cast and the dancing to do the work here. The dialogue is earthy, and witty at times but for the most part there is plenty of dancing that illustrates well the tough regimen of discipline required to perform at the highest levels in what is generally considered a rather sedate pastime. There are strong supporting characters a-plenty - not least his mother \"Shirley\" (Pat Thomson) and rather shrinking violet father \"Doug\" (Barry Otto) to complement the really rather excellent Hunter (and his toup\u00e9). It packs loads into ninety minutes and uses a fine soundtrack to help keep the whole thing moving along entertainingly.", "**A film that remains fresh and enjoyable, even if the plot suffers from irritating clich\u00e9s and other problems.**\r\n\r\nDance is one of those arts that is occasionally portrayed in cinema, and this film is reasonably similar to others that focus on ballroom dancing and major dance competitions (I'm thinking of the most obvious example, \u201cShall We Dance\u201d, but there are others). Directed by Baz Luhrmann, it is one of the least acclaimed films of this director's career, but the fact that it went unnoticed does not take away from its qualities: it is undoubtedly a good film to watch and the story it tells us is still fresh.\r\n\r\nIt's not worth summarizing the plot, which centers on a young adult, under intense pressure to win an important dance prize, and the relationship he establishes with his newly discovered dance partner who quickly becomes his girlfriend. However, this young man wants to dance without feeling tied to the meticulous execution of already established steps and choreographies. This displeases the president of the Australian Dance Federation, who sees this creativity as a rebellious act against the codes of ballroom dancing. The film is a very effective romantic comedy, with very witty and engaging moments that work wonderfully well. The energy and joy that emanates is contagious and makes the pace faster, but the romantic plot is clich\u00e9 and leaves the film predictable to the point of absurdity.\r\n\r\nIf the script has its weaknesses, this is largely compensated by the well-structured and remarkable work of the actors: let's forget the fact that even the glasses of Fran, Tara Morice's character, are an old soap opera's clich\u00e9, and see the work that she develops: although it is not an award-worthy effort, it is undoubtedly positive. Paul Mercurio, the main actor, is sullen and even rude towards his partner and other people. We also can't ignore that he doesn't have any kind of charisma (maybe that's why this actor wasn't successful), but he establishes a very good working relationship with Morice, and they develop harmoniously together. The secondary actors had better luck with the characters: Bill Hunter has the right to a very interesting character, with grotesque but well-crafted nuances, and Pat Thomson also did a well-done job.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film stands out not only for the excellence of its soundtrack, where I would like to highlight the version of \u201cTime After Time\u201d (a classic that never leaves the ears of those who lived through the 80s and 90s), but also for the good quality of the sets, costumes and props used. I don't know if the film had a very high budget, but it can be seen that there was a strong and consistent investment in these elements, particularly in the construction of the spaces and the design of the dresses and dance costumes used in the competition scenes."], ["**A stupid teen comedy, but still funny enough.**\r\n\r\nTeenage films are not exactly my \u201ccup of tea\u201d, but I confess that this little comic film pleased me: after being abandoned by his girlfriend who, deep down, didn't like him and was just trying to be the girlfriend of the most popular boy in the neighborhood, a young man decides to die. After some half-hearted and half-hearted attempts, he ends up turning the situation around in a surprising way.\r\n\r\nIt's a film that has the advantage of being funny, although it's still as stupid as any other teen film. They treat that snowy hill as if it were a Himalayan peak \u2013 they even gave it a name alluding to a real mountain in this range \u2013 and good skiing seems to be an obsession for the locals.

We also have a bizarre and disgusting family that lives close to the protagonist and that I wouldn't want near my house: besides looking like a beautiful group of idiots, I don't know if those people take baths. There are still some additional oddities, but I won't say much about them... it's better to see.\r\n\r\nJohn Cusack did a good job.

I liked \"Rob Roy\" better than \"Braveheart;\" it's very adult-oriented, violent, gritty and grim, however.\r\n\r\n\"First Knight\" is a believable take on the King Arthur/Camelot legend starring Sean Connery as Arthur, Richard Gere as Lancelot and Julia Ormond as Guinevere. They get tangled up in a bit of a love triangle. Ben Cross plays the villain, ex-knight Malagant. \r\n\r\nBeing a relatively realistic portrayal of the folkloric story, the tone is similar to \u201cRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves\u201d (1991), but without the witch and the campy Alan Rickman. So don\u2019t expect any of that silly magical jive with Merlin, Excalibur, etc. This might explain why so many pan the film, but I don't get their beef. Aren't there enough cinematic depictions of the Camelot tale with supernatural elements for them to enjoy, like 1981\u2019s \"Excalibur\"? I'll put it this way, \"First Knight\" is to the Arthur/Lancelot legend what the film \"Troy\" (2004) is to the Helen of Troy chronicle, although \u201cFirst Knight\u201d is less gritty.\r\n\r\nThe film caught my fascination right away with the character of Lancelot. He is portrayed as an expert swordsman, drifter, loner and all-around lost soul. The beginning reveals something integral to understanding his character: Lancelot takes on an intimidating dude in a swordfight contest at a village he\u2019s traveling through. After Lancelot prevails, the big guy asks him for advice on how to be as skilled a swordsman. Lancelot tells him that he needs a couple of obvious sword-fighting skills, to which the man confidently replies, \"I can do that.\" Then Lancelot tells him the last quality he needs: \"And you have to not care whether you live or die.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a powerful scene; Gere plays the character very convincingly (in fact, if you hate Gere, this film might give you a new-found respect for him). This character-defining episode reveals HOW Lancelot is the only one able to prevail against an incredible and decidedly deadly weapons gauntlet later in the story, which is a highlight.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the film is just a solid medieval/British Isle adventure with a noble folkloric tone, requisite forest scenes and all. What I mean by \u201cfolkloric\u201d can be seen in Lancelot\u2019s heroic rescue of Guinevere in Malagant's cave fortress, which is pretty implausible. But these are larger-than-life figures, right?\r\n\r\n\"First Knight\" more than satisfied my hunger for a medieval/British isles flick and surprised me with the intriguing character of the suicidally-brave Lancelot. If one doesn't have hang-ups regarding the absence of Merlin, Excalibur and the magical baggage that goes with 'em, this is an entertaining and classy heroic film.\r\n\r\nOn top of all this, the movie features a fascinating allegorical subtext: King Arthur is God, Camelot is Heaven, Malagant is the fallen Lucifer, his dark, cavernous \u2018castle\u2019 is the Underworld, Guinevere represents humanity caught in the epic fight between good (Arthur) and evil (Malagant), and Lancelot represents worldly temptation.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Wales & England. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B", "OK. First things first; this deviates substantially from any of the other depictions of Arthurian legend, so if you're looking for anything akin to the films (or books) you've come across before, then I'd stop now. If you're looking for a light and fluffy costume romance, then you might salvage something from it yet, though. Julia Ormond (Guinevere) is travelling to meet Sean Connery (King Arthur) with a view to marrying him and thus saving her beleaguered land of Leonesse from the frequent invasions of the evil \"Malagant\" (Ben Cross). On her way, though, she is attacked and only saved by the cunning wit and bravery of travelling swordsman Lancelot (Richard Gere). She is delivered safely to her beau, only to encounter Lancelot again as he wins the most lethal obstacle course known to man - and he gets his kiss! The remainder of the film dips in and out of the legend - she falls in love; gets kidnapped and there are as many shades of \"Robin Hood\" as there are of \"Knights of the Round Table\" as our intrepid Lancelot tries to keep her, and the kingdom safe. Cross isn't exactly menacing as the baddie, but Connery is quite good giving an impression of a king who can't believe his luck, and Ormond and Gere have a certain chemistry as their affair blossoms. The ending isn't up to much, though - perhaps if the knights had spent less time in front of the mirror, they may have made for better soldiers - and I thought the whole thing missed the characterisation of Merlin (the most interesting character of these legends, I thought). The look of the film is mischievous, colourful and breezy, and it's a decent if slightly cheesy and unremarkable family film that does what it says on the tin.", "**I really like this movie, but it's a terrible movie.**\r\n\r\nThis film is, for me, particularly nostalgic because I really enjoyed watching it in my childhood and youth. It was one of those films that marked my imagination about the Middle Ages, and how it could have been. Obviously, the way I see it has changed with maturity, and studies have allowed me to perceive the enormous anachronisms committed by this film, on several levels. However, like almost everything that brings us good childhood memories, it is a film that continues to be very dear to me.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay does not deserve much consideration, being essentially a poor melodrama of questionable taste, created around the Arthurian legends. The legend, as we know, has a strong Frankish origin, and centers on a legendary king who ruled over Britannia, defending it from the Saxons, in a very early period of the High Middle Ages \u2013 yes, because the Middle Ages cannot be considered as a whole, it is practically a thousand years long and a lot has happened in that time. We see a Lady Guinevere enter into a marriage of political convenience with an aging King Arthur, at the height of his power and influence, even though threatened by the host of an enemy, Malagant. And we see how an arrogant young Lancelot pursues, and in effect harasses, the young queen, seducing her and causing her to fall in love with him.\r\n\r\nDespite the affection I have for this film, which brings me so many good memories, I recognize that it is a weak and poorly made film. The story itself that is told to us is quite ugly, being, in essence, a moral tale of seduction, betrayal, adultery and abuse of trust, where the only character worthy of our sympathy is old King Arthur, in his excess of goodness, sense of justice and righteousness. Even though he is an old man, he honors his word to his bride's father and marries her (obviously a woman much younger than he is) to protect her and her feudal lordship. Committed to building an ideal kingdom, he ostracizes Malagant, who disbelieves in the project due to his own ambition and cruelty, just as he cannot see how he opens himself up to Lancelot, a total stranger, creating conditions for Lancelot to abuse him and betray him, seducing the young and ungrateful queen. A very ugly story, but one of strong humanity, where we learn what happens when we are too good.\r\n\r\nDespite only appearing to us almost half an hour after the film has started, there is no doubt that Sean Connery is the great actor in this film. He was just the man to bestow strength and nobility on the old British sovereign. Moreover, his charismatic and aristocratic presence, and the impeccable way in which he acts and works his character, is reason enough to justify a revisit to this film, which has become quite popular on television. However, the rest of the cast is totally wrong. Either the actors weren't able to understand the characters, or (and I bet that was it) director Jerry Zucker was totally incapable of directing them and understanding how he should do it. Julia Ormond is very beautiful and elegant, but she doesn't seem to know what she's doing in this movie. Ben Cross is a shadow of himself and makes for an absurdly poorly written and poorly conceived character. Richard Gere is pompous, smug, braggart, irritating and perverse.\r\n\r\nProduction values \u200b\u200bare high, and the film looks expensive. The cinematography is incredible and very beautiful, especially the night scenes, with torchlight and fire. The sets and costumes are very detailed, elaborate and visually impressive. The weapons and armor of Arthur's knights, with the blue and silver, are beautiful, and Camelot is one of the most beautiful medieval scenic cities I've ever seen in a movie. The big problem with this is that we are seeing a blatant anachrony! If the film addresses the figure of King Arthur and that king existed sometime before the Year A Thousand, the city of Camelot would never have that elaborate visual aspect. Weapons and armor, likewise, would be much more primitive, simple and functional. It's all very nice, no doubt about it, but it's fake like the kiss of Judas! One more word for the soundtrack, which is a bit vulgar and dubious in taste, almost melodramatic.", "Yeah, this is pretty bad.\r\n\r\nI saw one reviewer call the armor Arthur's side wears \"something that comes out of Star Trek\" and another call the bad guy's armor \"leather ala Road Warrior,\" and both are fairly accurate descriptions. Nothing really look period, it all looks a lot more sci-fi then medieval.\r\n\r\nAnd the casting too seems wrong, Gere was too old, and the age difference between Connery and Ormond was a little too vast be really believable in the context of the legends it's based on. Not to mention that Gere is a little too American.\r\n\r\nAnd then, moving on, there is a gauntlet that came straight out of American Ninja Warrior... or more apt for the time, American Gladiators, either way it did a great job of sucking even more believablity out of the film to the point where it really wouldn't shock you if you saw a robot or two and a couple of blasters.\r\n\r\nIt didn't look right, it didn't feel right, and I guess, at some level, it might work as a romance... except it also lacked charisma so I'm not sure how appealing it is there either.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of King Arthur if the legends personified everything bad about 1990s movies."], ["Only the second time seeing this (last was probably in the early 2000s on DVD) and thought it was okay but guess like others, this has grown on me. Laughed throughout even when the dialogue wasn't the greatest, but I have an appreciation for sarcasm so I gravitated towards Jason Lee's character the most. Not quite sure it's on the level of Clerks or Chasing Amy (have to re-visit those) but a solid comedy. **3.75/5**", "**A comedy full of absurd jokes, which could work better if they weren't so aimed at niche audiences that most people don't really belong to.**\r\n\r\nFrom the same hand that gave us \u201cClerks\u201d (director and screenwriter Kevin Smith) came this bizarre comedy, centered on two teenagers who have just lost their girlfriends. It is already known that we are going to see a film that is, to say the least, unorthodox and full of light-hearted jokes, allusions to pop culture and elements that would be easy to identify for the youth of the time.\r\n\r\nMaybe that's why the humor hardly works clearly: I could still understand most of the jokes minimally but, for example, I don't know anything about comics and all the jokes about that are unintelligible to me. I believe the same thing happens to a lot of people: we are not part of the target audience and the feeling is that of a somewhat dated, niche film that has not aged very well.\r\n\r\nThe script has its moments: there are several conflicting plots, some of which (the boy obsessed with a painting where everyone sees a sailboat, for example) are very stupid and seem out of context. In fact, there seems to be no possible context for them! The same cannot be said about the main plots of the two couples at odds. We can say that they are absurd, but this is normal in the case of a movie that uses absurdity for a jocular purpose. For the rest, and even considering that I've seen better, it's not a film that I can say I hated seeing, although I don't intend to see it again.\r\n\r\nClaire Forlani, very young and beautiful, plays her role with panache alongside Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty and Jason Lee, three young promises who would not have a bright future as actors, even though they remain active and working. It's fair to say that everyone made their own effort and left a positive mark, but it's not fair to forget Stan Lee's contribution, in a very honorable special appearance, and the work developed by Ben Affleck, Michael Rooker, Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith. It's one of those films where the auxiliary cast has almost as much weight and relevance to the final product as the four protagonists. In fact, a large part of what makes the film work after so many years is, precisely, the quality of the characters and the way they manage to please us."], [], [], ["Circle of Friends is a little feel good sort of movie. The ensemble characters interact quite well. I have always liked Minnie Driver, and Alan Cummings seems to nail the smarmy characters like this. I think he was in a Jane Austen adaptation film with a similar role.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on one of the best Maeve Binchy novels, in my opinion. It concerns Bennie, Driver\u2019s character, who has a self-esteem problem based partly on her weight and unpopularity. But she stands up for herself when she has to, and makes friends. She overcomes problems I won\u2019t go into and risk giving details away, but suffice to say you should really end up rooting for her.\r\n\r\nMy only problem with the movie is the ending. I felt the book had the perfect ending, and the movie went a different way. Don\u2019t get me wrong; if I hadn\u2019t read the book, I am sure I would have been a-okay with the movie ending. I just thought the book nailed it. But movies and books have different story arcs sometimes, and it wouldn\u2019t stop me from watching Circle of Friends again if the opportunity comes along.

A truly multi-talented Gary Oldman is on good form as Bernard Rose guides us through the life, and fairly frequent loves, of this genius. His flaws are writ large from the beginning; his, at times, quite brutal upbringing and his womanising certainly didn't make him the nicest of men; and as his deafness takes over his character becomes more irascible and unpredictable. The story is presented as a retrospective, starting at his funeral, and is largely described through the perspective of his friend Anton Schindler (a considered effort from Jeroen Krabb\u00e9) and we see how his nature could vacillate from kindly, cruel, passionate and loving to selfish and vile. There are strong supporting contributions from Isabella Rossellini and Johanna Reiss that help keep this film focused and engaging. There are also ample opportunities to hear some of his music played, quite possibly, in a venue he would have himself attended. The attention to detail is superb: costumes, sets and locations all looking excellent. The dialogue is sparing, but it's what they all do with it - especially Gary Oldman - that helps make this film stand out. Two hours just flew by, and if you are fan of the music and interested in the man - then this is a good watch."], ["Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nIf for nothing else, then you should watch this because this is \"the movie where the guy is pregnant\", but I'm not sure we need a reboot: one is probably enough.\r\n\r\nIt helps that this is a good movie with a great cast.  I felt bad they made Danny Devito run so much, but Arnold is great as a pregnant man, and sometimes a woman, and Emma Thompson does a wonderful absent-minded professor.\r\n\r\nIt's a unique premise, it's a good premise, and for a comedy without lasers, aliens, or explosions, there is a lot of excitement.\r\n\r\nGive it a watch, it's all about the execution that makes this one great."], [], ["Despite the fact that for much of this I hadn't really much of a clue who was trying to outmanoeuvre whom, I thoroughly enjoyed this historical dose of state sponsored murder and mayhem. Presided over by the imperiously devious Catherine de Medici (Virna Lisi) we follow the machinations at the French court of her sons as they vie for power in France and in Navarre whilst reconciling the growing number of Huguenots (Protestants) in their midst demanding an end to the power of the Catholic church over the state and the poverty stricken people. It's to that end that she marries off her eponymous daughter, Margaret de Valois to the fairly insipid King Henry of Navarre (Daniel Auteuil). He's a puppet for just about everyone and she has little interest in the marriage from the outset. She gets her kicks from the handsome and possibly the most chivalrous of her associates - La M\u00f4le (Vincent Perez) but we all know that they are but pawns in brutal game where lives at just about every level of society mean nothing at all! Assassinations, poisonings, rapes - nothing is off limits as this story of power-crazed depravity and scheming soldiers on for just over 2\u00bd hours of blood and sweat and - well that, too! Isabel Adjani delivers a career best performance in the title role, but Auteuil and her brother Charles IX (Jean-Hughes Anglade) also help to deliver the thrust of the story well and entertainingly. Beware, it's no history lesson - if you're looking for factual accuracy then you might be wasting your time. It's a scandalous exposure of absolute dynastic rule that treats tragedy and joy with equal short-termism. The production looks great - it's actually quite uncomfortably difficult to watch at times, but if you like your history gritty, dark and uncompromising then Patrice Ch\u00e9reau has created something well worth watching.

Will Smith also makes me laugh, but that's about it."], ["What do you love about the law, Andrew?\r\n\r\nAndrew Beckett is a gay lawyer infected with AIDS, who in spite of being his law firm's rising star, is fired on a trumped up charge of negligence. Refusing to accept defeat, Andrew manages to enlist the help of homophobic lawyer Joe Miller, whom it's hoped, can prove that the firm acted disgracefully out of fear of Andrew's illness. But can Joe throw off his own prejudice? Can Andrew keep it together as AIDS starts to take a hold? \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia was the film to really bring the horrors of AIDS to the masses. Though certainly not the first film to deal with the subject, films such as \"An Early Frost (1985)\" and \"As Is (1986)\" had led the way, Philadelphia is certainly the most memorable of all the mainstream films dealing with the subject. \r\n\r\nAs the years have rolled by, the film's standing has waned some what, gays have renounced the film as over sentimental gloop and various other cinema critics have accused the film of confusing its aims. The truth is that Philadelphia is only really guilty of playing it safe. Andrew Beckett is clearly wronged, and he's clearly a lovely and special man, supported by a complete and loyal loving family. It's the character set up that never really puts the film in any real danger of becoming edgy, even the strand dealing with homophobia is only briefly given credence. However, where the makers do achieve their aims, is with the emotional aspects, something that lifts Philadelphia to a far higher plain in the pantheon of emotional kickers. \r\n\r\nThe tone of the film is set courtesy of Bruce Springsteen's Oscar winning \"Streets Of Philadelphia\", which acts as a sombre portent of things to come during the opening credit sequence. From here on in the story is content with gnawing away at our heart strings and breaking down prejudice barriers in the name of fair play and adult fallibility's. Part court room drama and part human tragedy, Philadelphia is never found wanting in the engrossing department, something that is in no small amount due to the work of a firing on all cylinders cast. \r\n\r\nTom Hanks is always pretty safe company to be in as a rule, but tackling the role of Andrew Beckett required much more than merely charm and a homely appeal. Hanks, winning his first Best Actor Oscar, steps up to the plate here and delivers one of the best performances of the 90s. As AIDS ravages his body and soul, Hanks as Andrew reaches deep down within and has the audience with him all the way through his ordeal. Alongside Hanks is Denzel Washington as Joe, who if anything has the more prickly role to contend with. It's probably not much of a surprise to most followers of his to say he's on his usual great form here, with a shift in his character's fortitude showcasing the best of the New Yorker's ability. Rounding out the cast, and with equally fine performances are Jason Robards, Joanne Woodward, Robert Ridgely, Mary Steenburgen and Antonio Banderas. Then as surely as Springsteen's opener had set the mood, Neil Young closes the film down with his own heart achingly brilliant \"Philadelphia\", playing alongside some video footage that finally seals the deal as to why Philadelphia as a movie exists. \r\n\r\nRevisits to the film show up its minor flaws, but as someone who remembers how he, and the other multi sexed audience reacted on leaving the cinema back in 1993, it's the kind of impact that to my mind can never be understated. 9/10", "Yet another of those movies I watched close to when it came out umpteen years ago, and only recently watched again.\r\n\r\nFor entertainment value, it hasn\u2019t aged particularly well for me. I am not sure I can even describe why, except that it seemed to lack energy. There are a lot of good small moments, but its big moments struggle to live up to their potential. The courtroom scenes slow the story down in places, and the climactic scene that decided the case wasn\u2019t convincing to me. \r\n\r\nStill, this was an important movie addressing the AIDS when it came out, and the two low lead actors, even though they both give an understated performance, carry the film quite nicely.", "Compelling performances by both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. And to think I almost didn't watch this because the poster doesn't look like Hanks...", "**A dense, disturbing, difficult, but highly relevant film.**\r\n\r\nWell, those who has the patience and charity to read what I write may have already realized that I'm not a big fan of overly militant films, even if they are causes or ideas that I defend or with which I tend to agree. For me, cinema is above all entertainment and artistic expression, not a political, social or belief manifesto. However, it is really difficult not to make an exception when it comes to discrimination against people in the workplace. I know what my friendly reader is probably thinking: the film isn't about that, it's about AIDS. It is true. But AIDS is a pretext to justify what happens to that man. He is discriminated against and loses his job for being homosexual.\r\n\r\nI won't waste a lot of time explaining what happens in the film. It's relatively old and almost everyone has seen it at least once: Andrew Beckett is a young lawyer with a promising future until he discovers that he has contracted AIDS in a casual sexual encounter with another man. The disease becomes increasingly obvious to his bosses, and he ends up being fired, which is why he decides to sue the firm, arguing that the real motivation for the dismissal was their prejudice regarding his (discrete) homosexuality, which the disease denounced.\r\n\r\nThe film is excellent and, at the time, did a lot to demystify AIDS, a disease about which there was little general knowledge and which many people feared because it was not very evident how it was spread. Nowadays, with more information and public knowledge, these myths have disappeared, but that does not prevent the disease from being one of the most feared, along with cancer or leukemia. However, the film was not able to detach AIDS from homosexuality. I understand this: a disease like this spreads easily in social environments where sexual behavior is more liberal, and we know that a good part of GLBT's do not have very stable relationships. But the truth is that we, today, know very well that AIDS can perfectly be contracted by heterosexuals who do not have the good sense to protect themselves. In fact, I tend to associate AIDS more with drug users, due to the enormous risk they run when consuming drugs in filthy environments and sharing needles with each other.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the film having a highly pertinent and heavy theme, which guarantees it a relevance and importance that it would otherwise never have, there is another reason this film is a success and has enormous repercussions: Tom Hanks. This is definitely the film that opened the horizons of his career, contributing decisively to making him one of the most beloved actors in the USA. He was still young here, he was coming out of a phase where he did a lot of quality comedies and the film was an opportunity to show his serious and dramatic side. Needless to say, the actor took advantage of every second and gave us one of the most significant works of his career, in a brutal odyssey that earned him the Oscar for Best Actor, a feat he scored twice the following year, with \u201cForrest Gump\u201d. Remarkable! Next to him, an energetic Denzel Washington, who just doesn't get duller and warmer because the actor's devastating charisma doesn't allow it... and it's not easy to put Denzel out of the limelight!\r\n\r\nIt's not a film that I feel deserves high marks on the more technical points. Johathan Demme, the director, had the good sense not to mask the film under tons of visual and sound gimmicks that the film did not require. It's a clean, smooth film, with a speech as direct as a punch in the audience's stomach. And believe me, it's one of those films that is difficult to watch, that makes you think and that doesn't make you happy at all. In any case, the cinematography, sets and costumes do a good job, and the courtroom scenes (a real room that was used for the film) are worth it for their realism. And if it is true that Bruce Springsteen rightly deserved the Oscar for the Original Song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d (which we hear practically in its entirety, during a long opening credits sequence), one of the singer\u2019s greatest hits, I must also point out the opera arias used in the film, which are mostly recordings of the eternal diva Maria Callas in various operas such as \u201cAdriana Lecouvreur\u201d, \u201cLa Vestale\u201d or \u201cAndrea Ch\u00e9nier\u201d. The contrast between the rawness of the film and its themes with the sublime beauty and lyricism of these melodies could not be more disconcerting.", "It's quite hard to overstate how significant this film was at a time when AIDS-driven homophobia was rife. Right from the outset with Bruce Springsteen's delicate opening ballad, this effectively counters an whole range of prejudices that prevailed not just in the USA but around the world. It's also, easily in my view, Tom Hanks's best performance as he plays hotshot lawyer \"Andy\" who has been feeling under the weather. Blood tests tell him the worst news that he shares with his loving family and boyfriend \"Miguel\" (Antonio Banderas) but he isn't really prepared to get fired from his job. Luckily, he had previously crossed paths with \"Joe\" (Denzel Washington) so he asks him to represent him in a wrongful dismissal lawsuit. \"Andy\" is candid about his sexuality and his condition and the clearly wary \"Joe\" politely declines. It's a chance meeting in a law library a few days later that illustrates just the tip of the bigotry iceberg being faced by the visibly sickening man to get fair treatment and so \"Joe\" relents. What now ensues is, on the face of it, just another courtroom drama but it is hugely augmented by the willingness of some serious Hollywood establishment names to showcase the genuine senses of fear, disgust and even hatred as the narrative unravels. Washington's character has his own prejudices to overcome and Jason Robards, though he features quite sparingly, is effective as the erstwhile boss who can barely disguise his contempt for his former star-employee. It's cleverly scripted avoiding too much sentiment or stereotype as it presents us with a potent look at a fight for justice - not just in the courtroom itself, but amongst a public opinion that is scared and hostile. Thought-provoking cinema that plays a strong hand well, and though not always an easy watch, it is well worth it."], ["**Hopkins and Attenborough in an emotional and feeling-filled work.**\r\n\r\nWhen I decided to see this movie, I knew little about the life of the writer C. S. Lewis, who I only knew from having written the books \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". And I confess that, in order to fully understand the film and also be able to write something about it, I had the curiosity and interest to read one thing or two about him. For example, I was very impressed by his deep connection to the university and his closeness to J. R. R. Tolkien, who is also the author of a great work of fiction. In fact, thinking about it, it is interesting to see how their works share a lot of points of contact, subtle similarities. But that's a thing for another review.\r\n\r\nThe film focuses on Lewis' life and, especially, on his love relationship with his American wife, Joy Gresham. Lewis was an academic, philosopher and theologian who left many works on these topics, and who unexpectedly decides to marry a recently divorced American, in a union that only later gave way to love between them. The film was inspired by a play, which in turn was inspired by the texts that Lewis wrote about what he experienced and felt.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about the film, for me, is the direction and the cast performance. The director, Sir Richard Attenborough, was known for his attention to detail, cinematography and choice of locations. Considered by many to be one of the great British film directors, this film leaves us with a work full of elegance and beauty, but which seems to be largely forgotten these days, undoubtedly deserving more attention.\r\n\r\nThe cast, in turn, is expertly led by Debra Winger and Sir Anthony Hopkins, a duo of actors of great quality and talent. Hopkins does deeply emotional work, in which we can see that he tried to employ a lot of feeling as well as intellect. Winger didn't impress me that much, but the great quality of her work is undeniable, especially in the moments when she plays with Hopkins or with her fictional son, played by a young boy, Joseph Mazello, who also deserves praise for a job well done. The rest of the cast gives the protagonists the necessary support, but does not stand out or stand out.\r\n\r\nThe film was filmed in Oxford, and we can see how Attenboroug tried to take advantage of the original places, where Lewis would have been and that he surely knew, such as the university and academic spaces. The film gives us an aroma of the atmosphere of the old and renowned institution, and of some of the ceremonies and traditions that take place there. The cinematography is very beautiful and makes the best use of light, close-ups, landscapes and the beauty of old buildings. There are no great effects here, nor does the film need that, but we have an effective soundtrack."], ["Last night I watched the Movie \u201cSirens\u201d on the TATaTU movie channel and what a treat. \r\n\r\nDirected by John Duigan, staring Hugh Grant, Ella Macpherson, Portia de Rossi, Sam Neil...\r\n\r\nWhen the Church decides that one of the paintings for an upcoming Art Exhibit is \u201cBlasphemous\u201d they ask a young Minister, played by Hugh Grant, to travel to the Artist\u2019s Studio in Australia to convince him to remove the painting from the show.\r\n\r\nWhen the Minister and his young wife arrive at the Studio they are greeted by the Artist played by Sam Neil, his wife and the 3 very beautiful models that are the subjects of his paintings.\r\n\r\nThe Minister and the Artist, along with the models and wives discuss the seemingly overt sexual content and blasphemous nature of the painting in question and many philosophical and often comical debates ensue.\r\n\r\nAs the Title would suggest the 3 models are magically enchanting in all they do and eventually tempt the Minister\u2019s wife to join them in their ways.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to say much more without giving it all away.....\r\n\r\nThe Cinematography and Acting are wonderful.\r\n\r\nIn Greek mythology, the Sirens lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and singing voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island.\r\n\r\nI remember hearing about this movie back in the late 90\u2019s, always wanted to see it and thanks to Johnny Depp\u2019s new Free Movie Network I was able to watch it for Free.\r\n\r\nRating: 4.5/5 Stars"], [], ["A street credibility Pygmallion!\r\n\r\nEdward Lewis is a very rich man, but money, as everyone knows, does not buy everything, and as yet another failed relationship falls by the wayside, Edward faces up to the prospect of a hectic social week on his own.

He spends much of his day contemplating or sleeping erect on his cruciform ornament in the great hall whilst the remainder of his rather eccentric family, and their boozy butter \"Tucker\" (Arthur Lowe) go about their business. They decide the only way to deal with him is to marry him off, beget an heir, then parcel him off to the asylum so they can resume their ordinary lives... What's probably most notable about this very theatrical black comedy is that it deals with just about everything from religion to vivisection, blasphemy (for many) to insinuendo (that's insidious innuendo in case you didn't know) and almost certainly would not be made now, 50 years on - being about as politically incorrect as it conceivable to be. British cinema always seems to take rather dim view of the church when it comes to comedy, and here Alastair Sim nobly continues with that tradition; Lowe is super as the butler - who's inherited \u00a330,00 from the deceased so is in clover (when he is sober) and the two performances from William Mervyn and Coral Browne as his principal protagonists are amusing as their dastardly scheme takes shape. Sadly, though, it's all way too intense a pace to sustain, and despite the Oscar-nominated efforts of the star, the story begins to run out of steam quite quickly and the joke to wear a bit thin. There is nothing at all subtle about the humour and after a while I just stopped laughing. It is a beautifully shot film, the former Astor residence of Cliveden providing the setting for the ancestral family home, and the score from John Cameron mixes the original with just about everything from sea shanty fo high opera to ably support this preposterous swipe at the class system. It is too long, indeed it is far too long, but at times it shows creative British film making at it's most innovative and amusing and fans of O'Toole will probably appreciate (as would he, I suspect) the wedding scenes near the end...

The newbie\u2019s roommate turns out to be the most brilliant freshman in history, who\u2019s now a senior and seemingly clouded by college-age mischief (Val Kilmer). Michelle Meyrink plays a kinetic student interested in Mitch (Jarret) while Jonathan Gries appears as a curious wraith-like individual. Robert Prescott is on hand as a brown-nosing foil.   \r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of the filmmaking style, the director also made 1983\u2019s \u201cValley Girl.\u201d \u201cReal Genius\u201d is generally on par with that more popular movie, but different due to the setting being college rather than high school, not to mention that it involves genius types. I found the witty nonchalance of Kilmer\u2019s character to be trying after a while and there\u2019s a pervading sense of un-reality about the proceedings with the peripheral characters unconvincingly over-the-top, like during the pool party or at the restaurant/bar. The ice playground at the frat house is another good example. Why sure!     \r\n\r\nStill, there\u2019s enough good here if you like 80\u2019s youth dramedies.

Of course, it fits into the young thinking of the time: rebellion, revolt against institutions and parents, incapable of understanding their children, but it combines humor, youthful boldness and a certain education that does not give space to slang or obscene situations. After all, it is possible to make a funny youth film without barracks or sorority jokes, and without a permanent obsession about sex.\r\n\r\nThe story is set in a university (or pre-university) institute, where young people with great mental capacity and ingenuity are recruited for advanced scientific projects. It turns out that one of them is, actually, a secret super weapon that the US Army plans to have, something that not even these teens know about. In the midst of that, the usual conflicts and friendly interactions between them, the rebellion of one of them towards the institution itself and its rules, clandestine parties and other jokes and mischiefs.\r\n\r\nThe script is quite creative and the technical conception of the film deserves praise, thanks to the good sets, special effects, editing and cinematography. However, what supports the film is the unpretentious and witty work of Val Kilmer, who shows us that he was really talented when he didn't have movie star tics or try to be the heartthrob, as in later films.

A timely intervention from the US Navy rescued some of the crew, but then subjected the erstwhile cargo to an humiliating and debase battle for their \"ownership\". Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) takes up the cudgels on their behalf - at no small risk to himself, and with the assistance of former US President John Quincy Adams (Sir Anthony Hopkins) takes this principle all the way to the Supreme Court. It is most bizarre to watch this and even begin to contemplate a society in which the concept of one person, business, or nation claiming the possession of a human being is actually being discussed by rational people in a court of law, but here we have it. The film looks great, plenty of attention to the detail with the costumes and the sets but there is far too much incidental dialogue and the pace of the story seems more intent of delivering a story of epic length rather than meaningful drama. Sir Anthony delivers well in the last fifteen minutes with a most potent piece of oratory; this is probably the best effort we have yet seen from McConaughey and there are strong supporting roles from Sir Nigel Hawthorne (Van Buren); an impressive Djimon Hounsou - who has no English dialogue - as the leader of the incarcerated and Morgan Freeman also delivers well as he tries to facilitate the freedom and potential repatriation of these people back to modern day Sierra Leone.

Teri Hatcher plays the industrialist\u2019s wife while Michelle Yeoh is on hand as a Chinese agent with whom Bond teams up.  \r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow Never Dies\" (1997) is a competent enough Bond flick with loads of action highlighted by the opening terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border, a melee at a newspaper factory in Hamburg, an underwater investigation of a wreck near the South China Sea and a wild motorcycle chase in Saigon with 007 handcuffed to the Chinese agent. Hatcher is another highlight in one of the best \u201cwhoa, mama\u201d moments in the franchise\u2019s history, albeit brief.

Next thing we know, \"007\" is drafted in to find out just what happened before the world finds itself facing an international conflagration that seems designed to ensure that \"Carver\" gets media rights in the hitherto unwilling China.

An unremarkable actress at the best of times, she brings a little glamour but very little else to this frequently rather (contrived) dialogue-heavy enterprise. Dame Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer renew their long established partnership for a few scenes, and Desmond Llewellyn gets a few extra ones which is nice to watch.

It was probably the best Bond song since The Spy Who Loved Me.\r\n\r\nBrosnan is a little more cold blooded in this, you catch glimpses of 007 being Connery/Dalton/Flemming Era 007 again. He doesn't shy away from executions with a cunning quip.\r\n\r\nBut, honestly, it's Michelle Yeoh's Wai Lin that really puts it over-the-top and makes it the best of the Dalton Era 007's. He has met his match with this Chinese counterpart who, and he has certainly done it before, but this time she comes across as clearly being as good as Bond himself.

For all intents and purposes, Fair Game is a decent action movie, although overindulgent in most aspects (huge explosions, gratuitous boob shots of Cindy Crawford, nudity, a famous sex scene and one-note acting). The film was designed solely as a vehicle to capitalize on the enormous popularity of Cindy Crawford, the hottest Supermodel of the 1990's... and in that respect, it had enormous success. Fair Game has become a sort of Cult classic, based on the adoration for Crawford's sex appeal and a brief, early role by Salma Hayek.

The story takes unexpected turns, always remaining interesting, the distinctive characterisations breathing heavy, managing to off set the run of the mill stereotypes in the supporting ranks.

The scenario is nothing new - mankind is dependent on technology and about to be subject to a criminally backed corporation's attempts to dominate us. This time, it falls to our hero and his semi-luddite pals to access a micro-chip embedded in his brain to save humanity from oblivion. It's quickly paced, to be fair, and the star does an adequate job trying to keep one step ahead of his deadly, if not terribly effective, Yakuza pursuers but the dialogue is flat (and not terribly audible) and the supporting cast - drawn from a collection of B-listers, musicians and featuring the discobolus-like Dolph Lundgren as baddie-in-chief just follows a join the dots pattern.

I mean the flashback reveals everything and remains as a mystery.\r\n\r\nThe story follows a man who himself declares the real Don Juan DeMarco, the greatest lover of the world. So he ends in a psychiatric centre for the treatment after trying to commit suicide. A doctor who is on the verge to retire set to treat him and when the DeMarco narrates his life story, the doctor too inspires to reinstate his romantic life. The remaining narration tells how they work out to solve the issue once for all.\r\n\r\nNot a masterpiece, but kind of interesting drama, particularly for how the film characters were drawn. And the story was built cleverly, till the final scene by giving out the viewers a positive message that worth living life to love and to be loved. So if you opt it for the title, not a bad choice, since the theme remains about the love, even the person you are looking for is not present. More like it is a metaphor, when it comes to the real Don Juan and the one in this film. Like people say god is everywhere, the love is as well and so the version/personality of Don Juan in every person.\r\n\r\nJohnny Depp was so good, an ideal person to play the title role.

Todays writer and directors are clever at doing that, but it should come from a big banner with big names. Maybe Johnny Deep to play the doctor in the modern version.

Brando was verging on 70 during shooting and would only do four more feature films while Depp was a rising star who wouldn\u2019t hit it big for another five years, as far as box office success goes. While the movie performed mediocrely in America, it made almost three times its cost worldwide and thus was considered a success for New Line Cinema. \r\n\r\nThis was Marlon\u2019s beefiest role since \u201cThe Missouri Breaks\u201d (1976) and \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d (1979) with the rest of his late-era films having minimal parts (for big bucks).

It's the latter man who also beings to impress upon the doc just how his own marriage has stagnated over the years and perhaps these romantic tales are having more of a beneficial effect on the clinician than they are on the patient! Meantime, corroborating evidence is being conflictingly provided as to just whom \"Don Juan\" actually is. Might he even be the real thing? It's quite entertaining in spurts, this film, but there are not enough of them and the shrink-session style of conversation starts to run out of steam and rather repeat itself after a while.

Critics reviled it, obviously because the subject matter made it an easy target but it has a lot of heart once you look beyond the prostitution component. For instance, Frank really just wants a caring mother, as well as a wife for his lonely, workaholic father who needs a good woman to rock his mundane world. The question is, can a call girl possibly be a \u2018good woman\u2019? In other words, is there redemption for a soiled sex worker and what is the key to that redemption? Not only is love the answer it\u2019s also the element necessary for bringing out submerged love in the one being redeemed.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a lesson about objectifying a woman.

But I'm afraid all those expectations have been crushed, and what's left is a mediocre offering that will go down as the third best 'Bad Boys' film... possibly until 'Bad Boys 4' arrives.\r\n- Jess Fenton\r\n\r\nRead Jess' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-bad-boys-for-life-whatcha-gonna-do-when-theres-nothing-new", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI was never a big fan of the Bad Boys films. Firstly, I'm not too fond of Michael Bay as a director (as a producer, he's fine). The way he directs his action sequences is incredibly choppy, filled with questionable CGI, very hard to follow, and we all know his passion for exploding everything. Oh, and I can't forget about the constant product placement (amazing how in a brutal explosion, everything is destroyed except a gorgeous-looking Audi car that remains intact). Secondly, the storytelling always felt extremely generic and unsurprising. So, obviously, my expectations weren't very high\u2026\r\n\r\nMaybe that's why I enjoyed Bad Boys For Life way more than I anticipated. This movie should be a lesson to the Fast and Furious franchise. To make a mindless entertaining action flick, the lighthearted tone has to be well-established from the get-go. Despite the fact that the third act deals with absurd emotional twists worthy of a Mexican soap opera, the screenwriters are able to find just the right amount of harmless fun. I didn't watch a single clip before the film, and ten minutes in, I acknowledged that its goal was to simply be entertaining without taking itself too seriously.\r\n\r\nAdil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah balance the more dramatic family issues with the ludicrous action very well. The latter sequences are much better than Bay's. The car chases, even when containing a few too many cuts, are relatively easy to follow, and they pack that necessary adrenaline rush. There are a few surprising shootouts that are filmed to make them look like one take, which definitely brings something pretty uncommon to this kind of formulaic action movies. Technically, I think both directors did an excellent job, especially considering that this was their debut feature film.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story brings everything down. I believe Mexican soap operas might have better scripts. The dialogue reaches such a cringe-worthy level. Every essential plot information is given either through lazy character interactions or by that magical computer that every generic action movie possesses with which the main characters can basically know everything about everyone at the click of a few buttons. The comedy is quite hit-and-miss to me, a lot of the jokes didn't land, but some did make me chuckle. Overall, the screenplay is as cliche as it could be, and that last shot\u2026 I hate it. In the end, it's the cast who saves the boring narrative.\r\n\r\nWill Smith and Martin Lawrence share fantastic chemistry, and their banter is always entertaining to watch, even if it isn't as hilarious as it could be. I liked Lawrence more than Smith, maybe due to the non-action, family comedy bits that worked seamlessly. Nevertheless, it's dumb fun, and it's plainly visible that the actors had a blast shooting this movie. The whole cast transfer the joy that they had on set to the screen, and it's pretty noticeable. Watching Alexander Ludwig (Dorn) outside Vikings is always a pleasure (I so wish that he gets more important roles in the future), and the whole AMMO team (Vannesa Hudgens, Charles Melton, Paola Nunez) is all compelling enough, even if the characters are two-dimensional.\r\n\r\nIt's simple: whether you enjoy the Bad Boys saga or not, this is undoubtedly the best installment of the franchise. If you go to the film theater with basic expectations of having fun, Bad Boys For Life gives you that, so I recommend it. It's a pure popcorn-entertainment action flick with recognizable actors who all share great chemistry. With Michael Bay out of the director helm, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah deliver surprisingly good action sequences, considering this is their debut feature film. The formulaic, cliche, soap opera story is straight-up ridiculous at some points, and it carries such an aura of predictability that when it tries to introduce an emotional twist, it merely becomes absurd. The last shot feels like a call to Hollywood to make more sequels, which sort of ruins the whole \"Bad Boys one last time\" tagline\u2026 I'm extremely undecided on which side this review should fall, so I'll base my decision on the answer to the following question: \"Am I going to (want to) see this movie again or another sequel?\" Honestly\u2026 no.\r\n\r\nRating: C+", "Another action packed movie for fans of  bad boys.", "You know what you're getting.", "It was very fun and entertaining to watch.

I don't know if that's entirely fair, because the movie is quite entertaining and works well, providing some nice, enjoyable fun for everyone\u2026 even non-basketball fans like me, who've never even seen a game.\r\n\r\nThe plot is simple: a group of tiny, seemingly unthreatening aliens are willing to do anything to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to their planet.

But lo and behold, the aliens steal the talent of top NBA players and turn into monsters, dominating the match. Aware of the situation, Bugs and Daffy Duck decide to bring in Michael Jordan, who had retired to play baseball.\r\n\r\nThe film was, financially, a safe bet for Warner Bros. We don't just have Looney Tunes, the crazy creatures we've grown used to after decades of cartoons, but also basketball, a particularly popular sport in the US. In addition to Jordan, other famous players of the time will appear in the film, also representing themselves, in addition to their teams, and I have no doubt that the NBA paid a lot of money for all this publicity. And it's not even worth talking about the huge amount of products that come up strategically or that are named in the dialogues, and that also paid for it. Add to the advertising revenue the box office receipts (it was the most successful basketball movie to date) and all the merchandising that was sold afterward, from toys to coasters... and we have an idea of \u200b\u200bhow profitable the movie was for the studio.\r\n\r\nMichael Jordan made his cinematic debut here, as it was the first (and, I think, the only) feature film he starred in. He's not an actor, he's not trained as such, but he managed it reasonably well, which shouldn't have been too difficult, as everything was limited to playing himself and making a few passes with the ball. The other players also did a decent job, and seem to be enjoying while parodying themselves. In the dramatic field, it is really Bill Murray who shines, as a professional comic actor, giving us the best performance in the film.

It stars Nick Nolte, Chazz Palminteri, Melanie Griffith, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Jennifer Connelly, Treat Williams, John Malkovich, Bruce Dern and Andrew McCarthy. Music is by Dave Grusin and cinematography by Haskell Wexler.\r\n\r\n1950s Los Angeles and four unorthodox detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nolte) are called in to investigate the death of a young woman found crushed at a construction site. The woman is revealed to be an aspiring actress who had recently had a relationship with the married Hoover. Can is open, and worms everywhere, and following those worms leads Hoover down murky avenues...\r\n\r\nIt's the almost nearly great neo-noir movie, everything looks right in principal, it has a strongly assembled cast, the 50s visuals and cinematography are splendid, and the murder mystery element of the plot - with some added sex, sizzle and nuclear shenanigans - looks promising on the page. Yet it never delivers on that promise of being something dark, to be a labyrinthine noir thriller beating a black heart.\r\n\r\nIt starts of so well, based on the infamous \"Hat Squad\" we reasonably expect the story to expand upon the opening macho machinations of the four tough hombres in the hats, but instead away from Nolte's grizzled Hoover, the other three guys are merely dressed up props. Which means there's some good actors wasted, sadly.\r\n\r\nAs the plot moves slowly forward the investigation and Hoover character axis becomes less interesting. Griffith came in for some critical grief for a lacklustre performance, but she's done no favours by the writers who fail to give her marriage to Hoover any substance. So when things go pear shaped and the characters of Mr and Mrs Hoover should explode on the screen, we really don't care having had no interest previously to hang our emotional being on.\r\n\r\nIt all builds to what can best be described as a poor pay off, the resolution to the hinted at muddy mystery is hardly shocking, and the \"big\" face-off sequence between good and bad guys (or bad and bad if you prefer) is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It's not an awful movie, but it is a very disappointing one. A film where a bit more thought given by the producers could have yielded so much more. 5/10", "Well.... Andrew McCarthy does an excellent job, but everyone else kind of phones it in, including the director.\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be a kind of Neo Noir, but it never really feels as gritty or as mysterious as a noir should and the femme fatales never really feel as fatal and ominous and devious as they should.\r\n\r\nThe detectives aren't really hard boiled, not even Madison who always seems to be hard boiled. The detectives also never really get around to doing much detecting.\r\n\r\nIn the end it's really, honestly, only Andrew McCarthy that even looks like he's trying.

It's rooted in so many other stories that are much better executed; there is simply no menace or jeopardy at all, and John Carpenter seems unsure whether he wants an all-out action film or a semi-comedy. Russell is always at his more entertaining with the latter, here he just comes across as a man with a mission who is no more interested in the plot than I was. Steve Buscemi doesn't really add much either as the duplicitous \"Eddie\" and I am sure I spotted Peter Fonda in here too - a payday for a few actors who ought to have known better.

Sadly it has energy to burn but the execution of the comedy is weak to the point the makers have to resort to the base level of comedy writing to try and get laughs. \r\n\r\nThe odd line raises a chuckle, but quite often this is followed by a period of inanity, which in turn is followed by a ballsy action sequence (the makers very aware they quickly need to keep the demographic genre fans back on the clock). All this while a budding bromance - that's coupled with some lame homophobic undertones (a revolver up the butt gag?

Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration.\r\n\r\nThe look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on.

The dispirited citizens desperately need this lil\u2019 effervescent angel. Richard Egan plays a doctor, an ex-beau of the aunt who returns to town while Carl Malden plays the pastor seriously in need of an epiphany.  Nancy Olson, Adolphe Menjou and Agnes Moorehead also have key roles.    \r\n\r\nOn the surface, \u201cPollyanna\u201d (1960) is a quaint family drama with a little comedy, but it\u2019s heartwarming and tackles heavy real-life issues, particularly the crushing burden of legalism in which Christianity loses its heart and becomes a rule-oriented, lifeless religion where mere appearances are the all-and-end-all.\r\n\r\nOne of the best sequences is the menacing sermon on eternal damnation, which evokes both concern and amusement (Malden hams it up a bit), but there are several other worthy scenes. Pollyanna reminds me of this kitten we got as a gift, found near death in a game reserve. He was the happiest cat and spread love & joy to everyone, all the time. He was a gift from God, a veritable walking miracle.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal: Aunt Polly\u2019s mansion was located in Santa Rosa, the Bazaar sequences were done at Universal City and the railroad station scenes were shot in St Helena; other locations are Calistoga, Petaluma and Disney Studios, Burbank. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/B+", "Forty years after Mary Pickford made her successful version of Pollyanna, based on the children\u2019s book and a play, Walt Disney turned his creative team to the task.

Believing in a potential that might not exist, the scouts of the music world waste no time and the boys get a contract with a major label, which is waiting expectantly for equally good songs. However, sudden fame will test the strength of the group, the maturity and responsibility of that guys and their ability to resist the temptations that money and notoriety always make possible.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks is more than a protagonist, he is the engine that pulls the film and makes it possible.

Where the film stands out is in its attention to historical details, in the care with which it seeks to recreate the era and environments through the choice of suitable props, good costumes and make-up, as well as a set of excellent sets.

Since she wants to make her town a better place, including her major platform of getting the road to the hospital paved, Maryam and her sisters (Dae Al Hilali, Nora Al Awadh) begin planning fundraising and campaign events while their widowed musician father is away on tour.

The film is disgusting, perhaps one of the most disgusting I have ever seen. I say this for the worst reasons. It really is a film that makes you vomit due to the images and situations it presents to us. It doesn't scare us, it never scares us. And no, it never makes us laugh, so it's not a comedy. It's a piece of cheese, but full of mold.\r\n\r\nThe film relies heavily on special effects and makeup to work, so we can't expect great performances from the cast or a solid script.

I don't feel, therefore, encouraged to talk about the cast or any of the actors, as each of them is amateur and unhappy in the work they do.\r\n\r\nFor all this, I have doubts that the film has been seen in many cinemas outside English-speaking countries.

In fact, it's hard to think that the great director Peter Jackson, who is so widely respected today, started out with such bad work.\r\n\r\nApparently, Jackson was enchanted by the cheap horror of the 80s and the bad taste comedies that also populated this decade, where it seems that tastes were all changed. The film is completely amateurish and this can be seen in the terrible cinematography full of grain and the clumsy and disconnected editing. There are some effects, but almost everything is cheap and sounds plastic, fake and ugly. Still, considering the modest budget and lack of quality resources, I think Jackson did a decent job. Perhaps the director himself, however, would prefer not to be remembered for this film!\r\n\r\nThe story couldn't be more oily and greasy: we have an alien invasion of a small rural community, in which the aliens are simply looking for a good source of protein, which is obviously us, humans.

One is that this opera singer (Cynthia) finds solace with a young postman (Jules) who is pretty much a stalker (who stole her dress after a performance). The other bigger issue, is one dubious hero is a child predator who has a girl, easily only 13-14 years old, living with him. They don't explicitly show a sexual relationship but it's implied. I know this is France in the early 80s, just made me uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nStill, some decent scenes, one a chase through Paris and the Metro, that makes it worthwhile and oddly, the relationship between Jules and Cynthia still works in spite of how they meet.\r\n\r\nAlso noteworthy is the beautiful cinematography, some wonderful images. **3.5/5**", "**A very experimental film in terms of visuals and aesthetics, but one that disappoints us due to the poor conception of the characters and the lack of harmonization of the plot.**\r\n\r\nThis film harmoniously brings together two arts that I greatly value: cinema, of course, and opera, which for me is the most complete, challenging and versatile stage art that exists. Although the film is not about opera and is far from perfect, it is delightful to hear Wilhelmenia Fernandez's melodious voice. Unfortunately, the script could have been better: there are a number of rough edges that should have been polished.\r\n\r\nJean-Jacques Beineix gives us a stylized work, with notes of artistic quality, however, the story he tells us has problems: it all starts with a fan's curious obsession with his favorite opera singer. After stealing the dress she wore during a recital, he becomes friends with a young Vietnamese woman who steals records from a music store. Shortly afterwards, their paths cross with a group of dangerous killers who claim victims in public, disguised as police officers. After some more time, the opera singer finally meets her obsessed fan and becomes friends with him.\r\n\r\nThat is, what we have are two subplots that try to intertwine into a single story. The problem is that the union doesn't work out very well: they are too different and both want the same type of attention and protagonism. It doesn't work! With the exception of the opera singer, the characters are uninteresting, unsympathetic or underdeveloped, and there is no logic in the way they move and the decisions they make (not even the singer, who is suddenly unaware of the fact that her voice has been finally recorded \u2013 something she didn't allow and hated \u2013 and starts to feel incredible about having an obsessive fan behind her).\r\n\r\nWhat's good about this film? The look and aesthetics. The cinematography is quite skillful in experimenting with light, shadow and framing, and there is some originality in the way the editing and editing were done. I really liked the work developed by Wilhelmeina Fernandez, as I said, but I also think that Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Andr\u00e9i tried his best to rise to the challenge he faced, even with weak material and a virtual absence of charisma.

Directed and written by Jim Jarmusch, it is not a pretentious film, quite the opposite, and does what films should do: entertain us with five good stories. Obviously, being Jarmusch, these stories touch on a lot of the more human side of common characters.\r\n\r\nRegarding the stories told in the film, we can summarize them in a message that will not please taxi drivers: in this film, they drive terribly badly and are unlikely to prove competent in their work. The story set in Los Angeles is perhaps the most uninteresting because, in fact, nothing happens except the taxi ride. I also didn't really like the story set in Paris, after all none of those characters seemed the least bit friendly, they were all idiots. The rest are better: the story set in New York is quite moving and shows the more human and understanding side of a grumpy (it seems they are all like that) New Yorker; In Rome, we have a spirited taxi driver who decides to take advantage of the ride with a priest to confess his most outrageous bedroom peccadilloes; in Helsinki, there is a suffering taxi driver telling his sorrows to three drunk passengers.\r\n\r\nOkay, the film isn't exactly the most interesting or the most appealing, it doesn't have a flashy script and the stories told aren't even anything brutally interesting, but the truth is that the film, with a very bizarre comedy style, works. And the actors, who are very well selected, contribute a lot to this. Despite not liking the segment in which she appears, Winona Ryder is quite competent in her role and leaves us with a very pleasant feeling. Giancarlo Esposito and Armin Mueller-Stahl also don't leave us disappointed because they both interact wonderfully well and create a very good work dynamic. Roberto Benigni is virtually himself, anyone who is already familiar with the style and humor of this unique Italian actor will not find any major surprises here. Matti Pellonpaa does what he needs to do, but moves more discreetly than any of his colleagues. On the negative side, I found Rosie Perez perfectly irritating and histrionic, Gena Rowlands is excessively pedantic even though that wasn't her intention, Beatrice Dalle is rude and unfriendly, Isaach De Bankol\u00e9 has no interest and sometimes seems stupid in his dialogue and attitudes.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film exudes \"B series\" from every pore: the cinematography does not reveal any detail beyond the average, but what it does is well done; the visual and sound effects are effective but equally discreet; taxis really seem to be reliable vehicles and not theater props pulled by some trailer. The nighttime urban landscapes, with their lights and neon (it was still very fashionable) are everything we expected, and they are beautiful, but they are not the kind of beauty that would make us stare in rapture. I enjoyed observing the use of different languages in the various locations where everything happens. The clock and globe effects worked very well, but they feel quite cheap.

She has a bit role, but even back then (possibly unrefined, the role didn't have a lot to work with) she was a big personality in a small role.  She has one, brief, powerful scene that would really be worth remembering: most of it is the messing up the burglars.\r\n\r\nThis has a very different vibe than the first 2 movies.  While Kevin was isolated and unable to get help, Alex starts by doing everything right to get help, but no one believes him so he feels forced to \"do the right thing\".  However it manifests in almost a psychotic fashion.\r\n\r\nOf course, almost everything that happens in this movie should kill someone, but doesn't.  It also had a very easy out: at any time Alex could give the chip up, and it would be over, the bad guys leave the country: he's heavily volunteering for this carnage.  Kevin was being targeted, he saw their faces and was actually defending himself and his home because the \"wet bandits\" were coming for HIM.\r\n\r\nUltimately it's fun and charming, and interesting what the limits of technology were back in 1997 with cellphones and pagers, RC cars with block long range, but not wireless cameras, but remote control gizmos that can turn on the neighbors tv.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem I have with it is that his brother's bird is basically as smart a person, having conversations, and taking bribes (or insisting on being paid at least), and the worst bit is that I know there are people with birds as smart as that.

The love for that film, I feel, tends to skew opinions of the second instalment in what became the Scream foursome, Scream 2 seams perfectly from its starting point to up the daring ante, and plonk tongue even further into its cheek in the process.\r\n\r\nSidney Prescott has moved on from the horrendous murders in Woodsboro and is at college getting on with her life, but the peace and hope for a bright future is quickly shattered because the Scream killer is back for more carnage...\r\n\r\nThe film's opening perfectly sets out the tone for the entire picture, we see a cinema full of fake knife wielding youths dressed as the Scream killer, the film they are watching is Stab, the story of the Woodsboro murders. It's a wry commentary moment from Wes Craven, but in truth it's just one of many he makes in the film, the in jokes about sequels never gets tired, and the boo jump scare moments are all there to enjoy. Red Herrings come and go, and all the great characters who survived the first film are back again. Dewey & Gale get fleshed out a bit more, and one time caged innocent (and chief suspect) Cotton Weary is now a major character just begging us to find out if he's hero or villain.\r\n\r\nThis is a sharply scripted piece of work, it knows its aims and delivers what it sets out to do, it benefits from a brilliant sound mix to emphasise the mayhem, and Craven is something of a master in racking up the tension. To laugh and be scared is the order of the day, so sit back and enjoy a film that to me proves that not all sequels suck. Oh the ending does not disappoint at all either I have to say.\r\n\r\nScream 2 is a very worthy and enjoyable companion piece to the first film, very much so. 8/10", "So, moving along two years from the first carnage, \"Sidney\" (Neve Campbell) has moved into the Omega Beta Zeta frat house and is getting on with the her life. Well, that is what she hopes anyway but after a few minutes of this derivative and unimaginative sequel, we are back to square one when she learns on television that the grim reaper is back taking out fans at a sneak preview of \"Stab!\" - a film based on her first terrifying experiences. Then her friends start to drop, one by one - slasher style. Can she and reporter \"Gale Wethers\" (Courteney Cox) stay alive long enough to find out just who - or whom - is behind these ghastly crimes? I'm sorry, but this is just a straight and pretty shameless rip off of the first film. It's entirely devoid of menace or originality and the concluding twenty minutes are borderline farce. Wes Craven has a magic touch when it comes to gory action-horror films, but here he left it on the bathroom floor. This is just poor and repetitive and despite a competent cast just left me yawning after twenty minutes. Two hours is simply ninety minutes too long. I'm certain there will be a \"Scream 3\" - but I don't hold out high hopes.", "**_Scream 2_ starts off strong with a fantastic first act, but slowly stumbles into mediocrity with a lackluster finale.**\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this film was exhilarating, it was so messed up seeing how infatuated people were with this real-life killer and their seeming lack of awareness that a woman was being brutally murdered in their presence. They crank up the gore from the original, leading me to believe that we were going to be in for a treat, but I was wrong. The first act was really strong, and I enjoyed the college campus setting with some exhilarating scenes in the sorority houses. But towards the end of the second act, the film starts to drag on, with too much down time spent on character development and lackluster chase scenes. I think the main killer\u2019s motivation is pretty weak. They try to pull off a _Friday the 13th_-type reveal with Billy Loomis\u2019s mom, but it just doesn't land. She abandoned her child before the first film, and all of a sudden, after he becomes a killer, she wants to get revenge on the victim? It just does not make sense. I did enjoy Mickey, as he was the only interesting new addition to the film. This story had a lot of potential, but I can't help but feel it was slightly wasted.\r\n\r\nOur performances were mixed this time around. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox were fantastic; they are the true stars of the franchise, and their characters have such a nice arc here that I really appreciated, especially Cox. Jamie Kennedy was also great as the only character who truly realizes what is going on in this horror film, his commentary going forward will be missed. David Arquette was again pretty weak; I do think it mainly had to do with poor writing, as the crimpling walk he had to perform felt weird and in poor taste. Jerry O\u2019Connell was corny and forgettable. Liev Schreiber\u2019s character stinks. Timothy Olyphant was the only new addition that I genuinely enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe direction from Wes Craven was still great overall, with some fantastic scenes, particularly in the sorority house, that I thoroughly enjoyed. This may be personal taste, but I still think this franchise can push the horror and gore more. I feel they are giving us a tease in every film of what they are truly capable of.\r\n\r\nOverall, _Scream 2_ left a lot on the table for what could have been a really great sequel. It is still somewhat enjoyable, but it is hard to deny the massive step back it took from the original.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _63%_\r\n**Verdict:** _Decent_"], [], [], ["**A beautiful Italian production.**\r\n\r\nIf there is something that manages to cause serious expression problems in the most flirtatious and fluent of men, it is the ardent gaze of the girl he loves. I know this from experience, and any man who has been in love, at least once, knows that it is not easy to choose the right moment and the right words to express the greatness and beauty of feelings. Things get worse, of course, if the man is shy or less experienced in Cupid's dealings. Then, yes, things get really complicated!\r\n\r\nContrary to what the film might make us think, it is not necessary to be a poet to tell a beautiful woman that we love her. Well, from the little that has happened to me, what often happens is that love itself transforms us into incidental, fortuitous poets. And if the first verses are given to us by the gods, the muse of our affection easily inspires the rest. And that's how poetry is made: through the adventures and misfortunes of the heart of those who write it!\r\n\r\nThis Italian production tackles these questions by facing two characters who, otherwise, might never meet: one is Mario Ruoppolo, a former fisherman who became a postman because he doesn't get along with seasickness, and who feels not being able to express how he feels about the girl he is in love with; the other is the famous Chilean communist poet Pablo Neruda, famous for his socialist verbiage and for the romantic sonnets that earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature. The contrast could not be greater: the simplicity and natural shyness of the popular man and the expressiveness and charisma of a consecrated public figure. And if one has ascendancy over the other, I cannot say that the popular man seems to have had great importance for the public figure, despite the fact that the film tries to instill it.\r\n\r\nMassimo Troisi, in addition to assisting director Michael Redford, brilliantly secures the lead role, giving Ruoppolo a balanced dose of modesty, shyness and curiosity. The only negative criticism I can make of him is the way he fades and darkens whenever he has to play with Neruda, well played by Philippe Noiret. However, it cannot be denied that the best parts of the film are the dialogues and scenes in which both are together. And in fact, the dialogues deserve a special note, for the quality and the way they were done. Renato Scarpa is irritating due to the excessive politicization of his character, which is as tiresome and repetitive as the political discourse of most communist and socialist politicians. If we listen to one in a single speech, we listen to them all in everything they might want to say. Despite not appearing much and not really having much to do, Maria Grazia Cucinotta is a welcome addition to the plot, as well as being magnificent and so beautiful that any man in the street would turn his head to admire her for longer (something that happens much to the ragazze of Italy, on account of the great merit of their beauty).\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has some merits: if the cinematography is not particularly remarkable and looks misty and aged, the scenic beauty of the filming locations and the film's sets compensates for them, with plenty of room and with an abundance of light, sun, sea, magnificent outdoor scenes and truly breathtaking landscapes. The melody also deserves a frankly positive note: in addition to fitting harmoniously with the film and each scene, it is beautiful, very well conceived and stays in the ear.", "With things unstable in his native Chile, renowned poet \"Neruda\" (Philippe Noiret) takes refuge on a small Italian island where his arrival is greeted with little more than a realisation that they are going to need to hire an extra postman! Step forward \"Mario\" (Massimo Troisi). He can barely read or write but is determined to engage the visitor in conversation and to learn from him. Initially indifferent, \"Neruda\" begins to converse with him as he delivers the daily post and when he declares he needs some help to woo the charming \"Beatrice\" (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), he finds himself with a new mentor. Now it's fair to say that his first attempts are maybe just a little too rough and ready. Too many references to the shapeliness of her breasts and such like, but gradually \"Mario\" learns how to express himself more fully, more characterfully, and less earthily too. This education also opens his eyes to what has been going on around him for years. His island doesn't even have running water and with elections looming, he finds himself drawn to a communist cause as he watches the visiting politicians make promises he knows will never be delivered. His new found political awareness doesn't always go down so well with his compatriots who just want to get on with their simple, maritime, lives. This adaptation of Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta's book really does imbue the characters with a generous spirit and loads of charisma. It's all understated, and the evolution of \"Mario\" is really well handled by Troisi who sort of co-directed with Michael Radford and with a delicately honest effort from Noiret too. The cinematography benefits hugely from the natural island scenario which at times seems to mirror the emotions being played out by the people. This is also quite an effective analysis of what constitutes poetry itself. The subtlety of the structure of the words that don't rely on the all-too-familiar rhymes is used to good effect. Another film that befits hugely from a cinema screen to enjoy the brightness and Luis Bacalov score and is really worth a watch."], [], ["If anyone were ever to question the undoubted skill of cinematographer Roger Deakins, then they need only watch this beautifully crafted story of the youth of the 14th Dalai Lama. Filmed in the Moroccan Atlas mountains, for obvious reasons, Martin Scorsese provides us with a lavish, colourful and thought-provoking postulation on just how this young man was selected, after a four year search, to become the venerated spiritual leader of a peaceful nation of farmers and monks, buried deep in the Himalaya mountains. The boy was but two, but already there was a fear amongst these folks for whom time has largely stood still, that their neighbour has designs on their homeland. As the boy ages into youth, those threats manifest themselves more practically and by the end, the man has little choice but to embark on a perilous journey to safety in India. The actors are perfect for their roles - the three iterations of the principal character morph seamlessly together as he must learn to tread a very thin line and attain the level of political acuity necessary to deal with the disarming, but ruthless, Chairman Mao (Robert Lin). Philip Glass scores well too - grand and intimate orchestrations complimenting well the beautifully coloured costumes and the rising political temperature. It does take it's time, but it is a subtly delivered hypothesis, this. It suggests more than it imposes on history and that makes for a more complete film to enjoy. Sure it has a message, quite a few as it happens, but they are there for us to develop ourselves - Scorsese doesn't tell us what to think. He invites us. Deakins was nominated for an Oscar for this, and to appreciate that fully then do try to see it on a big screen. In any case, it's well worth a watch offering plenty of food for thought."], ["1.8 average rating on Letterboxd? Ouch!

The easy-on-the-ey (elder) Irvine is charismatic enough and Alexander delivers quite cheekily as his pal \"Pocket\" but I thought Fiennes just over-egged his part - way too theatrical - and HBC doesn't really have the clout to deliver the \"Havisham\" part in the overbearing yet sad style of, say, Martita Hunt. I always find that colour photography can be an enemy to stories like this. The issues of poverty and privilege that underpin so many of this author's stories always work better in grimy monochrome, and this one is just a bit too well produced.

'Billy\" is a bit of a thoughtless cretin and his behaviour leads to even more turmoil for his sister when \"Raymond\" finally flips and she is hospitalised. Believe it or not, this has the semblance of a love story to it. The relationship between \"Raymond\" and \"Valerie\" might actually run a bit deeper than that of an impoverished couple struggling through the motions from day-to-day. It's the evolution of that partnership that makes the characters a bit more interesting, but I felt the vitriolic and angry dialogue was mostly just a repetitive series of Anglo-Saxon tantrums and drug-fuelled anger - and that let it down for me. Still, Gary Oldman quite effectively shines a light on his perception of how life on a south east London housing estate is endured rather than lived.

Luckily, the initial in-your-face character establishment settles down and the somewhat preposterous plot takes over quite quickly.

He and his charge bond well - given the youngster has precious little salient dialogue; and it is action-packed enough to pass the two hours in a satisfactory way.

However, I didn't give up on Jean Pierre Jeunet and decided to see this film. I confess that I was impressed by the visual quality, but this is practically a trademark of the director, who seems to have a particular predilection for the color green (it was quite evident in Amelie, and in this film it was once again the dominant color of the chromatic palette). However, it returns to being, as \u201cDelicatessen\u201d had been, a rather strange, depressing and bizarre film. More bizarre than some Tim Burton movies, which isn't easy.\r\n\r\nIn view of what has been described above, I think it will not be surprising if I say that it is a film that is basically based on visual and special resources. There's immense visual effort here, and there's no doubt that Jeunet is behind it. The cinematography is very good, with an excellent filming work, and the sets deserve our attention. The costumes were designed by Jean Paul Gautier, so they're practically haute couture (with all the oddities that usually implies) and the soundtrack does a good job, too.\r\n\r\nThe cast is quite complete, and the characters are complicated and difficult to understand. I can even say that some characters look like caricatures or things out of Coney Island, from some freak show. I liked, however, the effort made here by Dominique Pinon, one of the great French actors of our time. He doesn't play just one character, but a legion of clones. I also liked Ron Perlman, he's good for this type of film, but honestly, I feel that the actor wasn't comfortable either with his role or with the material he was given. I don't know to what extent the language barrier was actually the cause of that, but it was the feeling I got.\r\n\r\nThe film is, essentially, a depressing and decadent futuristic dystopia, where a long-deranged scientist kidnaps children to steal their dreams.

However, everything else is extraordinarily complicated. It seems that the script didn't get the attention it deserved: there are parts that are very underwritten, points that don't make any sense, strange twists that seem to happen just to make everything even more strange and out of the ordinary. As a story told, it's an irritating and worthless movie.", "The basic premiss of this film is really quite simple. \"Krank\" (Daniel Emilfork) is super-bright, slightly deranged and lonely. He lives on a remote oil rig with only whom he can manufacture for companionship. His biggest problem is that he cannot dream. Without them he will die. He must, therefore, obtain as many other people's dreams as he can. To that end he constructs an entire community of one-eyed servants, a brain that lives in tank feeding on Alka Seltzer and some clones that are all led by the diminutively menacing \"Martha\" (Mireille Moss\u00e9). This \"family\" might have made \"Dr. Moreau\" proud. He hopes that they will help to collect enough kids to perpetuate his immortality. The thing is, all those he does manage to collect are nightmares because the children he kidnaps are all petrified of him. He needs some nice ones! Meantime, his army of robotic creations alight on \"Denree\" (Joseph Lucien) without reckoning on his determined strongman brother \"One\" (Ron Perlman) who is determined to fetch him back. He duly travels to their offshore structure and aided by the feisty \"Miette\" (Judith Vittet) and a lot of green wool, sets about trying to rescue his little brother - and all the others trapped in the installation - and to make sure that \"Krank\" and his hoodlums plunder no more. Emilfork is on great form as the archetypal mad scientist and Dominique Pinon looks like he's having great fun as the clones who do their masters's bidding whilst injecting some silly humour. There's an hybrid of stories here - part \"Frankenstein\", part \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" with costumes eccentrically designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier,  and it does rather meander at times - but this is a film about it's look and it's sheer imagination. It's as if someone had allowed Messrs. Caro and Jeunet unfettered access to the props department at MGM or Universal and told them to use what they can. They have the imagination of a child and boy do they use it. Mechanical gadgets, gizmos, green mists, dense fog. You name it and these allow the whole thing to imbue us with a sense of a playful, dark, adventurousness. It's comedic at times, threatening at others and there's a surprisingly effective chemistry between the usually wooden Perlman and his juvenile co-star Vittet that helps anchor the fantasy. It's surreal and gorgeous to watch and you'll need to suspend your expectations of linear, structured, cinema if you are to enjoy it. It's unique and creative. Probably a bit \"bonkers\" too!"], [], ["**An excellent film.**\r\n\r\nI was really curious to see this movie, because as far as I can remember it was the first Chinese movie I saw. Before I saw it, I read a little about it, and I was quite impressed to see how the film did well in the West, and managed to infuriate Chinese Communist censors. However, I fear that I was not fully prepared for what awaited me.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the film is truly brutal, in every sense of the word. Director Kaige Chen took a well-known and respected book for his film, but put all the focus on an almost visceral realism. The film is an epic that spans a large period of time, between 1924 and 1977, that is, very troubled years in Chinese history, which includes the entire period of war against Japan and the invasion of Manchuria, as well as the cultural revolution. Maoist.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it reveals the backstage of Cantonese opera, a traditional Chinese cultural style. In the film, two young apprentices live a cruel and unhappy life at the opera school, with daily beatings and various abuses, including sexual abuse. One of them will play the female characters in the stories, like a transvestite, since women are not allowed on stage. Throughout the film, there is a lot of confusion between life and art, and we often feel that these actors are mixing things up, living their characters in real life and transposing their real life to the stage.\r\n\r\nI don't know any of the actors in the cast, but I really liked their overall work, and the way they play opposite each other. The film also has extraordinary scenarios, full of realistic details, such as the construction of buildings, the lanterns. The actors' costumes also deserve applause, especially the characters in the opera, with all those fabrics and those strong face paints. Finally, a word for the wonderful cinematography, excellent opening credits and soundtrack."], ["**A somewhat surrealist film, which has value, but which is not for everyone's taste.**\r\n\r\nThis film is a little disconcerting. It is an uncompromising Western, frontal, very raw and sometimes difficult to understand. It all starts with William Blake, an accountant from the East Coast, taking a train to a remote place in the West, to accept a job in the company of an unscrupulous industrialist. It turns out that the vacancy was filled by someone else: at the end of the day, unmotivated, he goes to bed with a prostitute and ends up killing a man who tried to kill her out of jealousy. This man was the son of the factory owner, who sends henchmen after Blake, who is unaware of this and runs away, ending up in the company of a strange Indian named Nobody.\r\n\r\nThe film has great artistic note. It has excellent black and white cinematography, makes intelligent use of light, shadow, angles and filming framing. The sets and costumes are very good: they are not particularly rigorous from a historical point of view, the film was not concerned with being strictly framed in time and space, so that aesthetics prevails over the realism of the recreation. However, the aesthetic value is remarkable, and it gives us a raw, rough and dirty vision of the West. Jim Jarmusch ensures effective management that makes the most of what's in its hands. There are a good number of visual effects and the soundtrack, based on the electric guitar, is atmospheric and somehow fits into the film effectively, even if it is never one of the soundtracks that we will want to have on CD.\r\n\r\nThe film has a series of good actors, of which Johnny Depp stands out in an almost natural way. He was still young here, but he already showed his taste for playing the most bizarre characters. However, and perhaps because of the bizarre nature of the film itself, it is not one of the actor's greatest works. Iggy Pop, Robert Mitchum and Crispen Glover are also here, and they do an interesting and sincere job, in rough, tough characters, with few lines and a lot of presence and impact.\r\n\r\nThe big problem with the film \u2013 and it really is a big one \u2013 is that it is so apparently complex and almost surreal. At various times it is suggested that the character played by Depp is a man who is already dead, and there is almost a synesthesia between the accountant and his British namesake, who was an artist and poet and who would be, at the time of the events of the film, really dead! It's very strange, and such strangeness makes this not a film for everyone's taste."], ["**In the context of oriental cinema, it's a good film... but it's very different from the cinema that we, in the West, are used to, and this difference ends up killing our interest in this work.**\r\n\r\nI think this movie was the first Chinese movie I saw, I'm not really sure. I am not an expert on the cinema of this country, but I can say that it is one of those films that you see without much special interest. Of course, I'm talking about the standard audience, because there are really oriental film lovers who will be more interested in this material.\r\n\r\nThe script is based on the story of Song Lian, a very young and well-formed girl who, after her father's death, is coerced into finding a rich man to marry. She ends up being the fourth wife of a man, having to live with the other wives and learn how to behave in a complex family system, where rivalries and envy are part of everyday life.\r\n\r\nThe film shows us a type of family life that, for us in the West, is far from being understandable. It could only take place in strongly patriarchal societies, where the role of women is more than subordinate. It's not a great film, but it's frankly decent, and I don't rule out the likelihood that it's a classic of Chinese cinema (experts will opine better).\r\n\r\nGong Li does a very good job in the role of the young Song Lian, and is very well supported by Saifei He, Cuifen Cao, Lin Kong and Qi Zhao. Jingwu Ma doesn't do an inferior job either, in the role of the patriarch and husband of all those wives. The cinematography is very good, as are the costumes and sets, which take us back in time and geography. What prevented the film, perhaps, from being a greater success in the West was the lack of publicity and the difficulty in adapting to the environment of the film, which is very different from the cinema that Hollywood usually exports: it is much more meditative, passive and depressive than most of the cinema we used to see."], [], ["I could make the joke about this film's title but I don't want to beat a dead horse.\r\n\r\nI had wanted to see this film since it was released in cinemas, but not because I thought it would be good, rather because I live for garbage like this.

It's a Redbox on a bad movie night, or a film your girlfriend wants you to watch with her. Neither situations are true for me, but I'm sure it's happened to someone before. It's a slow first half that just has this lackluster eruption becoming a parody of itself. The last fifteen minutes of this film become a ridiculous set of scenes of 2017.\r\n\r\nIf you're someone who has seen the trailer then you know what is going to happen.

It's \"Leo\" (Marisa Paredes) who has just gone off the boil a bit for her soldier husband \"Paco\" (Imanol Aris) whose career takes him from war zone to war zone with little time for her. What now ensues is a gradual character evolution for this author of romantic fiction who is conflicted by her affection, to an extent, for \"Paco\" whilst realising that that way madness lies and a new life is imperative. Now the thrust of the story is hardly innovative. She has a few character flaws of her own - she does like a bottle or two and to be fair to him, it's not like he has just taken up the military responsibilities he has always had. She also has a mother (Manuela Vargas) who might wear down the best of us, and after a while we begin to need more sustained comedy to help us escape the increasing melodrama. Usually Almodovar is better at providing that, but here - well not quite so much. That said, though, this features an engaging effort from an on-form and lively Paredes and her gay friend \"Angel\" (Juan Echanove) provides an effective foil now and again as this meanders, entertainingly enough, through the women's life of longing, passion and frustration.

When I originally first saw this film I had no clue what it was about but now since seeing it with a better perspective I now know what it's about, I suppose the story in this does work well but this film does have it's problems, I'm not saying this film is bad as it's watchable but it's very plain.\r\n\r\nThe first problem in this film that comes to my mind is the music soundtrack, oh my gosh, talk about the wrong type of music for your film. Having the right music for your film is extremely important and the people that were behind the films musical design got it all completely wrong. In hindsight this is a chase film where the hero is wrongly accused of something he didn't do and is being chased by the police, but the scenes themselves are just \"plain\" and could have been better.

What now ensues is the usual manhunt drama with a truly off-form Brian Cox (\"Collier\") and a slightly more benign \"Shannon\" (Morgan Freeman - not playing the President this time) in hot pursuit. The plot is simple, yet the attempts to introduce red herrings - whom can they trust, etc? - merely serve to clutter it all up. Somebody somewhere decided this couldn't just be an action thriller, it had to have some worthier purpose. Well, I am afraid that just fell flat. Keanu is a handsome man, and in many, many of his roles that carries his somewhat limited acting abilities; well not here and Weisz doesn't really turn up either. That said, the production standards are decent, and there is plenty of action to keep the thing moving along but the formula is tired and I was pretty bored after the first fifteen minutes.

Kurtz would've ended up had he survived the end of \"Apocalypse Now\"? Well, now we know: He exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals \u2014 the horror, the horror.\r\n\r\nThis 1996 version of \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" was such a troubled production that articles, books and documentaries have been made about it, like the 2014 documentary \"Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau.\" Stanley championed the project, wrote the screenplay and was set to direct, but was fired after a few days of filming due to conflicts with Val Kilmer, who wasn't in the best of moods due to being served divorce papers while on set. \r\n\r\nActually that wasn\u2019t the main reason Stanley was fired. He was fine for small indie productions, but he was out of his league with a blockbuster like this. Veteran filmmaker John Frankenheimer was brought in to save the production from being a complete disaster. He got the job done, but his tyrannical approach didn\u2019t help matters. \r\n\r\nThe production was so bad that Fairuza Balk (the cat-lady, Aissa) literally tried to escape the set, but was caught at the airport in the nick of time. Add to this Brando's well-known eccentricities, not helped by the recent suicide of his daughter, Cheyenne, and constant rewrites and you have a formula for a cinematic chaos!\r\n\r\nIn light of the horrible production and the ensuing bad press you would think this would be a lousy movie, but it's actually not THAT bad. I can see why some people don't like it because parts of the third act are pretty crazy and don't flow very well, but if you're a sucker for lost-on-an-island type yarns and appreciate the mood & insanity of films like \"Apocalypse Now\" and the original \"Planet of the Apes\" (\"It's a madhouse, a MADHOUSE!\") you'll probably appreciate some of it. Don't get me wrong, it's nowhere near the caliber of either of those films, but comparisons are inevitable and there are entertaining bits.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that the story isn't that compelling; the flow of the movie is off, which is mostly apparent in the mounting craziness of the final third, which tempts the viewer to tune out. \r\n\r\nThankfully, there are some positives. The title sequence is kinetic and dazzling; the score by Gary Chang is varied and all-around phenomenal; the plot is intriguing; the humanimal make-up and actors are quite good with Daniel Rigney's 'Hyena-Swine' standing out (Rigney would be dead a mere year after the film's release); there\u2019s some creative pizazz, like Marlon Brando's 35-minute stint where he\u2019s as captivating as always, albeit a fat bastage; the inclusion of Dr. Moreau's \"Mini-Me\" is hilarious in hindsight of the Austin Powers trilogy; and there are flashes of nigh greatness, like Edward's revelatory talk with Aissa in the third act.\r\n\r\nMarlon's Dr. Moreau is a variation of Kurtz, i.e. nutjob in the jungle, albeit twenty years later. For Brando fans it's enjoyable seeing him in his old age. This was one of his final films and it shows that he had his magnetic charm \u2019til the end.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are some interesting themes: The humanimals who get to live in Dr. Moreau's abode are more human-like in appearance than the animals living in the smelly humanimal 'village' in the forest; the most human-like one, Aissa, he even refers to as his daughter. Wouldn't this lead to tensions between the factions? Moreover, while Moreau is a benevolent dictator he's still a dictator and dictators are rarely good. When Hyena-Swine usurps the crown he immediately becomes a malevolent dictator.\r\n\r\nThe original version runs 96 minutes and the DC 99 minutes. The film was shot in Cairns, Queensland, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+\r\n", "Rumors about The Island of Dr. Moreau\u2019s suckage have been greatly exaggerated. The real problem with this film isn't so much that it's bad, but that it's not nearly as good as it should be considering the actors involved; on the other hand, it is precisely these individuals (and none more than Marlon Brando) who barely manage to save, perhaps even in spite of themselves, this particular island from sinking to the bottom of the sea. \r\n\r\nBrando invariably was the best thing about his good films, and the only good thing about the bad ones \u2014 this one is no exception; indeed, his portrayal of the titular scientist is one of the ways this version is superior to that of 1977. For all its flaws, I would go so far as to say that this is the best possible film of The Island of Dr. Moreau.\r\n\r\nWhether by design or accident, Brando turns the weirdness all the way up to 11 \u2014 at one point, for example, wearing a \u201ccaloric converter\u201d into which Fairuza Balk pours chunks of ice \u2014, which is exactly what the role requires: the good doctor can never be anything other than the maddest of mad scientists.\r\n\r\nWhen David Thewlis asks him whether \u201chas it ever occurred to you that you might have totally lost my mind? I mean, this is just satanic\u201d, the implicit, tacit answer is no \u2014 of course such a thing has never occurred to him, because lunacy has so absolutely taken over him that sanity and insanity are now one and the same thing. Brando\u2019s Moreau is essentially a Kurtz whom \"the horror\" is no longer capable of horrifying.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the issues Francis Ford Coppola faced while filming Apocalypse Now \u2014 recounted in the documentary Hearts of Darkness \u2014, including how to get the most out of Brando, make Moreau '96\u2019s vaunted troublesome shooting feel like a picnic in comparison. Coppola somehow managed to create one of the greatest films in history \u2014 but then he is Coppola one of the greatest director/screenwriters, something John Frankenheimer will never be accused.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, it's possible that Moreau '96 would have done much better with lesser-known and even less talented actors; this is a visual story, after all, and the key is to reflect on screen the images that H.G. Wells brought to the page. \r\n\r\nThe most important thing here is the spectacle, and this is why Brando rises above the material: because he does not have or does not know the fear of making a spectacle of himself, equal to or even more grotesque than Dr. Moreau\u2019s creations."], ["My expectations for <em>'First Kid'</em> were very low, in that regard it's actually marginally better than I thought it would be.

All of the others aren't worth mentioning, though it is cool to see Rafiki himself, Robert Guillaume, make an appearance - I didn't actually know what he looked like before watching, but in one of his early scenes he laughs and I knew instantly it was that man.\r\n\r\nThe plot is what lets this down. Just a quick glance at the cover gives off negative vibes, while the opening few scenes don't give you any more confidence either. It's extremely predictable, as well as being rather messy - you don't see the villain until the final 20-25 minutes, so are waiting for around 70mins for the obvious to come to fruition.\r\n\r\nI've seen worse from live-action Disney, but it's still a poor attempt from the studio."], [], [], [], ["Land of bloody hope and glory eh!\r\n\r\nGrimley Colliery Brass Band has been going for nigh on a century, but as the town's colliery itself comes under threat of closure due to the drawn out miners strikes, so does the bands very own survival.

The other two of course are The Full Monty (1997) and Billy Elliot (2000), of which Brassed Off is essentially an appetiser of sorts, the warm up act for the big hitters so to speak. Not to say that Brassed Off is not worthy to sit alongside those well received pictures (home and abroad as they say), it most certainly is, it's just that its blend of humour and strife doesn't find any easy ground, thus making it hard for the undiscerning viewer to be at ease at the right moments. It is in short, unsure of what it primarily wants to be. The humour does work well tho, but it's in the dramatic core of the miners strikes, and the affects they have on the denizens of this quaint colliery town, that Brassed Off truly works, with some scenes literally tugging away at the old heart strings. Then there be the music itself, The Grimethorpe Colliery Band {on whose real life story this film is based} provide the music for the soundtrack, and its most enjoyable, often stirring, and definitely poignant at crucial moments.\r\n\r\nThe cast are tremendous, Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald offer up splendid youthful heart, but they are playing second fiddle (or should that be third brass section?) to Pete Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. As father and son, Postlethwaite and Tompkinson give the film its deep emotional being, each driven by differing needs, Brassed Off's success rests with both men being able to hold the viewers attention from the get go. Tompkinson has made a very profitable and thriving career in British Television, and rightly so, but it remains criminal that he didn't go on and make more well known and profitable full length feature films after his fabulous turn here. Filmed in the ideal Northern English town of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, Brassed Off is a film that has evident problems, but to someone like me, a Brit who lived thru those depressing days under Margaret Thatcher's government, it's a film that I love for a myriad of reasons, one can only hope that one of those reasons strikes a chord with yourselves.\r\n\r\nA completely biased 9/10 from me!", "A touching drama of a declining mining community in Margaret Thatcher's Britain.

She doesn't please everyone (nobody pleases everyone) but it is still a reference in 20th century music. Owner of a record that is hard to match, she has several awards, several Grammys and two stars on the Walk of Fame, among other honors. The film we have here, heavily based on the singer's autobiography, shows us a little of her personal life, how she became famous and her difficult marriage to Ike Turner.\r\n\r\nI never read the original book, but I believe the movie omits a lot of information and data to try to focus on the main thing. Brian Gibson ensures an efficient direction and the script is quite good, mainly because of the way it sticks to the story and facts, avoiding melodramas and cloying sentimentality. Of course, not everything goes smoothly: the film is quite predictable, and its pace, although pleasant, goes through several bumps that are basically musical pauses.\r\n\r\nThe most relevant point in favor of this film is the excellent choice of the cast and the impeccable way in which it acts. Lawrence Fishburne has the difficult task of bringing the truculent Ike to life (and there aren't many characters more disgusting than an abusive husband), but he put in such effort that he manages to capture our attention with magnificent charisma. Beside her, the great Angela Bassett never seemed so powerful and electrifying. Incidentally, the resemblance of the two actors to the real figures they embody is truly remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe film has excellent cinematography and good scenery. The costumes, props and even automobiles play an important role in building the atmosphere of the time in which things are happening (between the 50s and the beginning of the 80s).

It's rare to find a film that works on all levels, as a comedy, a thriller and a romance. But thanks to the astute direction from Donen, Charade comes up trumps whilst also oozing an elegant sheen about it. That Grant & Hepburn have charisma in abundance is something of a given, but they are given a quality script to work from and a Hitchcockian plot to revel in. It has been said from some critical quarters that there is no peril in Charade, thus its reputation is not entirely lived up to. Yes we can say it's a playful movie, but it's meant to be, pretty much like \"North By Northwest\" is. Yet the peril exists, lest we forget a great rooftop fight and the last quarter of the movie as we follow our hurried protagonists through the Parisian underground - and on to a memorable encounter at a theatre. Or what about a metal handed George Kennedy putting the pressure on, or James Coburn menacingly playing with matches? No peril my eye!. \r\n\r\nThere's also been the odd dissenting voice proclaiming the structure of the story to be confused. Well it's very twisty, delightfully so, but nothing to tax the brain. Everything is laid out in simple terms and all dialogue is spoken nice and crisply. All played out amongst the splendid back drop of Paris. This was the first and only time that Hepburn & Grant appeared together. A crying shame, for in spite of Grant worrying about the age gap before hand (Grant 59/Hepburn 34), to the extent he requested some dialogue changes to make Regina the romantic pursuer, their chemistry sparkles and they make a very believable coupling. Coburn, Kennedy & Glass are effective bad boys, while Matthau is a key presence throughout. Stylish, charming, suave and suspenseful, with an ending that's truly a pleasant surprise - both in revelation and character closure, Charade is not to be missed by anyone who likes a bit of comedy, romance and thrills in their respective movie diets. 9/10", "Audrey Hepburn's acting is simply lovely and her clothes gorgeous. I loved the way old movies were made, simple, slow passed, no running around or blowing entire buildings, just the old way of telling stories. This way I got to meet all characters, like them, laugh at them and be happy with their ending. And Regina is such an elegant, feminine, brave lady that I'd hoped to be when older. In sum a wonderful movie.", "**Style, class, elegance, an intriguing mystery and a pleasant game of lies and half-truths in a film that deserves to be considered a great classic.**\r\n\r\nSome say this movie is the best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made, and it's true. The iconic director didn't make this film, he wasn't even connected to the production, but his influence and style are very present here. The director, Stanley Donan, may possibly have been fond of the master. Maybe, I don't know. It doesn't matter, the director does a good job and the movie is good.\r\n\r\nThe center of the film is the murder of a man who leaves a young wife bankrupt when she used to live a luxurious life. In the following days, she discovers that her husband was not who he claimed to be, and that he was probably killed because of his own greed: after all, he had appropriated a huge amount of money stolen years before by himself and three other accomplices who will want their share now. Meanwhile, she is also contacted by the CIA and an agile, sly gentleman, who may also be unreliable. By the way, in this film, it is really difficult to know who is telling the truth.\r\n\r\nThe film has all the makings of a great classic, and is a regular on a number of television channels dedicated to old and classic films. It is also considered one of the best in the career of most of the actors involved. The production values are also excellent, and there is a good deal of money in the film: many exterior scenes in recognizable filming locations take advantage of the best that the always elegant Paris has to offer us, from its cathedral to the beauty of the Seine River. The cinematography deserves a close look: there is nothing ingenious, but is done with a lot of talent and technical competence. And the soundtrack? Magnificent.\r\n\r\nAs always happens, Audrey Hepburn gives us another character full of charm and style, with an aristocratic bearing that the costumes, by Givenchy (her personal friend), emphasize even more. She was, then, experiencing the greatest moment of her artistic career, and reaping the fruits of success. Beside her, the unmistakable figure of Carey Grant gives us a friendly face, full of seriousness and credibility attested by his austere appearance, the gray hair and the decent look of the actor and his character, who is not as serious as he might seem. They make an excellent harmonization of opposites: she is young, and he is mature, he is intelligent, and she is more emotional, he is sentimentally more rational and thoughtful, she is impulsive and lets things happen, she wants to believe and trust him, he does not give her a single reasonable guarantee of trust. We also have a solid supporting cast that includes Walter Matthau, James Coburn, Jacques Marin and George Kennedy.", "This is a corker of a romantic thriller with both Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn at the top of their game. When her husband is found murdered by the railway line, \"Reggie\" soon discovers that he wasn't quite the man she had though - Walter Matthau (\"Bartholomew\") convinces her that he was on the run from the US Government with an huge stash of gold. Enter James Coburn; George Kennedy and Ned Glass who begin to cajole, intimidate and downright threaten her determined to obtain the stash. Grant - her knight in shining armour steps in to protect her from these avaricious hoodlums and the shenanigans begin. Stanley Donen really does get the best from everyone in this gripping, witty and stylishly sexy drama. The writing is subtle and nuanced - we have a thriller in which there is virtually no actual menace, but it still twists and turns and nobody is ever whom they seem/say, The characterisations are engaging, the ending is clever, fun and well worth enjoying again 60 years later."], ["These continuing adventures for 'Tod\" and \"Copper\" are really only an excuse for some toe-tapping country and western musical numbers. The story is really neither here nor there. Travelling around, they alight on a band who take a bit of a shine to \"Copper\" and perhaps the big time looms? This puts a strain on the friendship - especially with the \"Grand Ole Opry\" beckoning and the pair spending less and less time together. Can \"Tod\" make his friend realise it's all a pipe-dream? Or perhaps it isn't - maybe \"Copper\" is destined for stardom? The animation focusses almost entirely on the speaking characters and that leaves the background looking very static and two-dimensional. The fairground scene isn't any better than the one in \"Mary Poppins\" from more than forty years earlier and the characterisations rely much too heavily on the songs. It's a straight to video exercise, this - the kids might enjoy it once, but I doubt it needs to be watched twice by anyone."], ["Introspective story with a good Jean Reno and innocent Rosanna Arquette.\r\n\r\nSound track, for those loving Eric Sierra. Not for all tastes. A little bit too long but entartaining.", "**A film unjustly forgotten these days.**\r\n\r\nI confess that I didn't quite know what to expect from this movie. All I knew was that it was wildly successful in the decade it was released, and that nowadays hardly anyone remembers it. It is directed by Luc Besson, a French director whom I respect and consider competent.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is based on the relationship between Jacques and Enzo (I assume one will be French and the other Italian). They are childhood friends, but grow apart shortly after the accidental death of Jacques' father. Already in adult life, the two become apnea diving champions and rivals for the world title of the specialty. The story works reasonably well, but it skids a lot on the amorous subplot created around the character of Johana Baker, which feels very underwritten.\r\n\r\nThe film has a strong French cast led effectively by Jean Reno, who is one of the best French actors working today, at least for me. He gives his character a dour humor and a certain sassiness that I felt was very fitting. Jean-Marc Barr also does a good job, but he lacks Reno's charisma and presence. Rosanna Arquette is beautiful, elegant, but nothing more than a pretty face for the film. The material she received is downright poor.\r\n\r\nLuc Besson likes the sea, and films where the cinematography and the soundtrack artistically dominate and absorb our senses. With this film, he gives us all that, in generous doses, thanks to the beauty of the Mediterranean Sea, magnificently filmed in superb scenes, below and above the water level, and to an excellent soundtrack, by Eric Serra. The editing was also very well directed and the film has a very pleasant pace. All of these are reasons to revisit and revalue a film that seems to me to be unfairly forgotten."], ["Back in the day 2 of the many superstars from in living color. This movie cracks me up so much. My favorite is when he's doing impressions during a sex scene. really hilarious raunchy comedy."], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["Box office $ 5.5 million\r\n\r\nThis was the first time I saw a movie that had nothing close to a human antagonist, yet it kept me glued to the screen. Sure I've read a few novels of the kind but surely they weren't \"oh I'm glued\" stuff. Everybody at least once in their life dreams of something like this and this movie makes it believable. After watching the movie I really thought that Ethan & Julie must have dated 'cause their conversations were just flowing. Definitely a must see.", "**A very simple but very human film, with very good feelings and dialogue.**\r\n\r\nContrary to what I like to do, I saw this film after seeing its sequel, \u201cBefore Sundown\u201d. It's a very nice story about an American tourist who is enchanted by a French student he meets on the train on the way to Vienna, and invites her to spend some time with him. The rest of the film is an intense dialogue between the two through the streets of the city, as emotions and feelings develop.\r\n\r\nThe best thing this film has to offer is the surprising and intensely credible interpretation of the main actors. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are both young, elegant and seem to make a nice couple (of course, the characters, not the actors). I don't know if I'm the only person to think this way, but it seems like the actors felt what the characters were feeling, to the extent that there was sympathy or mutual understanding between the two professionals, and a chemistry that permeated entirely to us. .\r\n\r\nDirected and written with great skill by Richard Linklater, the film can summarize the first meetings of many young couples out there, and I have no doubt that there are many people who will easily identify with the two characters. Who has never chatted with someone cute on a train or bus? There are friendships that start like this, and I myself have a similar case in my life: I have a friend that I value very much, who is blind and who I met by chance on the train, helping her to sit down on more than one occasion (we were both regular travelers due to work).

I dare not watch this again. For some reason it was playing at a dingy burlesque-haunted cinema on old Granville Street in Vancouver on a Sunday afternoon in 1993 where wasted men usually shuffle in to deposit their sperm. (Not enough credit goes to internet porn for cleaning up the streets). Richard Linkater wasn't a story at the time. The guy who made Slackers. The bastard love child of Jim Jarmusch and Chrissie Hynde for all I knew. No clue he'd be the chosen one to eventually deliver us to _Boyhood_. I went in with a friend on a lark and floated out on a psilocybin cloud of joy. I was awestruck. I know these guys! I wanted to endlessly sing its praises but my friend didn't get the same charge out of it. (Although months later at a Christmas party of wayward misfits, he couldn't stop playing the sound track). Maybe it was me. But this was exactly how I remembered High School in the 70's. Was I hallucinating the whole thing? Indeed I was stoned much of the time, but all that was brilliantly accounted for. All that was missing was a bit of Pink Floyd and a whole lot of Led Zeppelin as alluded to in the title. _Dazed & Confused_ isn't merely the best movie about High School in the 1970's. It is the best movie about High School, and the best movie about the 1970's, and perhaps the best movie about male adolescence (yes, yes, IMHO, of course, what else). I dare not watch it again for what if I burst the bubble of such virgin memories to forever spoil my love and admiration for it. Or was it the dingy cinema I have fond nostalgic feelings for? Something. I'll have to watch it again, probably soon, once Linklater finally gets the grand red-carpet treatment along with the golden trinkets he so long deserves.", "Really solid sophomore effort by Linklater.\r\n\r\nLoved his Hitchcock homage, especially.", "**The final day of the school, but it's just the beginning!**\r\n\r\nI won't lie that I watched it after I saw 'Everybody Wants Some!!' from the same director. Because I liked that film and I heard that was a spiritual sequel to this one. So there goes my reason. I usually love the 80s and 90s teen films, you can't compare them to what they make now. The film was from the edge of before my generation began, but I'm very related that time than the other end. So I felt very familiar and enjoyed it thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe film focused on the final day of the high school. It opened in the afternoon during the final class and followed by night where a party was arranged by the seniors that does not take off after their parents suspected it. Between the freshmen and the seniors, a tradition follows. Some of them escape, but those who got caught, struggles to way out. Not everyone, some make it their best time in high school. So who gets what and how everyone's night turns out revealed in the remaining.\r\n\r\nWe can see some of the big names of the today's cinema in this 23 year old film. Matthew McCanaughey, Milla Jovovich, Ben Affleck and many more. Though the film never focused one particular character, it was neutral and stayed that way till the end. But it told the story of the final day of the high school about the individuals and their intentions. You do not have to be a youngster to enjoy it, it will work for everybody. So I hope you watch it, especially before to try 'Everybody Wants Some'.\r\n\r\n_7/10_", "**_The last day of school in 1976_**\r\n\r\nIn the Austin, Texas, area, several youths complete their last day at school and celebrate through the night.\r\n\r\n\"Dazed and Confused\" failed at the box office in 1993-94, but has gone on to achieve a deserved cult status. It's one of the best high school comedy-dramas, along with \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" (1982). The difference between these two is that \"Fast Times\" contains more goofy antics whereas \"Dazed\" is more of a docudrama with amusing flashes. In other words, although \"Fast Times is generally realistic, excepting the over-the-top parts with Spicoli, \"Dazed and Confused\" is more like a slice from real life.\r\n\r\nWhat makes \"Dazed\" work so well is that it gets the LOOK of the mid-to-late 70s just right, particularly the hair & clothing styles, although Slater (Rory Cochrane) seems like a nod to 90's grunge.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the actors pull off the material. A large part of the film's success is the excellent casting choices. You get a few up-and-comers here: Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich and Ben Affleck, along with one or two of lesser note (in regards to future success), e.g. Jason London and Parker Posey.\r\n\r\nAll the standard school archetypes are present: the jock who parties on the side, the bullies, the hot sister and her little long-haired brother, the black dude, the sexy Lib teacher, the streetfighter, the cool guys, the geekier crowd, the babes, the guy who graduated years ago but still hangs around, the mentors & mentees, etc.\r\n\r\nThen you have the standard school experiences like setting up parties at a friend's houses when the parents are away, keg parties, running from bullies, dealing with coaches & teachers, flirting, the possibility of sex, hanging out, meaningless conversations, fights, smoking pot at school or in your friend's bedroom, etc.\r\n\r\nLike \"Fast Times,\" \"Dazed and Confused\" is a joy to watch because it successfully takes you back to the high school years with all its joys & agonies.\r\n\r\nSome don't like it because it's more of a slice-of-life than a plot-driven, contrived story. The plot here is simple: It's the last day of school and the youths want to celebrate. If they can't do it at their friend's house they'll find a place at a park or local hangout, but they WILL party. The rest of the film involves their interactions within this context.\r\n\r\nI've heard some complain that the movie conveys a terrible message. What message? There is no message. The message is that school's out and it's time to celebrate! Besides, there are a few positive points that can be mined from the proceedings: the arrogant bully gets what's coming, make a stand and fight when you have to (even if you get beat up), ultra-tight pants must be put on with pliers, be true to yourself, etc. But, really, this isn't a flick to look for deep messages, its simple purpose is to take you back to the school years (in this case, 1976) and all the fun & pain thereof.\r\n\r\nAside from those already mentioned, Michelle Burke stands out on the female front as Jodi, along with Joey Lauren Adams as Simone (she has such a beautiful, soothing voice). Then there's redhead Marissa Ribisi as Cynthia.\r\n\r\nNo review of \"Dazed and Confused\" would be complete without noting the excellent soundtrack. You get some great rock/metal of the 70s like \"Sweet Emotion,\" \"School's Out,\" \"Stranglehold,\" \"Do You Feel Like We Do,\" \"Love Hurts,\" \"Paranoid,\" \"Rock & Roll Hootchie Coo,\" \"Rock & Roll All Nite,\" \"Slow Ride,\" \"Cherry Bomb,\" \"Tuesday's Gone\" and many more.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot in the Austin, Texas, area.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-", "**A nostalgic film, aimed at those who lived through that time and those experiences, but which was not intended for other audiences and ended up fatally forgotten.**\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what Richard Linklater was thinking when he decided to make a comedy film about the last day of school for a group of teenagers in 1976. I've never lived in the US, but I've noticed that American culture gives a big relevance to High School, and that these educational institutions are very different from their counterparts in my country. Around here, this level of education is just an antechamber with two exits: the job market, with all its hardships, and University. Perhaps Linklater was nostalgic about his own teenage past? If that's the case, I completely understand him, even if I don't really miss my time at High School.\r\n\r\nThe script is based on the nonsense of teenagers, which correspond to the stereotype that we always find in teen movies: they want alcohol, drugs, sex and the perverse fun that comes from pranks done, in a more or less consensual way, to freshmen. This will work very well with teenagers. For other audiences, it's debatable. And since today's audiences don't find it amusing to see a film where a group of teenagers is looking to get drunk, high or have sex, I understand why this film has fallen into oblivion, where it perhaps deserves to remain.\r\n\r\nThe big point where this film manages, somehow, to have value, is the professional and very focused way in which most of the cast worked. Despite being a weak film, there is no doubt that it represented an opening of doors for the careers of many of the actors. Matthew McConaughey is a clear case: this film was the film debut of the actor who, many years later, would win an Oscar for \u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d. Ben Affleck is another similar case: the actor had done some minor work, mostly for TV, before entering this film. Mila Jovovich, actress and model, also didn't have a notable career before this film. In addition to these names, the film features actors such as Jason London, Adam Goldberg, Rory Cochrane and Wiley Wiggins.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film only stands out for the quality of its soundtrack, which brings together a kind of collection of great songs from the late 70s. Nostalgics will smile and recognize Bob Dylan, Alice Cooper, KISS, Aerosmith etc., names that we still consider illustrious today, with songs that almost everyone knows. But let's be frank: a lot of good actors, an excellent soundtrack and a massive dose of nostalgia are enough to turn this film into something really worthwhile? Personally, I don't think so."], [], ["**Based on a somewhat controversial novel, it tackles gender issues and other deep subjects quite well.**\r\n\r\n\u201cOrlando\u201d is perhaps one of the most interesting and controversial novels by the equally controversial Virginia Woolf. The details of this writer's life are known: the sexual abuse she suffered in childhood, the depressive crises, the existential doubts she experienced all her life, her bisexuality. And \u201cOrlando\u201d was born in this context: it is the result of the relationship between Woolf and Victoria Sackville West, an aristocrat who maintained an open marriage, in which she could live her sexuality with other women. To what extent have Victoria or the author herself, at certain moments, not wanted or fantasized about an eventual sex change? I don't know, however, I assume that Woolf's novel may be one of the first literary works to explore the possibility of transsexuality.\r\n\r\nThe film doesn't do much more than transport Woolf's words to the screen, recreating a story where a young androgynous English aristocrat of the Elizabethan court, Lord Orlando, finds himself the object of the affection of the old queen, who gives him various goods and perks. on condition that he can never grow old or die, which actually happens! Thus, \u201cblessed\u201d (the eventual negative consequences are never addressed) in this way, Orlando crosses the centuries without aging a day, lives in love and gets to know other countries. At one point, he is possessed by a sleep he cannot wake up from, and when he finally wakes up, he has mysteriously become a woman, and spends the next two hundred years proving that not only did he never die, he changed sex. And the years go by, with the film ending in our days.\r\n\r\nThe film is responsible for boosting the film career of Tilda Swinton, a British actress who, even before making this film, was already pursuing a somewhat androgynous aesthetic look, perhaps due to having spent her childhood as the only girl among several male brothers. . The truth is that the film contributed decisively to the actress's career. She dominates the film and gives us a superb performance. John Wood and Quentin Crisp also do great value work.\r\n\r\nTechnically, what stands out the most about this film is the cinematography, very careful and beautiful, and the smooth but consistent pace of a film that can take a while to convince viewers, but manages to do it and keeps our attention until at end. Filmed largely on British soil, it makes good use of various aristocratic houses as part of its set, and all the costumes, for each historical era, were really well done.", "Tilda Swinton is superb in this story of the eponymous Tudor noble who obeys a command from the enamoured Queen Elizabeth (Quentin Crisp) and refuses to grow old. The film now follows the adventures, loves and ultimately depicts how the character adapts - quite literally - as England becomes Britain and eventually he becomes free! The experiences as an ambassador in the middle east, the determination to retain the family property when the authorities begin to smell a rat, the arrival of a child - all build upon this wonderfully enigmatic Virginia Woolf creation that defies typical analysis. This is story of humanity and of it's own reluctance to embrace meaningful change as events and the environment relentlessly changes around it. Historical figures from Othello to King James I appear throughout this quirkily engaging chronology that is colourful, vibrant and enjoyably imaginative with this particular adaptation taking a little liberty with the book by extending the timeline into the more modern era. Whilst \"Orlando\" may evolve with some Hermaphroditic characteristics, they serve as a conduit to this story and are not overtly central to the action. It's that very gender ambiguity that becomes gradually better defined as if the immortal is emerging from a fog - and Sally Potter keeps that remarkably well focused for the ninety minutes of screen time we are presented with here. It is an hard film to evaluate, it may or will mean many different things to many different people, and that's what makes it very watchable indeed."], [], [], [], ["Despite the presence of Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire, I think this film actually belongs to Kay Thompson. She plays really well as the 1950s version of Dame Anna Wintour in this amiable, if a little thinly spread, musical comedy. Infuriated by the rather drab quality of her latest \"Quality\" magazine, she determines to revamp the whole thing. In pink! A bookshop being used for a photo shoot by \"Avery\" (Astaire) provides the unlikely source for her new model - \"Jo\" (Hepburn) who is to the fashion industry what Herod was to babies. \"Avery\" is clever, though, and he offers a trade off that sees her do a shoot in Paris in return for a meeting with \"Prof. Flostre\" (Michel Auclair). What now ensues is all fairly predictable, a love triangle with \"Jo\" in the middle vacillating. George & Ira Gerschwin provided the musical numbers, and though they are very well staged, the film lacks a killer song. That said, Thompson is on super form as the no-nonsense boss, the dance numbers are colourful and energetic and finally, Hepburn has a lovely vivacity and enthusiasm to her performance - she takes to the musical numbers very much like a duck to water. Astaire isn't at his best, and Robert Flemyng's accent isn't the best either - but at the end, the whole thing falls into place with an enjoyable certainty."], [], ["This is a splendid telling of Frances Hodgson Burnett's literal tale of rags to riches.

The premiss of vengeance here ought to have provided for a more robust framework for this drama, but sadly the direction meanders and the film quickly loses the pace is starts with. There is a convincing vulnerability to Miss Field's performance, she plays the desperate mother well. Harris and Sutherland, however, feature far too sparingly with the latter simply failing to inject any menace into the proposition.

Everywhere Bobby and Amanda run, the killer is close behind, until the film reveals the true members behind the conspiracy- about an hour after the viewer has figured it out.\r\n\r\nThis had the makings of a first class political suspenser along the lines of \"The Manchurian Candidate\" or \"Seven Days in May.\" In addition to the cast mentioned above, check out some more names from the end credits: Charles Cioffi, Nicholas Turturro, Theodore Bikel, Gore Vidal, Paul Gleason, and Terry O'Quinn. If their names are not familiar, their faces will be. This kind of experienced cast, and writer Vidal, should have known better.\r\n\r\nThe script is nothing more than Hamilton and Sheen running around Washington, D. C. locations while Lang shoots at them with more ammo than Rambo's gun cabinet- and misses. Incredible holes abound in the screenplay: ace reporter Amanda's first question at a White House press conference is asked as she struts down the press corps room aisle like she was being shown to her seat at a Mets game. Even though she is a top reporter at a big D. C. paper, she has no idea the professor and others have been killed in a giant gun fight in the middle of Georgetown. Bobby and Amanda sneak into the White House, where apparently the Chief of Staff feels no need to lock his office doors. Bobby almost has the entire conspiracy recorded on tape...until he drops the evidence in the river. The finale involves the assassination of a major political figure using a remote control toy. Cosmatos shoots a crisp picture here, but he goes overboard on closeups, and matte shots- where one subject is close to the camera, there is some blurriness in the middle of the screen, and the background subject is also in focus. The music sounds like the incidental score to \"Star Wars.\" In the face of all this goofiness, the cast is lost. Sheen enters every scene out of breath. Gazzara is so grizzled as the vice-president, I cannot imagine him on any political ticket- he makes Joe Biden and Dick Cheney appear cuddly. Waterston is vacuous as the president, why Bobby chooses to remain loyal to him is beyond me. Stephen Lang is so much better than given credit for, but he can do nothing with a bad role. \"Shadow Conspiracy\" is so serious in its intentions, it turns into an unintentional comedy.

Jason Patric is really quite good as the liaison officer who is charged with escorting Geronimo to a meeting with the government, epitomised by Gene Hackman as \"General Crook\" who is a measured, considerate soldier who appreciates, and has some sympathy with, their plight. During this journey, the two men start to form a bond based on their respective senses of honour and fairness; courage and trust. This all becomes sorely tested when \"Crook\" is succeeded by Kevin Tighe who is not so sympathetic and they now have a revolution to deal with. It has some wonderfully full and grand cinematography, Ry Cooder has created a suitably splendid accompaniment but Matt Damon's rather preppie narration and, indeed, the whole script is way too wordy when we have such characterisations and images to digest.It is far too sanitised to offer a serious critique into the atrocities carried out in the name of progress, so really joust boiled down to an over-long wetter with little eastern promise."], ["**A pessimistic film, somewhat negative and sad, about (maybe) two versions of the same person.**\r\n\r\nI decided to see this film shortly after having seen the trilogy of colors, by the same director, the Polish Krzysztof Kieslowski. The theme of the film is the lives of two women, the French Veronique and the Polish Weronika. They are doppelg\u00e4ngers for each other, live similar lives, have very similar aspirations and a similar life path. It could be said that they are twin sisters or versions of the same person! However, the two do not know each other and do not even presume the existence of the other. I dare not \u2013 and it would be very incorrect \u2013 to say more, but what happens to one of them affects the other in an inexplicable way. It is not, however, a happy or optimistic film.\r\n\r\nKieslowski does an interesting job in a film that marks his expansion outside his country, into international cinema. Until then, he had only made a career in Poland, and largely at the expense of national television and documentaries. Color is fundamental in the film, as is the case in a good part of his work, and especially in his famous trilogy. Except that, contrary to what happens in these three films, the colors are largely muted here, through the almost permanent use of filters that reduce them to a tan, almost sepia. Thus, cinematography seeks to speak to us through color and framing, and ends up relating intimately and intensely with music and sound, creating an oneiric atmosphere that only seems excessive due to its omnipresence. Of the soundtrack, I would especially highlight a passage sung, in the best and most honest lyrical or operatic style, but undoubtedly composed for the film.\r\n\r\nThe lead role (or rather, both lead roles) are secured by Irene Jacob, young and confident, sure of herself and her ability for the task at hand.

I bet that even those to whom this has never happened will be able to name some examples: Pharaonic public works that went wrong or never came to fruition in full, private projects and companies that failed because of their own mistakes. There will be no shortage of examples, and I think we can add this film to that list, since the main flaw stems from the ambitions of its creator.\r\n\r\nWim Wenders is one of the great German directors of our time and no one can deny him this merit, not even those who don't really appreciate his style, or who criticize him (with some propriety) for having transformed, in recent years, into that kind of director that he criticized at the beginning of his career. However, what he wanted to do in this film was a task far beyond his capabilities and ingenuity. An epic lasting more than twenty hours that was condensed into a summary of three and a half hours and, years later, partially restored in the form of the \u201cdirector's version\u201d, lasting almost six hours. I made the mistake of trying to see precisely the latter, believing that I was seeing the version closest to the creator's vision. However, what he gives us is so uninteresting and so confusing that I wasted my time.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with the threat of an Indian nuclear satellite, which will crash to earth, and then introduces Claire, a young woman who seems to be looking for a direction in her life in the midst of a futile existence. After a car accident in which she meets two bank robbers, she agrees to take the stolen money to Paris, in exchange for a percentage. In the midst of this, she helps a mysterious man who appears to be fleeing from a murderer and who steals some of her money. Committed to recovering him, she follows him around the world and ends up hiring a private detective.\r\n\r\nAs I believe you can already understand from this summary, the plot is not devoid of good ideas and had potential. With the characters always on the move, traveling the world, the film is not monotonous and has some potential for light comedy (although Wenders' humor is completely German, and we know what that means). However, the film gets lost in constant twists and turns that go nowhere. Circulating from one country to another, the plot wastes hours of our lives in a story without substance or content. Wenders doesn't spare us and gives us long scenes where the characters drive cars, walk or make phone calls. He looks like a five-year-old kid who starts telling his parents the most complicated story just to ask for a toy he saw in a store. This is what ruins the film and makes it unbearable. Oh, and of course, the issue of the falling satellite ends up completely forgotten in all this.\r\n\r\nThe production values are quite good considering it's a European film and the millions from the Hollywood machine are absent from the equation. Wenders managed to create some somewhat futuristic elements such as public telephones with video calling or police motorcycles with a bold and bizarre appearance. The urban settings seem hostile, with all sorts of trash and graffiti. The cinematography is magnificent, and the director makes the most of it, as is usual in the films he makes, but on the other hand, the soundtrack is virtually inaudible and does not add any quality to the final work.\r\n\r\nSolveig Dammartin was a good choice for the main character. She is elegant, and gives her character a special charm throughout the film. Unfortunately, she can't do miracles with the material given to her. Sam Neill also makes the most of the occasion in the best way he can, but the film is far from being one of the best of his career, and the same can be said of William Hurt.

Balderston. It stars Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotton, May Whitty, Barbara Everest and Angela Lansbury. Music is by Bronislaw Kaper and cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg.\r\n\r\nYears after her aunt was murdered in her London home, Paula Alquist Anton (Bergman) moves back there with her new husband, Gregory Anton (Boyer). However, what at first seems to be an idyllic marriage begins to crumble as Paula appears to be losing her mind\u2026\r\n\r\nYou really have to put into context just how great Gaslight is as per the time it was released. For it holds up now as something of a torch igniter for what has followed over the decades. The psychological thriller \u2013 specifically that of a spouse being tormented by their partner \u2013 has been mined for all its worth - and will continue to do so. Even the terminology of very real life instances such as Gaslighted/Gaslighting have been born out from the pic, so if it is thought of being dated or old hat, its influence is still quite considerable.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s still a terrific atmospheric thriller anyway, played out to a magnificent backdrop of Victorian London, of fogs and cobbled streets, and of course gas lights and eerie shadows. Pic is split into two halves, first half is the set-up of a whirlwind romance that leads to marriage, then the move to the marital home and support characters - nosy neighbour (Whitty), housekeeper (Everest), tart housemaid (Lansbury on debut) - are introduced to proceedings. Deft psychological touches are being played out, though wonderfully we never actually see the misdirection machinations actually being done.\r\n\r\nThen as the second half happens upon us it really hits the diabolical straps, the methodical manoeuvres of Gregory Anton really start to gnaw away at our senses. We witness Paula come apart, her mind fractured, so vulnerable and confused, you would have to have a heart of stone not to have your very core ache. It\u2019s here where Bergman, in the first of her three Best Actress Oscar wins, excels without duff histrionics. Boyer also is superb, where guided by the astute Cukor he makes Gregory a dashing dastard, only given to subtle clues about his devious and wicked doings.\r\n\r\nCotton doesn\u2019t try to do a British accent, which is fine as he holds his end up well as Brian Cameron, the man getting to grips with what\u2019s actually going on in the Alton home. Brian is our hero in waiting, giving us something to hang onto as the pic reaches revelations point. With Ruttenberg (Oscar Nominated) drifting what would be known as noirish contrasts over the piece, and Kaper\u2019s music unobtrusively subtle, Gaslight hits high marks for tech credit substance.

The story itself it quite a complex and characterful one, with plenty of twists, turns and perilously placed hypodermic needles, but I found neither Baldwin nor Pullman really exuded much personality and the equally unremarkable Kidman was left to do just a little bit too much of the heavy lifting by herself.

The film is more directly inspired by the old productions of Hammer Studios and Francis Ford Coppola's _Dracula_, which was still recent when the film was released. The script is, therefore, similar in every way to the last film I mentioned.\r\n\r\nNielsen is perfectly capable of putting up with the film effortlessly, with a generous dose of good humor, charisma and spirit. The actor is a veteran of cinema comedies and satire, we've seen him before in very funny films, and the actor does well here again. However, I can agree with those who say that the actor has done better works. In addition to directing, Brooks gives life to Van Helsing and is also resourceful and witty, with a relatively flawless work, but also without major merits. Much better than Brooks was Peter MacNicol's excellent performance in the role of Renfield. The actor is good, and he seems genuinely deranged. Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony do what they can, but they're not particularly happy, because their characters don't really matter here.\r\n\r\nBeing a film that takes place in the Victorian England, it is possible that Brooks gave the cast instructions to try to Britishize their accents. However, such an effort rarely resulted in any happy results, not to mention the jokes, who didn't always work well, with several scenes sounding overly serious or dull. The sets, as well as the costumes, are good enough, and I didn't find any major problems with the question of the historical period.

Crossfire (originaly titled \"Cradle Of Fear\") is a taut and gripping picture that boldly tackles anti-Semitism. Though the makers were forced to tone down the story from the original source, the novel is about homosexual hatred as opposed to anti-Semitism, what remains, largely due to RKO supremo Dore Schary and producer Adrian Scott, is a sort of creeping unease that drips with noirish style.\r\n\r\nThe cast features three Bob's, Young, Mitchum and Ryan, with noir darling Gloria Grahame adding the emotional female heart. Though only third billed, it's Robert Ryan's picture all the way, his portrayal as the bullying, conniving Montgomery is right from the top draw and perfectly showcases the talent that he had in abundance. Ryan had good cause to give Montgomery some of is best work for he had served in the Marine's with Richard Brooks himself, both men having discussed the possibility that if the novel was to be made into a film, then Ryan wanted in and to play Montgomery. Thus the genesis of Ryan's career as weasel types was well and truly born!\r\n\r\nGloria Grahame also puts in a wonderful and heartfelt turn, which is all the more remarkable since she was being plagued by her abusive husband at the time, one Stanley Clements. He was known to be violent towards her and his constant presence around the set irked other members of the cast, but Grahame, probably channelling real life emotion, became the character of Ginny and shone very bright indeed. Both Bob Mitchum and Bob Young come out with flying colours as well, to really seal the deal on what proves to be a smartly acted picture. \r\n\r\nCrossfire was released before the other 1947 anti-Semitic picture, \"Gentleman's Agreement\", and raking in over a million and a quarter dollars at the box office, some of its thunder was stolen by the Academy Award winning picture from Fox Studio.

There are plenty of undercurrents within the plot to keep it interesting - not least homosexuality and anti-Semitism, both hot topics for the \"Code\" at the time, and although it is maybe just a bit too wordy, it is still a remarkably potent mystery that rather courageously attempts to tackle taboos as well as the more routine human frailties.

As often happens among impoverished youth, they divide the rent between them so that they can remain there, and they are looking for a fourth companion because there is still space for another roommate. However, after about a week, the guy they have chosen is found dead next to a huge suitcase full of money. And they are left in a dilemma: should they call the police and tell them everything? After all, they didn't kill him! Or would it be better to hide the body somewhere and keep the money? They really need it\u2026 is it worth it?\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the film explores the themes of greed and pettiness, friendship and the way in which something can transform the way people relate, putting an end to friendships and leading to brutal paranoia that feeds on the unconfessable fears of each one. There's something that reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock here. I believe this would be enough for the film to be interesting, but Boyle added a subplot where a group of criminals knows about the money and are looking for it, leaving a trail of bodies wherever they go. The film didn't need this, and it would have been better to invest in the central plot.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this film is that it is not beautiful nor does it have likable characters. On the contrary! They are petty, cynical, unsympathetic and their friendship seems artificial, forced by circumstances. However, this is exactly what the film could explore to the limit. It tries to do so, the tension gradually increases as this happens, but the sub-plot I mentioned introduces itself blatantly and ruins things a bit.\r\n\r\nIn the cast, Chris Eccleston and Ewan McGregor stand out with inspired and slightly insane performances. Their characters called for this expansiveness and both knew how to rise to the challenge, although they sometimes exaggerated. Kerry Fox is not that good and just exaggerates. Boyle has style, but he is not a director skilled at guiding his cast. In addition, we have Keith Allen, who has very little to do, and Ken Stott, relegated to a secondary position and of no great interest to the plot.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has frankly positive notes: the set is very well-thought-out, with the production looking for every means to cope with the Franciscan poverty of its budget. The cinematography is good, but not enchanting, and the camera work has its moments of creative inspiration, with original perspectives and some unusual framings. The fast pace reasonably covers up the weaknesses, making the film more fun and palatable. The ending is an effort, but the twist was predictable.", "Three flatmates are having some fun recruiting a fourth to share their spacious Glasgow apartment. \"Juliet\" (Kerry Fox) is a doctor; \"Alex\" (Ewan McGregor) is a tabloid journalist and finally \"David\" (Christopher Eccleston) is an accountant. Despite their differences this trio quite effectively rub along together. It's the doc who first meets the enigmatic \"Hugo\" (Keith Allen) who convinces the gang - thanks largely to his large wad of cash - that he is their perfect fit. He disappears into his room and after a few days of radio silence, they have to break down the door for a vision of him dead on a bed with a suitcase full of loot underneath it! Should they call the police or should they do a bit of DIY body disposal and keep it all? That's the premiss as they take the latter route and find themselves amidst a series of increasingly perilous scenarios that will change them and their relationship for ever. Yes, it's totally far-fetched but the characters work well together as the simplicity of their ideal becomes compromised in a sea of mistrust, greed and kitchen knives. It's the understated Miller who steals this for me, and there's a fun contribution from Colin McCredie as their would be sharer \"Cameron\" and Ken Stott's policeman \"McCall\" who has a pretty quirky approach to policing. There are a few plot holes but they don't really matter as this amiably comedic assessment of human nature races along entertainingly for ninety minutes."], [], [], [], ["***Quirky white trash crime spree satire tries too hard***\r\n\r\nA young no-class couple from central Texas (Gil Bellows & Renee Zellweger) flee from loan sharks and a maniac ex-partner (Rory Cochrane), seeking a shotgun wedding and to escape to Mexico.\r\n\r\n\"Love and a .45\" (1994) is a satirical black comedy crime flick inspired by the Charles Starkweather killing spree of January, 1958, who was accompanied by his 14 year-old girlfriend.

By contrast, the contemporaneous \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d didn\u2019t have to try hard; it just was (the real deal; and not shallow at all).

Unfortunately, it's the self same cruise that the belligerent \"Geiger\" (Willem Dafoe) has decided to wreck as he has quite some grudge with the shipping company. With relative ease, he manages to hijack the controls of the liner and set it on a collision course with a fully laden oil tanker. Can \"Alex\" and \"Annie\" thwart this dastardly plan? The story is just preposterous, and the acting talents of Patric would comfortably fit in an already full ashtray. Dafoe offers a reasonable degree of mania with his performance, but Bullock - except for quite a fun scene taking her driving test - takes very much a back seat during most of this rather fanciful yarn.

It is not, however, an easy film: the reliance on dialogues, and the intelligent, almost intellectual, way in which they are conceived, will scare away audiences who are not so willing to tolerate it. For the most part, the film feels a lot like a play or something you'd see in the theater, and that can get a little tiresome.\r\n\r\nWill Smith is the great actor who dominates the film, with a superb performance. It was a film that helped a lot in his artistic career, and that opened the doors for him to better and more recognized works. However, it is still one of the actor's best films so far. We cannot, however, ignore the inspired and successful performance of Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing, in the role of the two millionaire art dealers that Smith so easily deceives. In a more discreet position, Sir Ian McKellen is positively supportive of the main cast.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's a film that doesn't seem to have been very expensive to make, as almost half of the action takes place inside the rich people's apartment, and that all the action seems to have been limited to a relatively small geography. There are no visual or special effects that stand out, the sound has minimal intervention, and the soundtrack consists of songs that we know relatively well and that are cleverly used.

He has crafted a sensitive piece about a hot topic, there's no titillation or firm answers to the problem to hand, and in young Liberato (Annie) and trusty pro Owen (Will), he has actors turning superbly heart aching performances.\r\n\r\nPic follows the trajectory of girl meeting what she thinks is a teenage boy on line, and as she falls for him, the predator slowly begins to unfurl his deception to the point where she's lost, confused and jelly in is hands. Once the \"relationship\" comes to light, the parents are shredded, the strain unbearable, with father Will reacting how any father would.\r\n\r\nThe narrative deals with parental upheaval and that of young Annie, the latter of which is thrust into a world of confusion and hateful attention from her peers. Screenplay dangles other sexual predator strands, without force feeding us, while the denouement is refreshingly sour and not afraid to ask the pertinent question of who do you trust? More so given that these predators are in our midst and often living a false facade of a life.\r\n\r\nA family under duress mingles with the invasion of a monster into their lives, for what is not a comfortable watch, but certainly one well worth digesting. 7/10", "Chilling movie that was pretty uncomfortable to watch but features great performances from Clive Owen and the young Liana Liberato.

Despite being released over ten years ago, the film couldn't be more current today. Our young people and teenagers, who grew up with computers and technologies, face them in such a friendly way that they are often unable to see the dangers they hide. Parents have the thorny mission of imposing limits and rules on their use, of informing and advising... but let's be honest: which teenager is really willing to listen to parents and their rules?\r\n\r\nThe script begins by introducing us to an ordinary, upper-middle class family. While the parents work and the eldest son prepares to enter university, the youngest daughter is trying to integrate into the school's popular girls' circle after making the school volleyball team. She's an ordinary teenager with the insecurities of many other girls... until she starts chatting online with an unknown guy. She realizes he's older, but it's only when they meet in person that she realizes he's already in his thirties. Even so, she continues the relationship and the growing intimacies lead to a sexual involvement, and to a family crisis when the parents discover, and try to find the identity of the seducer, since sexual abuse of minors is, of course, a crime.\r\n\r\nWell, I think I have to start by saying that I've seen, in real life, several cases and situations similar to the one in this movie. It is increasingly common for teenagers to maintain online dating and relationships, often without meeting in person, having more or less spicy conversations through social networks. It's a new form of sexuality that has emerged from the Internet and that can really mess with the head of a more influential girl. And it is not so rare for them to find, by chance, an adult with whom they maintain this type of contact. He may, or may not, tell about the age difference, and they may, or may not, accept it, or even use the situation as a form of rebellion towards their parents. But the fact that it is increasingly common does not mean that it is acceptable. It is a dangerous situation, where young people can get excited and reveal too much of themselves (habits, customs, erotic photos or videos, etc.) to potential sexual predators. These are dangers that can really worry a parent. And a stroll through social networks, such as Instagram or TikTok, is enough to see how teens are exposing themselves. In addition to making a very believable portrayal of a situation that could be real, the film explores well the relational conflicts between teenagers and her parents, and the consequences of what happened in her school, in their friendships, and with herself.\r\n\r\nThe cast is generally good and does a positive job. The director is effective, but not brilliant. The best performances come from the young Liana Liberato, who managed to be convincing in the role and give us a good interpretation, and also from Catherine Keener, very good in the role of a perfectly distressed mother. Clive Owen is good enough, but he doesn't strike me as the best actor for the role, as he made the character overly brutal. Chris Coffey and Jason Clarke's performance is decent, but basic.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is satisfying in that it does everything it needs to do, but it doesn't go beyond that. Cinematography is decent, but not above standard. There are no effects or a really interesting soundtrack, but the editing was well executed."], ["**A film very experimental and devoid of meaning, but with some notes of quality.**\r\n\r\nI didn't like this film. It's a low-budget film, directed by R\u00e9my Belvaux, which basically makes a kind of false documentary around the criminal and violent activities of a cruel and bloodthirsty killer, who accepts being filmed while he kills his victims. A film that looks like an academic work by a film student, and not something made for the public. It will certainly be an interesting film for film students and cinema critics, but it is not something I recommend to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe film has frankly positive points, starting with the excellent performance of Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays the main character and is the only character worthy of the name here. Everything else is extras or people who simply have to appear there. The realism is impressive and, at times, shocking, and the cinematography, in black and white, is very good and worked with creativity by the director.\r\n\r\nThe film's biggest problem is the feeling of amateurism and experimentalism that is felt at various moments. It's also one of those extremely violent films where everything happens without there really being a reason, a reason for being. Much of the film is a succession of violent crimes where there is nothing more than purposeless violence.

Sadly, though, the actors don't really gel - they are four men who seem to be vying for screen time as much as anything else; there is little evidence of a team on screen which rather belies the truth about why this gang were at all successful. It does move a long apace, though - there is plenty of gun action and some fun pyrotechnics as their antics gain momentum and their targets become bigger. Historically, the ending is quite interesting - and I think quite suitable, though I very much doubt the railroad saw it that way.

What now ensues is a really derivative, repetitive and frankly rather dull semi-animated action adventure that rehashes just about every theme in the book and over-relies on the characterisations that are seriously under-delivered by a cast that are simply not up to the task. McDowell just hams it up the whole time and the dialogue is beyond banal. Rachel Talalay could have done so much more with the sort of \"Mad Max\" elements of the story, but instead allows this to just drift into a puerile, attitudinal, drama that offers little to engage and a suite of visual effects that we have seen loads of times before.

Rathbone, a fully fledged trained swordsman gave Power the highest compliment about how well he took to fencing, and it shows as we get epees to the death. The romance sparkles, Sondergaard straight away wants to get into Poewer's pants, Power wants to get into Darnell's pants, while Rathbone will just take what he can while he fondles his sword.\r\n\r\nIt's a pure joy, for kids and adults of all ages, supremely directed by Mamoulian (the control of the 100's of extras at pic's finale is dynamite), and acted with style and knowing skill by the cast.

At its core, this is cinema. However, there are so many films that seek to indoctrinate and convey political or social messages that it is not easy for us to forget that the industrial and propaganda machine linked to the movies is perfect for the mass \u201cbrainwashing\u201d of crowds. It's something I don't like and it's even dangerous, taking into account that it can be used for good or bad, depending on the message being conveyed. And the message that this film sends us is one of tremendous social irresponsibility!\r\n\r\nReleased in 1978, at a time when American cinema still felt the strong influence of hippies and the ideals of a libertarian and counterculture Left, the film begins by revealing two very different characters (a poor Latino and a well-born and spoiled rich man) who unite in their love for drugs, and especially marijuana (or weed). The script is non-existent and underwritten: the characters limit themselves to an incessant and eager search for more and more drugs, ending up returning from Mexico with a van made of weed and leaving a trail of smoke and people accidentally stoned, and apparently very happy with that.\r\n\r\nThe film is one of those films that Hollywood should be ashamed of: it is a great apology for the consumption, liberal and recreational, of a varied cocktail of drugs, which starts with weed and ends with acids, \u201cspeeds\u201d and heroin. The amount of substances mentioned in the film is vast and the way in which the subject is approached should have led to legal actions and arrest warrants against the actors, producers, studio and director, in order to answer for this irresponsible and inconsequential movie. And if the reader finds that too drastic, I leave you the question: would it be reasonable or good that they had released a comedy that made a sympathetic or pleasant portrayal of Nazism, or the Holocaust? Yes, one thing has nothing to do with the other! But there are reasonable limits for everything, including comedy, and there are themes that are simply not meant to make people laugh. I don't mean by this to say that I think the film was instrumental in increasing drug use, or that all the people who saw it went out and bought some weed. But if we, as a society, start to allow certain reprehensible acts and behaviors to be seen in a careless way, this gradually becomes ingrained in people's minds.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this issue of moral and social irresponsibility, the film also has a perfect bad taste humor: I've never seen a film where the characters spend so much time in bathrooms, or vomiting. If that's funny, I didn't see any joke, but maybe it's my mistake, after all, I wasn't born or live in a cave, and my parents gave me a good education. Technically, the only aspects worthy of mention are the vehicles, starting with the VW Beetle modified with Rolls-Royce parts and ending with the very green van that appears in the biggest slice of the film. Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong deserve the Golden Raspberry and are absolutely deplorable, as actors and as comedians.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I am in favor of banning this film, on moral and educational grounds. However, it can even be seen if it is properly framed and accompanied by explanations about the danger of drug use. Lucky for us, there are lots of films with good messages about that, and yes, cannabis is a drug like any other."], ["It must be a drag to be a slave to the male sex drive.\r\n\r\nKeith Nelson, much to everyone else's surprise, lands a date with Amanda Jones, the most popular girl in school.

While things are further complicated by the fact that Keith's best friend Watts is hopelessly in love with him, something that Keith is oblivious too. All roads, rocky or otherwise, are leading to one house party where lives are about to be changed.\r\n\r\nReleased a year after Pretty In Pink, writer John Hughes further cemented his status as the king of teenage angst with this funny, charming and entertaining picture. Following a similar formula to that used in Pretty In Pink, Some Kind Of Wonderful deals not only in young love thematics, but also in opposites breaking down barriers, bullies and the spectre of parental pressure. Keith (Eric Stoltz) is from humble working class stock, the idea of dating the more affluent Amanda (Lea Thompson) would seem idiotic at best. The characters may move in different circles, but Hughes, as is his want, thrusts the issue to the front whilst dangling little strands in the background. Time is given to the father (an impressive John Ashton) and son axis, where career pressure is raised. And the delightful old chestnut of fitting in at school, or not as the case may be as regards Watts (a tremendous and sensual Mary Stuart Masterton) is also putting in an appearance.\r\n\r\nIt's often forgotten in Hughes \"angsty\" films, that they aren't merely love stories for the young and restless. They are all encompassing pieces that hold up better than ever on revisits today. Yes there is pandering to certain expectations, and yes the endings never veer away from a tried and trusted method. But Hughes knew what worked for him and his audience. That he never attempted to insult us (them) with sledgehammer tactics, or trick of the twist dallying, is really rather refreshing when viewing them today. Some Kind Of Wonderful is quite simply a wonderful film, with great comedy (check out the fabulous Elias Koteas) and a banging soundtrack, it ranks as one of the finest efforts crafted from the pen of a very fine writer. 9/10", "***Working class boy, rich dream girl and faithful tomboy friend in Southern Cal***\r\n\r\nKeith (Eric Stoltz) is a high school senior in Los Angeles wherein he fights with his little sister (Maddie Corman) and is pestered by his dad about going to college.

Craig Sheffer plays the rich stud nemesis, Hardy.  \r\n\r\nWriter John Hughes was known for those mid-80\u2019s high school films, like \u201cSixteen Candles,\u201d \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d \u201cPretty in Pink\u201d and \u201cFerris Bueller's Day Off.\u201d Unsuccessful when it was released in 1987, \u201cSome Kind of Wonderful\u201d ended his foray in the genre and he would go on to popular comedies with John Candy and Chevy Chase. \r\n\r\nThis movie is interesting in that it includes elements of \u201cPretty in Pink\u201d (1986) and, indeed, features the ending that was intended for that movie, which the studio forced him to alter. Hughes even wanted Molly Ringwald for the role of Amanda, but she refused and Hughes took it personally, which ended their working relationship.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s about on par with \u201cPretty in Pink,\u201d but I prefer the cast in this one, plus it\u2019s more heartwarming. I\u2019d watch it any day over the overrated \u201cBreakfast Club,\u201d yet it has its issues. For instance, some scenes have the same sense of unreality that marred \u201cPink\u201d and Stoltz strikes me as too confident, charismatic and good-looking for the role of a guy that is rudely ignored by the popular girls. This would\u2019ve never happened at my school, working class or not.    \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-", "After watching this, felt like a reverse version of Pretty in Pink only to find out afterward this was John Hughes's attempt to rectify the ending. I actually enjoyed this a lot more as I found the chemistry with the leads to be better (to me, Lea Thompson is an upgrade over Molly Ringwald). Eric Stoltz was great with both Thompson and Masterson.\r\n\r\nAlso had some fun subversion of expectations, particularly with Elias Koteas' punk character turning out to be an okay guy, plus John Ashton as the father was nice that he just wasn't the stereotypical jackass they tend to be in these teen movies.\r\n\r\nNot sure where this ranks compared with other John Hughes films, but it's a solid entertaining time. **3.75/5**", "**An adorable, cute and melodramatic teen romance.**\r\n\r\nThe film begins with a teenager who stands out for his artistic ability \u2013 he draws well and also paints \u2013 and his love of automobile mechanics. He is not rich and is jealous of his wealthier schoolmates. Is it a problem of lack of self-esteem? Maybe, but things get worse when he falls in love with a beautiful, rich girl with a handsome, rich, stupid boyfriend. From then on, he will use the money his parents saved to pay for college in an attempt to humiliate his rival and impress his beloved, with the help of a friend, a drummer and rocker, who is secretly in love with him.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the film is very moving due to its main message around love, and the way we should value and love those who truly value and love us. This is the main message of the film and what has made it work so well for decades. However, I recognize that teenage rebellion is unpleasant, especially if we are adults and tend to identify with the position of parents, who want the best for their child and know that having higher education, no matter how little it is worth, still helps to open up doors in the job market. The issue is the focal point of the relationship between the main character and her parents, but it goes unnoticed in this film, focused on rose-colored romance.\r\n\r\nIf the film does not strictly stand out for its technical qualities (absolutely the standard of films of this time), it is in the acting and cast that the film bets most safely, casting Eric Stoltz in the main role. He's young enough for the role, but mature enough to give a solid performance. Mary Stuart Masterson also does an excellent job. Much less interesting, because one-dimensional, Lea Thompson and Craig Sheffer do what they can in characters without much juice, while Elias Koteas takes advantage of every opportunity in a supporting role."], [], [], ["This is one of these films that you need to allow quite a bit of latitude, else you will rule it just too implausible and stop watching. John Garfield (\"Johnnie\") is a world champion boxer who finds himself embroiled in the death of a journalist. His problem is, he was totally sozzled after his victory so cannot recall what he did, or didn't, do - so absconds to a remote Arizona ranch where he helps the elderly May Robson who runs a refuge for wayward teenagers. That's where he meets, and falls for \"Peggy\" (Gloria Dickson) and settles down to a respectable life helping teach the boys how to focus their energies on boxing. Thing is, New York plod \"Whelan\" (Claude Rains) is on his case, and soon this newly found utopia is at risk... Garfield does a fitting job here, he is eminently plausible as the flawed prizefighter and his character's evolution as the story develops is engaging too. Rains features sparingly for much of the film, and I found his efforts a little disappointingly constrained when he did appear. The film really, for me anyway, belonged to the \"Dead End Kids\" - playing the best game of strip poker I think I've ever seen in a family movie. It's a bit too long, but has good pace, plenty of action, decent dialogue and the romance is kept to a minimum - well worth a watch."], ["Journalist \"Charles\" (Van Johnson) returns to Paris after a two year absence and takes up his stool in the bar where he begins to reminisce about the reasons that kept him in the city after the end of WWII and of those that eventually drove him away. It all started when he was given a blind kiss on the day of liberation celebrations then later he meets the girl again. \"Helen\" (Elizabeth Taylor). He takes an immediate shine to her just as her sister \"Marion\" (Donna Reed) does to him. He's an aspiring writer and now settled with new, wealthy and party-going, wife and their daughter, he hopes to finish his magnum opus. Along the way he has crises of confidence and takes to the bottle - all putting a strain on his marriage that ends in tragedy. The purpose of his return is now clear, but will it find any traction with those who still remember? Liz Taylor does exude a degree of star quality here, but for then most part this is really a rather unremarkable melodrama that follows a fairly predictable arc of ups and downs before a Parisian showdown that doesn't really burn very brightly. Johnson is adequate here, and there are a few welcome interventions from Walter Pidgeon but otherwise this is all watchable and beautifully shot but forgettable stuff."], ["An Academy Awards Best Picture nominee, this is a very good film that, despite its occasional experimentation and evident striving for greatness, doesn't quite reach the mark it hopes to. Nonetheless, it's unmistakably high quality and remains very watchable, enduringly appealing, and, in places, impressive.\r\n\r\nThe big glaring shortcomings are the experimental moments - which don't work and are distracting - and the fact that Miss Hayes is, much of the time, given over-ripe, unnaturally worded and stagy sounding dialogue to speak - and so much of the time, despite that she does give a fine, clearly talented performance, she does so in stage-performer mode and with \"impress them with my craft\" line delivery, rather than in the much more subtle and truly naturalistic way that's right for movie acting. I'm not faulting Miss Hayes' performance, instead am opining that she gives a stage star's version of subtle movie acting, rather than a movie actor's version thereof.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, all the stagily worded dialogue was given only to Miss Hayes to speak. Other characters are given infinitely more real and believable sounding dialogue. Perhaps Paramount expressly wanted to capitalize on Miss Hayes' stature and deserved reputation as one of the greatest stage stars of her time, therefore ordered script writers to \"pour it on thick\" when it came to lines for her to speak.\r\n\r\nAn additional shortcoming of this film, for me, has always been that I never have found Cooper and Hayes to seem like a credible couple; his chemistry with and towards her seems 100% natural and believable, though her interactions with him always feel, to me, like she's performing, rather than it being convincingly real life-like. I don't mean to sound like I'm faulting Miss Hayes, as she was, as we know, tremendously gifted. Her performance in this movie feels, to me, like it would have been spot-on on the stage. Another issue is that Miss Hayes has always struck me as miscast in this, as she seems neither remotely British nor the irresistible beauty that characters express to one another that she is.\r\n\r\nVery strong points of the movie are the cinematography (winner of the Best Cinematography Oscar), which is superb throughout, particularly throughout the impressive and memorable roughly four minutes exodus to Milan montage; it's outstanding. Too, the sets (nominated for the Best Art Direction Oscar) are marvelous. Also the performances by Cooper, Adolphe Menjou (as Cooper's surgeon best friend Rinaldi), Jack La Rue (as the priest), and Mary Philips (as Catherine's nurse best friend Fergie) are each perfect and wonderful.\r\n\r\nDefinitely make sure that it's the beautiful near pristine KINO release of this film that you watch, and not one of the degraded, too often butchered, public domain releases. On the KINO version (which is 89 minutes in length), the picture and sound is near perfect, and you'll readily be able to fully appreciate the visual glory of this film.\r\n\r\nThis is a movie that, despite my having the stated \"issues\" with it - and heretofore I failed to also mention its at times shameless ultra-melodrama (the letter-writing scene, or the final scene, anyone?) - I nonetheless always very much enjoy watching it, whenever I periodically do, and am always readily able to appreciate the things about it that are terrific. I consider this a very good film, and appreciate and enjoy it as such. I find myself feeling drawn to watch this again a time or two just about every year - and usually do.\r\n\r\nFYI: This review is also presented as a post on TMDb's **AFtA** message board, if wishing to comment/discuss.", "Frank Borzage presents us here with quite an effectively abridged version of the Hemmingway story of wartime romance. \"Frederic\" (Gary Cooper) is an American soldier who finds himself in hospital being cared for by nurse \"Catherine\" (the almost porcelain-like Helen Hayes). Their's is quickly a love story that has to compete with the atrocities of the Great War as he and she are both transferred and it becomes harder for them to communicate and be together. \"Frederic\" isn't helped by the well meaning interventions of his captain \"Rinaldi\" (Adolphe Menjou) who ensures that their written correspondence is unanswered - but when \"Frederic\" learns that a baby is due and that \"Catherine\" is now in Switzerland, he must rush to her side - even if that means desertion. To be honest the production isn't the best and the lighting could be doing with some extra wattage, but there is a genuine sense of chemistry between the couple and of frustration as their romance blossoms despite the prevailing difficulties. I reckon it's the best cinematic adaptation of this frequently quite torrid story, and well worth a gander,"], ["**When the house of peace was disturbed!**\r\n\r\nFrom the director Anne Fontaine. Like any of her works, this is another top class women oriented film. But it was partially based on the incredible true story. Partial means, no one knows what was the actual event. The director and her writers inspired by the diary the French doctor who worked for Red Cross in Poland at the end of the World War II, who wrote down her experience on it. So, with the small-small facts the story was built on for the film. Well done job by the cast and crew.\r\n\r\nWhenever you hear the word/abbreviation 'WWII', it always bound with nazi Germans. Since this tale takes place just after the war, when the Soviet took over the Poland from them, it is set to reveal one of the extremely hidden secrets. Just imagine how secret it is, like you have read many books and have seen many films regarding the WWII, but you have never heard about this, until now. It is a heart rending tale, but the thing is everything's about the aftermath, how they handled their state of condition.\r\n\r\nMathilde, the French doctor is fetched by a nun from the nearby convent is shocked when she reached there to see most of them are in the final stage of their pregnancy. They were sexually abused by the Soviet soldiers, but now she as to keep it quiet as requested by the mother superior. She's being an atheist and to whom she's treating, the believers, is exactly the opposite kind. But not just her, the nuns as well put aside their differences to overcome their situation.\r\n\r\n> \u275dFor us nuns, the end of the war does not mean the end of fear.\u275e\r\n\r\nIt's right on the coldest winter, does not tell about the original violence, but there's still a few incidents about the army atrocities, how they treated innocent nuns, even the Red Cross members. But remember nothing was the actual depiction. It would have been even better if it was a documentary film. Doing some research and telling us the tale, reading exactly as what was written in the diary. But the film was not bad, except the scene to scene, event to event it was very slow to move, except right on the point.\r\n\r\nThe story has a twist, but it was not like very powerful. It depends on how you would consider it. Because for me, I felt it was too cruel, hard to take on. The story about church people means, you would expect a gentle kind. Or even in such situation, as in this film, to react as much as possibly generously as what they're known for. But in the first place, it was no ones fault. They all fighting for the same reason, especially keeping the outside world in mind, each one reacted differently. So it is understandable, but not all the acts were respectable.\r\n\r\nAs the director said in her interview, this is a period film, but pretty much the same in the contemporary world where war is on. The violence against the innocent women. So it is a debatable topic. And if it was directed by some male filmmaker, he might have risked with the violences in the flashback scenes to bring more depth in the narration. The present film is kind of compromises on that, but still not easy to watch everything it shows. Particularly for the families. Great performances by all. One of the best films on this theme and of the year. The film is not to be ignored. Despite not about the war, but just like 'Under Sandet', about the following event.\r\n\r\n_8/10_"], ["Aleksandr Petrov's adaptation of this Ernest Hemingway story is quite exquisite to watch. An opening sequence that illustrates the beauty of the animal kingdom gives way to the old man and the boy looking out over the sea.

Next day, vows the old man, he just knows if he ventures far enough out to sea, he will catch something. A small fish takes his line, ideal bait for something bigger - and that bigger fish duly arrives for a battle royal. If you know the story, then you'll know what happens next and of the lessons the older man learns. It's a poignant story about endurance and pride, but also about knowing your own limitations and learning how to share and to rely on others. An hard series of lessons for a man set in his ways and determined to provide. The water-borne animation is a joy to watch, the detail contrasts beautifully with the grand scale of the location and the facial expressions are windswept and natural to watch. At times the whole thing looks like a succession of gorgeous paintings and really is a delight to watch."], ["**\"The Truman Show\"** dares to question the reality. It's original, complex, and philosophical. It manages to make you feel truly frustrated and **claustrophobic**. \r\n\r\nPerhaps many of us can relate to Truman as we live in a time of routines. We often live our lives without giving a second thought to the simplicity and meaninglessness of life itself. Our limited perspectives keep us from seeing. The lies we are told keep us from the truth. If we could push the boundaries of our reality, what are the odds that we'd face what Truman faced in the end?\r\n\r\nIt was a joy to watch **\"Jim Carrey\"** as **\"Truman\"**, it is yet another proof that Jim isn't just a comedian.", "Truman...One of my favourite films. It's just hilarious. The whole concept that this man thinks he is living in the real world.\r\n\r\nVery well done to the Director and Writers!", "On the surface, The Truman Show is about a man who has lived his life trapped inside of a bubble. He tries the entire movie to pop the bubble, and he eventually does.\r\n\r\nUnder that layer, though, is a complex theme. Does Truman really enjoy his cell? He seemed to for years. At the same time, he struggled with memories, but don't we all?\r\n\r\nAs the viewer, we're left to determine the morality of the happiness of millions versus the freedom of one. We're also left to consider whether Truman's cage was better than his freedom. A child born into a system that doesn't have a great track record or a life of relative safety with no knowledge of the cage.\r\n\r\nThe viewer also has to determine the sturdy nature of reality. What is reality besides our perception of it? What's real to Jim or to Bob? Are the things that are real to them real to me if I've never seen or heard about them?\r\n\r\nBeyond the philosophical questions the movie poses, the film itself is solid. Jim Carrey pulls off the part wonderfully. He's more than just a comedian, although he can bring the humor the instant the scene needs it. The supporting cast fell right in line.\r\n\r\nThe pacing may be a little slow early on for many viewers, but that is remedied once the action begins to pick up.\r\n\r\nIf you want something light and silly, go watch something else by Carrey.", "In a world experimenting with big brother reality shows and questioning what is real in a mtrix kind of way, The Truman Show is a splendid and well executed movie about a man owned by a corporation from birth, who lives on the set while not being aware of the fact that everything around him is fake.

So much fun to watch.\r\n\r\nJim Carrey, an actor I always enjoying watching, is terrific in the lead as Truman - he kills every moment, very much the perfect person to play this role.

I wanted to let it sit with me for a bit before watching it again and giving it a proper response.\r\n\r\nFilms like this, which are hyped to an unbelievable degree, end up sending an audience to end up watching it with elevated expectations, only to be ultimately disappointed afterwards. It\u2019s a fact that many films suffer considerably from this aspect of our cinephile culture, I\u2019ve experienced it with many films before.\r\n\r\n_Chungking Express_ has a reputation that I think may be beyond what it intended, with it being an Out-of-Print title at Criterion, the prices for the Blu-ray being obnoxiously high, and the constant barrage of exuberant reactions from many who\u2019ve seen the film. This kind of superficial intrigue alone can set me up with expectations that are likely to not be met. Every film that is being made does not intend to create this fa\u00e7ade of a reputation, it\u2019s just a film. Most creators are not there to make this kind of reaction happen out of their films, and yet, we somehow continue to do so\u2026\r\n\r\nI\u2019m rambling, aren\u2019t I? I think this is just my criticism with film culture regarding the hyping of certain films.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, somehow, despite my attempts to condense these (potential) hyperbolic reactions, _Chungking Express_ may have exceeded my expectations. Perhaps that makes me a hypocrite regarding this issue, but then again, if I enjoyed the film to the extent at which it met my expectations (or surpassed them in this case), am I to be negatively looked at for criticizing these actions, but essentially having them work on me specifically with _Chungking Express_? If so, then let it be I guess. Regardless, this film was one of the best experiences I have had in a while.\r\n\r\nIt is surprisingly easy for me to connect with this film and its characters. All of them have a certain struggle they must deal with, whether it\u2019d be relationship problems, not being able to move on, or even simply failing to accomplish a certain task. It\u2019s all relatively simple if I think about it, there isn\u2019t much in terms of characterization for many of the subjects in the film, and yet, I don\u2019t believe there needs to be that much. Simply leaving it the way it is works extremely well, and I\u2019m willing to believe that Wong Kar-Wai understood this.\r\n\r\nThere are statements that explain how Wong Kar-Wai essentially wrote scenarios for the film the morning of and shot the scenes later in the day. Easily, this could lead to a jumbled mess of separate ideas thrown together in the editing room at a feature length time. And yet, he stays consistent in the thematic ideas he proposes. Shot chronologically, the ideas set up through the first half of the film, have threads that continue onwards towards the second half.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite directors, Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, uses the elements of interconnectedness within his films. Regardless of how different the stories might be, there is something there that connects each story together. In _Chungking Express_, that idea is essentially brought out brazenly, to the extent at which it initially shocked me. That one moment at the half-way mark of the film, comes at you so fast, that afterwards you\u2019re left gasped for what the film turns into. It\u2019s a brazen switch of narrative, and yet, it\u2019s still leaves the film to be connected altogether.\r\n\r\nThe expectations for love are very much tricky in it of themselves, as is shown with each character that one sees in the film. It\u2019s not simple, it isn\u2019t black and white, but rather a spectrum that one must align itself with, and possibly adapt to if necessary. To deal with the aspects of love in a film can either be hokey and misguided, or it can be meticulous and interesting. _Chungking Express_ finds a middle ground between these two, not dealing too much towards the intellectual side of these issues, but not straying away too far towards the clich\u00e9d. Wong Kar-Wai doesn\u2019t treat these characters as caricatures. Sure, there are some humorous; sometimes childish, moments with Faye, but it doesn\u2019t take away from her character. As with every subject in the film, there is something to latch on to. All around the thematic ideas of love, or the lack thereof, worked together so well, that it leads to these characters feeling authentic. Not simply words on a script.\r\n\r\nI really don\u2019t know what else to say. I was awestruck the first time, and I feel even more so now. This is a film that really hit it home with me. More so than other films in the past.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll say this, by the end of the film, I had similar vibes to when I finished _Lost in Translation_ for the first time. Soon afterwards, that film was my favorite of all time for years.\r\n\r\nFilm culture is fascinating, it may lead to disappointing outcomes based on hyperbolic expectations, or it may lead to a film experience that you never thought were possible.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m beginning to lean towards the latter with _Chungking Express_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a difference a day made, what a difference a film makes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBut then again, it all comes down to personal preference, so for all I know you may hate this film. I don\u2019t know. You do you, and I\u2019ll do me. Got it?", "This is probably my favourite film from Kar-Wai Wong. It tells the stories of two Hong Kong Police officers. The former, the dashing Takeshi Kaneshiro, who is struggling to come to terms with his recently ended relationship of five years. By way of a means to closure, he purchases a tin of pineapple each day with the expiry date of May 1st (then he will be 25 years old). Either they will have reconciled by then, or he must look for a new love - and perhaps an enigmatic, somewhat shady, lady in a raincoat and wearing a blonde wig might offer a solution? The second features the slightly older regular with this director, Tony Leung, who has also split from his long-term partner only to find a new girl working at the stall he gets his meal from in the evening. She is equally enigmatic - and has a penchant for \"California Dreamin'\" played very loudly too. Both stories are throughly enjoyable to watch, the humour is plentiful and subtle - and we are never quite sure how anything is going to pan out, or even if the two stories are going to end up over-lapping - right until the end. The hand held photography helps the personalities develop well, offering us intimacy and also an opportunity to become more immersed in the two gently developing character studies that are imbued with the colours and culture of this bustling urban landscape.", "Filmed into the post production of two years of filming the Wuxia epic \"Ashes of Time\", with low resources, this movie is another example that we don't need millions of USD to make a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nWong Kar-Wai have a personal style of using melancholic characters distorted stories, using elaborate soundtracks in the background. This movie show two drama and crime stories about two lovesick policeman and their search over his relationship with a woman, always in a 0,01cm encounter of distance between them. \r\n\r\nThe first story stars Takeshi Kaneshiro as a cop obsessed by his breakup with a woman named May (replaced emotionally with letters and old pineapple cans), and his encounter with a mysterious drug smuggler. The second stars Tony Leung as a police officer roused from his gloom over the loss of his flight attendant girlfriend by the attentions of a quirky snack bar worker called Express - referred in the title (Faye Wong).\r\n\r\nBoth stories circles around Chungking Mansions, a 60's complex of buildings supposed to be residential, but that is made up of many independent low-budget hotels, shops and other services, filled with stores and stalls in the building cater to wholesalers shipping goods to Africa and South Asia, and amid the gigantic Central\u2013Mid-Levels escalator with a length of 800m and one of the two highlights locations of the movie.\r\n\r\nBoth sequences have a unique visual approach sometimes intimate, sometimes frenetic with a beautiful use of color among the chaos that reminds me of the works of the photographer Saul Leiter.\r\n\r\nOn the unique soundtrack using ocidental musics we have the use for the first story is Dennis Brown's \"Things in Life\" and \"Baroque\", composed by Michael Galasso, can be heard twice during the first part of the movie.\r\n\r\nOn the second \"California Dreamin'\" by The Mamas & the Papas plays in the key scenes in the second story, which also features Faye Wong's Cantonese cover version of \"Dreams\" by The Cranberries.\r\n\r\nIn the plans of making there was a third movie but since it was too long it was released as a separate movie, Fallen Angels in 1995.\r\n\r\nAnother must watch classic with a unique style that differentiates it from other Hong Kong productions - I gave it a 8,7 out of 10,0 / A rate.", "A total surprise, in the negative sense. The story was very random with little logic in it. Weird characters that also made little sense, and the conversations were poor and uninteresting. It was more like a Japanese anime story because of its randomness, but then not even interesting to watch.

I tried to finish it, but had to turn it off at 3/4 progress, for the sake of my mental health."], [], [], [], ["The 2009 remake does a better job at bringing its story to life, but 1975's <em>'Escape to Witch Mountain'</em> is still a good film.\r\n\r\nThe cast are all fine in their respective roles, even if none of them particularly standout. Eddie Albert (Jason), Kim Richards (Tia) and Ike Eisenmann (Tony) are satisfactory, as is Donald Pleasence as Deranian. With that said, I think Pleasence should've been the main villain here - there's really not much need for Ray Milland (Aristotle). Disney had a knack of doing that sorta thing in these early eras, having a bad guy and a bad guy's sidekick - most of the time, just one would suffice.\r\n\r\nThe pace of the film isn't perfect, but the premise itself is intriguing enough to keep it chugging along at a suitable rate. More action-packed events would've been greater, especially as the opening titles seem to suggest that that may be on the horizon.\r\n\r\nThat wasn't the case, yet I still had a decent time with this."], [], ["I KNOW I'm giving way too many stars for this, but I don't care; The Doors were one of my very first favourite groups. I fondly recall, when I was 11, and Elektra Records released 'The Doors' Greatest Hits', and the album-length version of 'Light My Fire' was played all the time on the radio, and I was mesmerized by the instrumental middle of the song, got the album from my parents for Christmas, and started a lifelong love affair with the band. Yes, Jim Morrison is highly overrated. Yes, the movie is an extremely self-indulgent mess and it can be quite incoherent and incohesive. But the Sixties, the L.A. rock scene back then, and especially Morrison's life, were just like that, so it is oh so fitting!\r\n\r\nI adore the fact that it was Oliver Stone's labour of love (one of thankfully many) and that the surviving members of the band basically had full input. I would take this and 'Talk Radio' (my personal favourite Stone's throw) over a hundred of Stone's politically over-the-top movies any day!\r\n\r\nWhen I was 17, I took my life savings and visited, on my own, nine European countries, including France and its capital, Paris. Did I go for the Eiffel Tower, wild romance on Richard Linklater-esque trains, or its outstanding magic and sidewalk cafes? No--train-wise I had to put up with a stupid labour strike, such that an overnight sleeper car from Berne, Switzerland to Paris had to be switched, in the middle of the night, FOUR times, just so they could prove a point. And it was just to see Morrison's grave. I met 20 fantastic people who had made the pilgrimage from all over the world, and it was my first time having red wine and smoking pot. The graffiti and the sculpture of him, in the Pere Lachaise cemetery, were fascinating, as was his life. Would I go through that again? Of course I would.\r\n\r\nIt's Val Kilmer's best work by a mile. The film just oozes charisma and breathes life--just as the band's work must have done back in the day. Worth a purchase and re-watches (I watch it each year on Jim's birthday and accidentally bought it twice), for any fan of 60's music or its culture. A bonafide classic when Stone was actually really something.", "A hypnotic film, but it emphasizes the negative side of Jim Morrison and is filled with fabrications.\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1991 and directed by Oliver Stone, \u201cThe Doors\u201d chronicles the Southern California band The Doors and their rise and fall between 1966-1971. The film focuses on charismatic singer Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer) who falls into alcoholism and drug-addiction. He flew to France in March, 1971, to join his girlfriend, Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan), and pursue a different career, but died the next summer due to his ongoing substance abuse. The other band members are played by Kyle MacLachlan (Ray Manzarek), Frank Whaley (Robby Krieger) and Kevin Dillon (John Densmore).\r\n\r\nI'm not old enough to remember The Doors. The first time I heard of them was when my older brother asked me if I knew of them. I busted out laughing saying, \"The Doors? Why don't they just call themselves The Window Sills.\" Yeah, I thought the name was pretty lame until I discovered Morrison's reasoning behind it:\r\n\r\nThere is what is known; And there is what is unknown; In between are the doors\r\n\r\nAnother thing that won my respect was their song that was used in the opening of \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d which is my all-time favorite film (the original version, not \"Redux\"). After that I bought their \"Best Of\" album and my impression was that their sound was horribly dated, even THEN. Over time, however, I've come to respect The Doors' music because it's so unique. They don't sound like anyone else. They have a weird, moody vibe, even their 'hits,\u2019 augmented by a strange carnival feel. Over top of it all is Morrison's commanding and haunting vox. I prefer their more artistic songs like \"Riders on the Storm\" and \"The End\" as opposed to their 'hits,' but who can deny the catchiness of \"Light My Fire\" or the goofy charm of \"People are Strange\"?\r\n\r\nThe film focuses on Jim Morrison and leaves the viewer with the impression that he was a miserable artistic-genius type who had no sense of moderation; he sought to escape his personal struggle through loose sex, substance misuse and rock 'n' roll. His excessive self-abuse eventually spilled over to those closest to him and ultimately landed him in a premature grave. His body lies in Paris, a mecca to his fans who have spray-painted the surrounding monuments with gaudy graffiti, some of it profane. The image this leaves you with is that Jim Morrison is no fun to be around, even in death.\r\n\r\nSo \u201cThe Doors\u201d is pretty much the ultimate story of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Stone said he based his view of Morrison, as depicted in the film, on 160 transcripts of people that actually knew him or were around him and the band. From these documents emerged a central truth about Morrison's final years, an image of wild excess. Because of this, I was left with a bad impression of the man. I felt Morrison was a spaced-out, immature jerk, abusive to both himself and others, foolishly sacrificing his life and talents on the altar of alcohol & drug idolatry.\r\n\r\nYet this was only part of the truth. Thankfully the 37-minute documentary on the 'extras' disc, \"The Road to Excess\" (1997), balances things out. One of Morrison's sweethearts, wiccan Patricia Kennealy (played by Kathleen Quinlan in the movie), the guitarist and another guy offer the other side of the story. They properly point out that Stone's film only shows Jim's 'wild & crazy' side, emphasizing that the events depicted in the picture, while sometimes true, aren't \"all that happened.\" They unanimously describe Morrison as genuine, innocent, shy, loving and gallant, an amazing person who made those around him feel important, as if he was their best friend. Robby even states that Jim was \"the most influential person I've ever met.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition, the documentary features numerous clips of Morrison himself, clearly showing him to be a fun-loving, nice and sane person rather than the spaced-out, abuse-driven dude shown in the film. Needless to say, the documentary helps round-out one's image of the man.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: Val Kilmer doesn't just play Jim Morrison, he IS Jim Morrison. This is no small feat and vital to the film in light of the fact that he appears in practically every frame. He should have won an award. In any case, if you're in the mood for something that captures that late-60s counter-culture vibe \u201cThe Doors\u201d is worth checking out, but it tends to exaggerate things in the name of mythmaking, which is usually the case with movies. For instance, Jim never lit up a closet door with Pamela locked inside (rolling my eyes), the idiotic Thanksgiving dinner sequence never happened and the naked revelries at concerts (and the bonfire) are overblown fabrications.  Still, the movie\u2019s mesmerizing in a spaced-out way and highlighted by The Doors' music throughout. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the first half is superior to the second half, which becomes too unpleasant, offering a very limited and unflattering impression of Morrison. That's why it's essential to also watch \"The Road to Excess\" on the bonus disc or, better yet, the excellent 2009 documentary \u201cThe Doors: When You\u2019re a Stranger,\u201d which exclusively uses footage and photos from 1966-1971. Another problem with Stone\u2019s movie is that it loses its dramatic pull in the second half in preference for hypnotic yet chaotic visual mayhem, not to mention outright lies.    \r\n\r\nLastly, in \u201cThe Road to Excess\u201d Oliver Stone makes a couple of really asinine statements. Commenting on Morrison, he states: \"To live life intensely and well and die young and achieve everlasting fame & glory is the greatest. It's Achilles, it's Alexander, it's... Jim Morrison.\" Huh? Another dubious line is: \"The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom.\" Is he on drugs? Jim's road of excess led straight to an early grave, not enlightenment.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nGRADE: C (but the \"The Road to Excess\" documentary gets an A-/B+)", "Not enough credit is actually given to this great piece of filmmaking. \r\nOliver Stone at his finest, some acting performances of the highest degree.

I am not against their existence, there is room for them and cinema is a legitimate form for the expression and defense of political, social or moral agendas, theories and ideas. It's simply not a type of cinema that I really like to consume, not least because it's a niche cinema, that is, that tends to please those who already defend those ideas, in addition to trying to convince us to accept them. This film does precisely that with homosexuality. There are more and more films that talk about the subject, some do it with skill and even a healthy neutrality, which leaves us room to think and doesn't try to teach us the opinions we should have. \u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d, \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d or even \u201cMilk\u201d are good films about the theme and about people who defended well the sacred right of homosexuals (and of any citizen) to live their sex life without being the target of recriminations, as long as obey the laws like all citizens. This movie is not that good.\r\n\r\nThe script focuses on two young people from troubled families in the suburbs of London: after refusing to go home, where he suffers aggression, Steven is welcomed by Jamie's mother. The closeness between the two teenagers eventually leads them to become sexually involved, leading to major complications as their relationship becomes increasingly obvious to everyone who lives there. That is, the film is like so many others, except that it is about homosexuals who live in a kind of urban Babylon where crime, alcohol, drugs, sex and the end of moral values grow more easily than weeds. Supposedly, their relationship is the purest and most innocent thing that is born there... or that's what the film tries to convince us. I wouldn't have so many problems with the moral degradation of that social environment if the story was good, but it's not: it's too sugary, melodramatic, it's full of clich\u00e9s, and it's approached in a dogmatic way, always around prejudice and shame in being homosexual. The film does not deviate from this tone and, using cheap sentimentality, wants to force us to think in a certain way.\r\n\r\nGlenn Berry and Scot Neal are two actors I didn't know, and whose careers didn't take off. I don't know where they are today, but I can say that, from what I've seen, they don't seem to be working as actors anymore and haven't achieved any success. Perhaps this is due to the absolute lack of charisma that both suffer from, and that did not help them to sustain their role in this film. Linda Henry is much more effective and competent, even if she cannot save the film. On a technical level, and being an independent film with a limited budget, we can't fault it. The film does a good job with what it has. There just isn't anything that is really notable, or outstanding.", "\"Jamie\" (Glen Berry) lives with his single-parent mum \"Sandra\" (Linda Henry) on a London housing estate. He's a slight lad who is prone to bullying at school which leads him to skive off now and again to go home and watch musicals on the telly. Next door is his schoolmate \"Ste\" (Scott Neal) who has a pretty torrid time of his own with a father and brother who thinking nothing of knocking him about. The lads start to bond and are soon firm friends whose relationship could be starting to burgeon into something more... This film has a distinct charm about it. Sure, maybe it's a wee bit stereotypical at times, but there are strong efforts from Neal, Berry, especially Henry and from Ben Daniels as her love interest \"Tony\" - who appears to be little better than a dope smoking idler initially, but who is actually rather more than that. It addresses issues of brutality, parenthood and pride - but somehow you just know that there is going to be light at the end of the tunnel and by choosing this ostensibly hostile location for the setting, that light becomes all the more potent as our story develops. It's clearly been done on a budget, the production is a bit on the basic side - but this is a story about character - the strengths and depth of it - and it moves along well and quite powerfully for an engaging ninety minutes."], [], ["God, this movie is bad.

It was also a cultural and political happening.\r\n\r\nInto the capital of Kinshasa flew planeloads of performers for an \u201cAfrican Woodstock,\u201d TV crews, Howard Cosell at the head of an international contingent of sports journalists, celebrity fight groupies like Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, and of course the two principals: Ali, then still controversial because of his decision to be a conscientious objector, and Foreman, now huggable and lovable in TV commercials but then seen as fearsome and forbidding.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm young, I'm handsome, I'm fast, I'm strong, and I can't be beat,\u201d Ali told the press. They didn't believe him. Foreman had destroyed George Frazier, who had defeated Ali. Foreman was younger, bigger and stronger, with a punch so powerful, Mailer recalled, \u201cthat after he was finished with a heavy punching bag, it had a depression pounded into it.\u201d Ali was 33 and thought to be over the hill. The odds were 7-1 against him.\r\n\r\nThe Zaire that they arrived in was a country much in need of foreign currency and image refurbishment. Under the leadership of Mobutu Sese Seko (\u201cthe archetype of a closet sadist,\u201d said Mailer), the former Belgian Congo had became a paranoid police state; the new stadium built to showcase the fight was rumored to hold 1,000 political prisoners in cells in its catacombs.\r\n\r\nDon King, then at the dawn of his career as a fight promoter, had sold Mobutu on the fight and raised $5 million for each fighter. The \u201cAfrican Woodstock,\u201d featuring such stars as B.B. King, James Brown and Miriam Makeba, was supposed to pay for part of that. For Ali, the fight in Africa was payback time for the hammering he'd taken in the American press for his refusal to fight in Vietnam. For Foreman, it was more complicated. So great was the pro-Ali frenzy, Foreman observed, that when he got off the plane the crowds were surprised to find that he was also a black man. \u201cWhy do they hate me so much?\u201d he wondered.\r\n\r\nLeon Gast's \u201cWhen We Were Kings,\u201d which just received an Oscar nomination, is like a time capsule; the original footage has waited all these years to be assembled into a film because of legal and financial difficulties. It is a new documentary of a past event, recapturing the electricity generated by Muhammad Ali in his prime. Spike Lee, who with Mailer and Plimpton provides modern commentary on the 1974 footage, says young people today do not know how famous and important Ali was. He is right. \u201cWhen I fly on an airplane,\u201d Ali once told me, \u201cI look out of the window and I think, I am the only person that *everyone* down there knows about.\u201d It is not bragging if you are only telling the truth.\r\n\r\nThe original film apparently started as a concert documentary. Then the fight was delayed because of a cut to Foreman's eye. The concert went ahead as scheduled, and then the fighters, their entourages and the press settled down to wait for the main event. No one really thought Ali had a chance--perhaps not even Ali, who seems reflective and withdrawn in a few private moments, although in public he predicted victory.\r\n\r\nHow could he have a chance, really? Hadn't he lost his prime years as a fighter after he refused to fight in Vietnam? (\u201cI ain't got no quarrel with the Viet Cong,\u201d he explained.) Wasn't Foreman bigger, faster, stronger, younger? History records Ali's famous strategy, the \u201cRope-a-Dope\u201d defense, in which he simply outwaited Foreman, absorbing incalculable punishment until, in the eighth round, Foreman was exhausted and Ali exploded with a series of rights to the head, finishing him.\r\n\r\nWas this, however, really a strategy at all? \u201cWhen We Were Kings\u201d gives the impression that Ali got nowhere in the first round and adopted the Rope-a-Dope almost by default. Perhaps he knew, or hoped, that he was in better condition than Foreman, and could outlast him if he simply stayed on his feet. It is certain that hardly anyone in Zaire that night, not even his steadfast supporter Cosell, thought that Ali could win; the upset became an enduring part of his myth.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen We Were Kings\u201d captures Ali's public persona and private resolve. As heavyweight champion during the Vietnam War, he could easily have arrived at an accommodation with the military, touring bases in lieu of combat duty.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was called a coward and a draft dodger, surely it took more courage to follow the path he chose. And yet it is remarkable how ebullient, how joyful, he remained even after the price he paid; how he is willing to be a clown and a poet as well as a fighter and an activist.\r\n\r\nSeeing the film today inspires poignant feelings; we contrast younger Ali with the ailing and aging legend, and reflect that this fight must have contributed to the damage that slowed him down. It is also fascinating to contrast the young Foreman with today's much-loved figure; he, too, has grown and mellowed. When the movie was made all of those developments were still ahead; there is a palpable tension, as the two men step into the ring, that is not lessened because we know the outcome."], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["_**Arty flick about survival in the Outback and coming-of-age**_\r\n\r\nA teenage girl (Jenny Agutter) and her little brother get stuck in the Outback, but receive assistance by an aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil) on a \u2018walkabout,\u2019 a rite of passage into manhood.\r\n\r\nDirected by Nicolas Roeg, \u201cWalkabout\u201d (1971) is an arty cult flick that plays like a Terrence Malick film and no doubt influenced his style (since it came out two years before Malick\u2019s feature film debut with \u201cBadlands\u201d).

Godard borrows the character of Lemmy Caution, a tough FBI agent/secret agent played by Eddie Constantine that had appeared in a number of French B movies, and then Godard drops Caution into a science-fiction film. And yet, this film taking place in a different galaxy far, far away doesn't use any specially created sets or fancy ray guns. Instead, Godard simply shot the film at examples of modernist architecture in Paris, in industrial buildings, and among the room-sized IBM mainframe computers of his time.\r\n\r\nIn the dystopian city of Alphaville, all decisions are made by the gigantic Alpha 60 computer that pursues logic at all cost, banning human emotions and leaving the inhabitants zombified. Caution is sent from outside with the task of retrieving Alpha 60's creator, the rogue scientist Von Braun (Howard Vernon). Caution's femme fatale is Natasha Von Braun (Anna Karina), daughter of the scientist, whom she has never met. Though just as zombified as the other inhabitants of Alphaville, Natasha shows a budding individuality. Caution is baffled by the inexplicable behavior shown by the inhabitants of this city, but he remains focused on his goal of extracting Von Braun, no matter how many obstacles are thrown in his way.\r\n\r\nALPHAVILLE is often categorized as a science-fiction film, but it's soon obvious that Godard was interested more in the changing world around him in the 1960s. He worried that the technocratic society, the desire to use technology to solve all manner of problems from food distribution to architecture, would rob the human race of a certain flexibility, of a certain liberty, and of a certain poetry. (It's interesting that Godard anticipated so much of the Sixties counterculture that would preoccupy the youth, though he was already well into his thirties, and themes that would later be explored by thinkers like Theodore Roszak.) Alpha 60 is less a vision of the far future, something from a time of intergalactic space travel, than a rising trend of the mid 20th-century.\r\n\r\nI had heard of the premise and much of the details before and I thought the film would be lame, but I absolutely loved it. I came to ALPHAVILLE after watching Godard's work to date, which features some remarkable imagery and avant-garde techniques, but is rarely very comedic. I had no idea that ALPHAVILLE would be so hilarious. As the film opens, we see Godard playing with the trope of the hardboiled detective or spy overcoming assassins sent to kill him, and this is exaggerated to the point it becomes slapstick. There are a lot of absurdist touches here (see the mass execution scene, where clearly any attempt at realism has been avoided).\r\n\r\nThe performances here are great, too. In spite of the unusual script, which might have had some actors blowing off the director's concerns, Eddie Constantine unflappably maintains his noir style here. Akim Tamiroff turns in a great supporting role as Caution's fellow agent Dickson, and this already elderly actor brings in a lifetime of experience in comedic roles. Karina continues to show that, while Godard was originally interested in her merely as a pretty face, she had enormous talent. Some of the long shots are cleverly done, and the film includes an exciting car chase.", "Ivan Caution explores the dystopian Alphaville where the only truth is logic, anything else is punishable by death. Everybody is popping pills, womenn are classes by their seductive level and the men are merely puppets to the computer Alpha 60.\r\n\r\nThe plot is strangely reminiscent of today, almost in a predictive fashion. It seems to be influenced by 1984 but it doesn\u2019t do so in a repetitive or tiring manner. Moreover the film is really refreshing. Shots that simply don\u2019t happen anymore. The story although basically similar to many movies, doesn\u2019t seem that predicable and I wasn\u2019t dreading the end. The love story is also not just thrown in there, but actually helps understand what kind of place Alphaville really is.\r\n\r\nEffects that could be done at home with ease, but yet work so well. For example, at one point a character interacts with a hanging bulb, which then goes on to swing and show us all the angles of light that could arise. Another example is a straight on shot of a mans blood stained shirt after he gets shot.\r\n\r\nThroughout the movie there are flashes of different things:lights, fans, and neon displays.

Roxanne is the dolphin being studied by Mary Beth (Kathleen Quinlan), when she isn't busy running after her bratty daughters Judith (Majandra Delfino) and Nora (Jessica Howell). Dog and dolphin meet in the opening scene of the film and the two seem to share a special bond that is never fully explored by the screenwriter.  Terry and Mary Beth happen to live across the street from each other, and Zeus follows Mary Beth to work to see Roxanne. We also meet our villain, Dr. Carver (Arnold Vosloo), who pens his dolphins to study them instead of letting them frolic in the open sea like Roxanne does. Mary Beth decides to apply for a grant to study inter-species communication after seeing Zeus and Roxanne's interaction.  Judith, Nora, and Jordan set Terry and Mary Beth up on a date that goes so well the kids decide shacking up would be the next logical step in the relationship. Terry has second thoughts (making one wonder where his first thoughts are since both adults are shamelessly manipulated by their offspring), and bolts with boy and dog, while Roxanne acts out in her own way. We can't have a story without some conflict, so Carver steals Mary Beth's idea and tries interspecies with his own dolphins and animals in the film's only funny scene. Zeus escapes Terry and Jordan and heads back to Roxanne, while the dolphin is rumored dead and Mary Beth goes looking for her.\r\n\r\nIf I needed to describe \"Zeus and Roxanne\" with one word, that word would be \"mild.\" The film makers saw their target audience, the family, and dumbed down every aspect of the production. What is produced is a bland saltine of a movie more at home on a basic cable family channel, sandwiched in between reruns of drab thirty-year old sitcoms.  Terry and Jordan, two of the film's lead characters, really don't have to be here at all. Zeus could have been a stray dog discovered by Mary Beth, and the main plot of the film (dog and dolphin) could have remained intact. Instead, Terry is an immature musician cared for by Jordan, whose photographs of Zeus reminded me of early Robert Mapplethorpe. So we must suffer through the pulp romance mechanics of Mary Beth and Terry's courtship, while dog and dolphin take a back seat to the humans.\r\n\r\nKathleen Quinlan is actually quite good here.

It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christian Slater, William Petersen, Alan Ruck, Vigo Mortensen and Balthazar Getty. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri, with contributions from Jon Bon Jovi, and cinematography is by Dean Semler.\r\n\r\nBrushy Bill Roberts, old and crusty, claims to be Billy The Kid. Which is quite a claim considering the Kid was long thought to have been killed by Patrick Floyd Garrett in 1881. Roberts tells a listening historian that after the break up of the Tunstall Regulators, the remaining members hooked up with Garrett and Arkansas Dave Rudabaugh and still lived the outlaw life...\r\n\r\nYoung Guns was released in 1988 and became a big enough hit to warrant this sequel two years later. Reuniting gunslingers Billy the Kid (Estevez), Doc Scurlock (Sutherland) and Chavez (Phillips) from the first film, Young Guns II follows the same formula that worked so well two years previously. Billy is still a borderline nut case and his gang, for better or worse, follow him into a number of escapades. This time around, though, we have some added interest in the form of Christian Slater's cocky Rudabaugh, who, as an egotist, wants to run the gang himself. Things are further given a lift when Garrett (a darn fine William Petersen resplendent with major face fuzz) leaves the gang and is persuaded to become a law man. His first job being of course to catch Billy!\r\n\r\nBoth Young Guns movies are frowned upon by many old school Western purists, which to a degree I understand. They lack any sort of psychological aspects outside of a brat packer like cast shooting and quipping with care free abandon. Character depth is lacking so there is nothing on which to hang your hat on. Here, much like the first film, creative license is used with historical facts but the core basis of story is solid, with many of the events leading up to the documented death of Billy the Kid holding true. Major problem here, though, is that the makers are spinning off from the iffy claim of Brushy Bill Roberts that he was Billy the Kid and did not die at the hands of Pat Garrett. Knowing Billy survives the pursuit and show-down with Garrett at the start of the film kind of dilutes the wonder and impending drama! Film also at times feels like a composite of Little Big Man, Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid and of course Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid.\r\n\r\nHowever, both films, and more so with this sequel, have such a sense of fun like homage to them it's not hard to forgive the obvious flaws. Action is plentiful, with much blood shed during the course of the story, while the story always remains intriguing by way of the character dynamics. Semler's photography is more in tune with the Wild West this time around, as is Silvestri's score, the latter of which lifts parts of his \"Predator\" arrangement to blend with more traditional cowboy harmonies. Great song from Bon Jovi to close the film down as well. \r\n\r\nThere's a nice link to Peckinpah's movie with an important cameo for James Coburn as John Chisum (Coburn played Pat Garrett in Peckinpah's pic). But most of all it's just great fun to be in the company of Estevez's Billy, it's true enough to say it comes at the expense of the other characters around him, for it's a film owning show, which also dubiously swerves us into cheering for the baby faced \"outlaw hero\". Yet it plays out as a rollicking good ride in spite of some grey area thematics and a roll call of clich\u00e9s. And boys, oh boys, Jenny Wright pops in to raise the temperatures considerably with a Lady Godiva moment. If for nothing else, the Young Guns movies got people talking about the Western genre in the MTV age, so that has to be a bonus to the discerning Western fan. \r\n\r\nAcknowledge the faults by all means, but viewing them as gun slinging fun wrapped around real Western folklore might just help you enjoy the experience a touch more. 7/10"], [], [], [], [], [], ["**The power and importance of cultural roots.**\r\n\r\nThis was the first New Zealand film I saw, at least as far as I remember and am aware of that. It's a violent film, with a raw brutality that shocks us by how authentic it sounds. Domestic violence? Child rape? It's not something you only see in the movies. It's something you see in a newspaper. That's what shocks us the most: knowing it's something real. And I warn you now: there are violent films, but this one is really intense and shocking... a lot.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place in Auckland, in a poor suburb built by the State for people with very low incomes. There lives an overwhelmingly Maori population, apparently on the margins of Anglo-Saxon, white and elegant society. This country ceased to be a colony a long time ago but, as happens in many places in the world, the dominant ethnic group is still that of European descendants and there is a certain dominant racism. In the midst of this, this Maori population seems lost, aimless in the midst of vices and crime. Will that be reality? I don't know, but a quick search of some New Zealand newspapers indicates that the problem is real.\r\n\r\nLee Tamahori did a good job of preventing this film from becoming something it shouldn't be, that is, a tearful drama or an anti-racist manifesto that is no longer given the attention it deserves. Instead, the director starts from this base and makes a blunt and sincere affirmation of the importance of searching for cultural roots and the way in which this changes our way of being and our attitude in life. Why does Jake Heke do what he does? Because he cut all ties with his culture and roots after he ran away with his wife in order to get married. In doing so, he took refuge in violence. The children would also suffer from this, and only a reencounter with their roots can give them the guidance in life that they so badly need, and that they instinctively seek.\r\n\r\nThe film has excellent cinematography and visuals. Personally, I don't really like the graphics that were used for the opening and ending credits, I think they are out of character for the movie, but that's just my opinion. Discreet in the effects, soundtrack and sounds, it is a film that seeks to be effective but discreet, in order to give the story and the actors all the space to have our full attention. Even so, the settings are worth seeing, particularly the Heke house and the wrecked car where Toot, a homeless young man, lives.\r\n\r\nThe film has an excellent direction, screenplay and sets, but none of it would work well without competent actors. Rena Owen largely fulfills this requirement with a work worthy of being studied by aspiring actors. The actress is extraordinary, she does such a good job that it's hard to understand why the film wasn't considered, at least, for the Oscar for Best Actress (is it because she didn't have that week in Los Angeles that the Academy demands?) .

With no intention of soft soaping the story, the makers cunningly lure us viewers onto the seamy New York streets.

Some may be put off by the scenes of pubic hair, semen, and lewd displays of genitalia, male and female. However, it is questionable to dismiss the film's unusual artistry on that basis alone. No one can fail to notice that the sex scenes depicted in \"Ai no Corrida\" are ten thousand times better than those in the erotic \"Species\".

By this mid-point, one has had enough of Banderas, who comes off more like a deranged excitable kid than someone to be feared. Donner really falters there, but conversely he gets an interestingly engaging tune out of Stallone.

It's hard to believe that a pirate action film such as this would not be better appreciated had it been released in the following decade, and I say that not just because of the success of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, but more so that the blunderbuss popcorn movie has had greater support these days. There's a good portion of the movie loving faithful who just want to be entertained, where rapid thrills are a requisite, not well drawn characterisations and thespian class. Judged on those terms then Cutthroat Island is a winner for sure.\r\n\r\nMain problems are the clunky script and the three pronged miscast errors in the lead roles. Davis (erm, wife of Harlin) is full of guts, really attacking the material with gusto, but she never convinces, it always feels like a caricature and she's uncomfortable delivering key lines. She would prove herself a fine action actress a year later with The Long Kiss Goodnight (also with Harlin directing), but she's woefully out of place here. With Davis demanding more and more screen time for her character, the role of Shaw began to thin out, which was too much to bear for Michael Douglas who bowed out late in the day. In came Matthew Modine, zero chemistry with Davis, a bland acting style and as far removed from the period setting as you could get. Langella just isn't menacing as the main villain of the piece, a very good actor in the right role, but not here and some of his attempts at nastiness feel like panto season has started early.\r\n\r\nSo problems for sure, but wade through some of the misconceptions and poisonous press and you will find a film desperately aiming to please you, and with that there is much on offer for the pirate movie fan to savour. 7/10", "OK, so there's precious little original here but I still quite enjoyed Geena Davis doing her best Maureen O'Hara impression as the buccaneer \"Adams\". She sort of accedes to the ship's captaincy after the death of her father, but her crew are less than convinced. She's going to have to prove her worth. So, now pursued by the arch-baddie \"Dawg\" (Frank Langella), she and her hapless but handsome slave \"Shaw\" (Matthew Modine) must get hold of the three pieces of a rather unique map and find the treasure. What now ensues pitches loads of piratical duplicity against some colonial interference from the British Governor \"Ainslee\" (Patrick Malahide) and a scheming of a dastardly baddie - and all accompanied by plenty of quickly paced swash, buckle and musketry. It's a bit long, the story seems to take forever to get past the who's who stage, but once we are at sea then the film becomes a jolly and lively maritime caper. I could have been doing with a little more from Langella, and much less of the romanic interludes that increasingly clutter up the thing, but all in all, it's still quite a fun romp."], ["In the 1990s, Ray Kurzweil wrote about his \"Singularity\" theory - the future when man and computer are wholly merged. His predictions of AI are perhaps only now coming to fruit. This 1995 movie is the original Ghost In The Shell, which I finally watched. Mamoru Oshii's masterpiece, based on a manga by Shirow Masamune, is not only consistent with Singularity theory, but also remarkably prescient. This is the first film to broach the tough question of \"what does it mean to be conscious?\" in the context of AI (Artificial Intelligence).", "It's a society where humanity has been largely subsumed into a digital world; where cyborgs are a norm and where people are now, essentially, dependant on their own technology for just about all aspects of their survival.

It knows that by accessing the minds of those connected to the internet, it can obtain lots of juicy information to facilitate a spree of lucrative and threatening crime.

Their job is to reverse-engineer some of these hacks and to try and trace the mastermind before it becomes unstoppable. What now ensues is not the finest example of animation you will ever see - indeed some of the artistry is disappointingly basic and linear. What makes this work is a sold story that questions the very soul of what it is to be an human being. It probes what makes us, well, us... Our identity, our personality - all are vulnerable to manipulation here by something adept at capitalising on the flaws and failings of each of us. Once these flood gates are open, is it even possible to arrest it as global interconnectivity makes control nigh on impossible. There are emerging elements of apocalypse to the plot - but they serve to illustrate the dangers of walking into convenience eyes open, but not looking - and there's some potent dialogue here about our complicity in our what could potentially be our own downfall.

It stars Madeleine Stowe, Mary Stuart Masterson, Andie MacDowell and Drew Barrymore. The plot sees the four girl actors playing prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and a hanging escape. Suffice to say that they get into scrapes & double crosses whilst being pursued by the Pinkertons.\r\n\r\nBeing asked to suspend disbelief is one thing, being force fed drivel masquerading as pro-feminism is entirely another. Bad Girls is a mess of a movie, an insult to the Western genre, to the fans of the lady actors, to the lady actors themselves, who simply deserve much much better and arguably worst of all - to women in general. The script is laughable, serving only as an excuse for the gals to sling those guns and hips when possible, whilst being abused and saved by \"men\", while the plotting is by the numbers as everything falls into place readily. There's even slow-mo shots where they serve no purpose of enhancement. Throw into the mix that three of the ladies look nothing like on the run outlaws, all shine and span and make up with nice hair (Masterson the exception as she has a modicum of believability about her), well it's rather a depressing experience all told. Sure, as a red blooded guy I'm not going to be turned off by Barrymore's shapely thighs adorned in white stockings, or Stowe's truly gorgeous face, but when the highlights of a \"girl\" Western is something that's only aesthetically sexy for men, then they clearly have got it wrong.\r\n\r\nSo what's the justification for it being so bad? Well the back story offers up the answer. Film was meant to be directed by a woman, Tamra Davis (erm-Billy Madison & Crossroads), but she was jettisoned a couple of weeks into production. The plan with Davis at the helm was for it to be a Western told from a female point of view. However, Kaplan (The Accused/Unlawful Entry) was brought in quickly and the screenplay rewritten in a hurry. And boy does it show. Technically it's a duffer too, Jerry Goldsmith's score is cheap in texture and Jane Kurson's editing is choppy to say the least. There's no eye catching cinematography (Ralf D. Bode), while the acting away from the script hindered girls (ie: the men), is either a waste of time them being in it (Nick Chinlund) or badly directed (James Russo). While Dermot Mulroney seems only to exist as being a link to Young Guns - the \"boy\" version that this is clearly trying to ride the coat tails in on. If you want a good Western about the girls fighting the good fight then seek out George Marshall's 1957 film The Guns Of Fort Petticoat. It's a fun movie that at least has believable women fighting back under duress. Bad Girls, tho, is just bad in every department. 2/10", "_**Not so bad cowgirls**_\r\n\r\nIn 1891, four prostitutes in Echo City, Colorado (Madeleine Stowe, Andie MacDowell, Mary Stuart Masterson and Drew Barrymore), flee the law with Pinkertons hot on their trail. Eventually they have to tangle with a band of Hispanic outlaws to retrieve some money.\r\n\r\n\"Bad Girls\" (1994) is a Western with cowgirls as the protagonists rather than cowboys. It combines the tone of \"Silverado\" (1985) and the later \u201cThe Mask of Zorro\u201d (1998) so anyone who likes those flicks will probably like this one even if it\u2019s arguably the least of \u2019em.\r\n\r\nThe Western staples are checked with a saloon brouhaha, a lynch mob, a posse, Pinkerton detectives, a swimmin' hole scene, steam locomotives, a handsome hero (Dermot Mulroney), magnificent Western vistas, a bank robbery, a mirthful Latino bandit (James Russo) and the four heroes grimly walking side-by-side to the showdown. Yet there are a few original elements as well if you look closely.\r\n\r\nWhile all four of the stars are beautiful in their unique way, young Drew stands out and is just stunning. Speaking of the females, occupations & freedom were limited to women in the Old West, and the movie effectively drives this home. \r\n\r\nPeople usually cite the available professions as marriage, school-marming, prostitution and old biddy-hood. But what about clerking of one manner or another? What about entertainment, like at local saloons, traveling troupes and Old West Shows? What about writing, like Harriet Beecher Stowe? What about ranch-owning? In other words, there were more options, but women had to use their imagination and take a bold step. The four heroines in \u201cBad Girls\u201d are up to the task.\r\n\r\nLike the two Westerns noted above, this one takes the larger-than-life, mythmaking approach rather than shoot for anything very believable. If you can roll with that, it fills the bill, just not as well as \u201cThe Mask of Zorro\u201d or \u201cAmerican Outlaws\u201d (2001).\r\n\r\nThe opening act wrongly paints the Christians marching in Echo City as enemies when, in real life, they would be the very people trying to help the protagonists out of the miserable bondage of prostitution, which all four wanted free from in the first place. While I understand people\u2019s issues with life-stifling legalists, depicting the trampling of the Bible is gross ignorance. \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot at Alamo Village, Brackettville, Texas , and nearby Del Rio, as well as Red Hills Ranch, Sonora, California, and nearby Sierra Railroad, Jamestown.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+"], [], [], [], [], ["Jack Palance is ideally cast here as the Hollywood producer (\"Prokosch\") who has commissioned the legendary director Fritz Lang to breathe a last breath of life into the once thriving peplum genre with an adaptation of Homer's \"Odyssey\". He sees the rushes, and aside from a little nymph swimming in the nude, is unimpressed. Solution? Draft in accomplished playwright turned screenwriter \"Paul\" (Michel Piccoli) to liven things up. $10k is his fee and that will be enough to complete the renovations on the flat he shares with wife \"Camille\" (Brigitte Bardot). Thing is, though, as he starts to become more engaged with the film, his previously loving marriage starts to hit the skids. \"Camille\" is now distinctly off with him and even flirting with their new boss. Things all come to an head when they travel to Capri for the filming before a Parisian tragedy strikes. Now this is, indeed, a beautiful film to look at. The frequently naked Bardot, the glorious scenery and quite an interesting look behind the scenes at the now collapsed CineCitt\u00e0 studios that well illustrated the former greatness of this industry as effectively as the Coliseum does for the now faded greatness of Rome. The story - well that's quite another matter. I found it to be contrived and bitty. Their arguments come from nowhere and make little sense. Like petulant teenage spats. Perhaps \"Paul\" is playing a game to leverage his wife for a greater payment? Perhaps he just doesn't understand what makes her tick? She certainly appears to have little idea what makes him, and I found there to be very little on screen chemistry between them - even when the scenes were a bit more intimate. What's also a bit unhelpful is the Georges Delerue score. It's lovely and rich, of course, but Godard turns it on and off like a tap. It's like a musical interlude between the increasingly frustrating scenes that repeats the refrains then stops for the dialogue. Almost like an orchestrated jingle! Fritz Lang steals his scenes - basically because he comes across easily as the most natural of these characters, and Palance is - as usual - as wooden as a plank.

With Angelina Jolie, Hedy Burress, Jenny Lewis, Jenny Shimizu, and Sarah Rosenberg as its stars, the movie is heavily female driven. Set in the 1990s in Portland, Oregon and centers on a teenage girl named Maddy Wirtz (Burress) as she recalls her senior year. She then meets a mysterious girl (Jolie) and upon learning of the sexual abuse that Violet (Rosenberg) and Rita put up with (Lewis) from Mr. Buttinger (John Diehl), she along with the other girls decide to rise up and take revenge on him.\r\n\r\n  Maddy then learns that the girl's name is Legs and then informs her that their is an abandoned house up the river where she can stay. Then while at school she and the other girls learn that they've been reported for assaulting a teacher. Suspended from school and unable to get her art portfolio Maddy and the girls retreat to the abandoned house. Legs then insists they break into the school and retrieve the portfolio. At first their plan goes smoothly until Goldie (Shimizu) finds a rather unflattering photo of herself, she pulls to the side to smoke a joint but ends up setting off the school's sprinkler system.\r\n\r\n  The girls then frantically try to escape the school and evade the police and fireman. They are successful and get back to the house, Legs then decides to commemorate the night by giving herself a tattoo. She then proceeds to brand the others as they sip wine and smoke. The next day Maddy's boyfriend Ethan (Peter Facinelli) is surprised to find that she has assaulted a teacher and gotten a tattoo. The girls then read a letter from another student who reveals she was pursued by Buttinger as well. Later that night the girls are dancing, but their fun is interrupted by the local jocks. Furious that the girls accused and assaulted Mr. Buttinger because he is their coach they threaten the girls. Only for Maddy to tell them to get lost, while Rita flirts with one of the jocks.\r\n\r\n  The gang then starts roaming the streets at night, from a skatepark, to sharing a drink to walking on the Brooklyn bridge. Their fun is interrupted by Goldie's dad (Chris Mulkey) who demands she comes home, Legs gets enraged when he smacks her upside the head. Back at the house Legs then tells Maddy she lost her mother and that she has never seen her father since, they have a tender moment and enjoy the night sky. The next day one of the jock's girlfriends asks Maddy for a favor, but then she learns that it was a trap. Just as she is about to be sexually assaulted, Legs shows up and pulls a knife forcing the jocks to let Maddy go. The girls then proceed to hop in the car and take it for a joyride. Legs' reckless driving alerts cops on patrol, she refuses to pull over and the girls end up totaling the car by rolling it. \r\n\r\n  Though not seriously injured they are charged with carjacking, resisting arrest and assault with a deadly weapon. Cindy, the girlfriend lies to the judge and as a result Legs is forced to spend time in a youth correctional center. As the group is separated they start to flounder, Goldie runs away from home and joins a drug house. Cindy then goes back to the courthouse, feeling guilty for what she did and confesses to the judge that she lied. Maddy then learns of Goldie's whereabouts and brings her back to the house/ Legs is then released and makes her way back to the house, but her homecoming celebration is cut short. Maddy shows her Goldie, who is suffering from heroin withdrawal.\r\n\r\n  Legs then decides that the only way to get Goldie help is to get money from her father for rehab. Tension rises when he refuses, Legs then picks up a pistol and holds him at gunpoint. The girls then take him hostage and bring him back to the house. Legs gives the gun to Rita to hold, while she thinks about another idea. Maddy then realizes that she is holding Goldie's father for ransom, and then says that she is going about it all wrong. Legs then voices her frustration towards her own father. The girls then decide that he should see Goldie, who walks upstairs and spooks Rita. Rita accidentally fires the gun and it nicks his shoulder.\r\n\r\n  Maddy now realizing how dangerous and violent the situation has gotten urges the girls to take Goldie's father to a hospital. The girls then agree, but Maddy notices Legs is missing. She goes to look for her, and finds her thumbing for a ride on the Brooklyn bridge. Maddy approaches her and begs her to stay in Portland, but Legs persuades Maddy to join her on the road. They both make their decision, and Maddy watches as Legs boards a truck and watches it drive off. As Maddy proceeds to climb the bridge, we learn that Goldie and her dad got their relationship worked out. Maddy has gone on to be a successful artist and has traveled around the world. The girls manage to keep in touch, and even though they never saw Legs again they reminisce about the past.\r\n\r\nWhile the movie is critically panned, it was a box office success. It does not deviate from the original novel, it does has some stuff left out. However, the movie takes a creative license approach and I love that they modernized the story. The original story is about New York girls who form a gang in a post World War II New York City. This is easily a story anyone can read and think that it is more suited for modern-day. The movie relies heavily on misandry and feminism, as well as the rape culture. The casting is wonderfully done, Angelina is powerful as the femme-fatale Legs Sadovsky. Hedy Burress is charming as Maddy and the others can hold their own. Legs is the girl Maddy longs to be, while Maddy is the girl Legs needs. Maddy has morals and guidance while Legs is a rebel. One of the best scenes is the nighttime scene with Legs and Maddy on the roof as they watch the night sky.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you're a fan of the original novel then this is not for you. But, if you enjoy Indie films and are a fan of Angelina Jolie I highly recommend this movie. 4.5 out of 5 stars."], ["A funny movie.

Color of Night isn't just bad: it's bad with raisins in it.\r\n \r\n If you were one of the few who saw Color of Night in a theater, you probably remember the plot, but for those millions and millions who missed this gem, let's recap.\r\n \r\nBruce Willis stars as a psychologist. (Are you laughing too hard or can we go on now?) Willis is having a crisis of conscience/ confidence because one of his patients leaped out of a window after applying lots of lipstick. (We all know, don't we, that applying lots of lipstick is a sure sign of suicidal depression?) Anyway, Willis goes out to L.A. to visit fellow shrink Scott Bakula, who takes Willis to his group therapy session so that the fun can start in earnest. Remember \"The Bob Newhart Show\" from the '70's? His group therapy meetings weren't nearly as funny as these: we have a nympho, an obsessive-compulsive, a split personality, the Professor and Mary Ann -- well, you get the idea. Bakula gets killed in a scene that looks like Psycho directed by Mack Sennett. The sad part is that Bakula is the most talented and attractive member of the whole goddamn cast and 30 minutes into the picture he's been bumped off.\r\n\r\nWillis stays on in Bakula's grandiosely modern home (crammed with screamingly bad art) despite the fact that someone keeps stalking him and leaving snakes in the mailbox. (Are hotels in L.A. that expensive?) It's like the TV movie where that devil doll keeps chasing Karen Black around her apartment going, \"Yanni yanni yanni,\" and it never occurs to her to just leave.Instead of ruining the horribly implausible and helter-skelter plot for you, We'll just point out some of the more outrageous lapses of sanity: a) Willis's patient jumps out of a Manhattan office tower, causing pedestrians to scream and run, whereas real New Yorkers would have lifted her purse; b) Three days after famous psychologist Scott Bakula is killed in an exceedingly colorful way in his midtown office, his patients still don't know about it -- okay, we've already established that there are no reasonably priced hotels in L.A., but surely there must be at least one newspaper or TV station; c) The whole plot hook -- Willis goes color blind after seeing his patient's blood -- goes nowhere. Period. You keep thinking there has to be a reason for it or a plot twist that depends on it -- but nothing ever happens.\r\n\r\nThe film is a laugh riot and we don't want to give away all of the jokes. When we saw the film in the theater, the audience laughed all the way through the first sex scene, which took place underwater and was about as erotic as an Esther Williams movie. Oh, yes, we do get to see generous portions of Bruce Willis, though not as much as he'd have liked.\r\nThen there's the acting. Even the extras overact. Keep your eyes out for one unbilled woman playing a hooker in a police station. She only has one line, but she gives it such gusto that she will leave you stunned. Even formerly respected actors lose all sense of self-control; Lesley Ann Warren (decked out in a Shelley Long wig) twitches and twitters like a road company Billie Burke, and Ruben Blades does what appears to be a Jose Jimenez imitation. Willis actually seems like a model of intelligent understatement compared with the rest of the cast, but the truth is, he just wasn't acting at all.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's Jane March. Ever so much of Jane March. Watching her try to match wits with Bruce Willis really makes you appreciate the bang-up job Cybill Shepherd was doing all those years. Jane spends half the movie dressed in disguise as a teenage boy. (How hard is she to spot? She's got teeth like Bucky Beaver! This gal could eat corn on the cob through a picket fence!) It all just gets sillier and sillier until the grand finale, which tried to come off as Hitchcockian but reminded us more of silent film legend Harold Lloyd. Judging by the guffaws from the audience, we weren't alone. So, watch Color of Night if you're feeling down in the mouth. Just don't try to eat popcorn during it -- unless you know the Heimlich maneuver.", "Rare is the movie that benefits from addition. Color of Night is almost but not quite the exception that proves the rule. According to TV Tropes, \u201cThe director\u2019s cut [which runs 20 minutes longer than the theatrical release] restored \u2026 much of the film\u2019s humor.\u201d Not nearly enough of it, though; if the movie had truly embraced its comedic potential, it could have been the Naked Gun of erotic thrillers. \r\n\r\nLess than three minutes after he has been accused of being figuratively colorblind, psychologist Bill Capa (Bruce Willis) goes literally colorblind. To call this foreshadowing is an insult to prefixes. Bill loses the ability  to see the color red when one of his patients defenestrates herself (the dummy that takes the fall is so stiff it looks like it might start gliding away at any second). \r\n\r\nWhen the woman crash-lands on the street, we are treated to a shot of her bleeding face \u2014 from below; it\u2019s sort of like the Sunset Boulevard pool shot only instead of looking through water, we are somehow looking through pavement.\r\n\r\nA distraught Bill goes to visit his colleague and best friend Bob Moore (Scott Bakula) in Los Angeles. Bob invites Bill to sit in on a group therapy session, where one of the patients notices with amusement that Bill is wearing one red sock and one green sock \u2014 which of course looks only slightly more ridiculous than if either color actually matched.\r\n\r\nBob is soon stabbed to death in a scene that wouldn\u2019t be entirely out of place in the first Scary Movie, and that culminates with Bob crashing through a glass door \u2014 well, he actually doesn\u2019t so much crash through it as leans gently on it, at which point the door collapses like it was made of sugar glass as opposed to glass-glass, except for one particular shard that\u2019s bigger and sturdier than the rest; so much so, in fact, that poor Bob can\u2019t help impaling himself on it.\r\n\r\nAll five members of Bob\u2019s therapy group are suspects, though sadly only two are blatant red herrings. Now, if the film had taken itself much less seriously, a joke about Bill\u2019s inability to detect a red herring would have written itself; it would also have been funny if the entire group were composed of Usual Suspects (why not, for example, Ted Levine and Tom Noonan to complement Brad Dourif and Lance Henriksen?).\r\n\r\nBill takes over Bob\u2019s duties and in the process becomes the subject of a couple of unintentionally hilarious assassination attempts, including a rare Car Fu/Fallacy of the Predictable Tree hybrid \u2014 and who could forget the ol\u2019 Rattlesnake in the Mailbox?\r\n\r\nAs for the intercourse scenes, the norm is that you couldn\u2019t make sex funny if you tried; then again, director Richard Rush wasn\u2019t trying, and that\u2019s how come we get, among other things, a toy tank used as a sex toy (doubly weird because this occurs in a bathtub, so shouldn\u2019t it be a toy boat?), and a scene in which, even though he\u2019s off-screen, you can hear (and then can never, ever un-hear) the exact moment when Bill grunts his way to climax.\r\n\r\nOh, and there\u2019s also a sardonically wisecracking homicide detective played by Rub\u00e9n Blades who, in a moment of self-awareness bordering on self-parody, mercilessly mocks the other characters for being so dumb (\u201cHow in the name of God could all of you be going out with the same woman and not know? Not have a clue? \u2026 I\u2019m gonna call the Guinness Book of World Records because I think this woman deserves credit. And I\u2019m gonna make sure that all of your names are included so you can all share in the glory\u201d).

When the would-be musician breaks her hip while in a drunken stupor, she undergoes surgery to repair the damaged joint, but, while recovering in the hospital, she\u2019s assigned to a semi-private room with a cantankerous old woman who only speaks Polish, Antonina (Margaret Sophie Stein).

If you consider the tower as a kind of true main character of the movie.  \r\n\r\nOn first watching this I can instantly imagine the blustering cacophony of outrage about climbing technique from viewers.  From the first, the film is rather jarring but honest about its juvenile depiction of \"climbing\".  At the start I had to decide NOT to care about how realistic it was because it would be wrong to reduce a film abductio absurdum because it is a story after all.  A creation.  It isn't being judged on its ability to remind one of real life so much as to forget it.  I do this 'forgetting' voluntarily and I seem to enjoy films more. \r\n\r\nI felt my body constricting away slightly and getting anxious during the gravity yawning scenes, 2000ft above the ground!  The characters were reckless enough to believe they would die at almost any time.  It was unrelenting in the tension.  \r\n\r\nEven if the writing is kind of silly at times, there are elements in a film, perhaps shown through other mediums besides the writing itself that can raise the score of the film quite a bit. Consider the cinematography.  The deft and skilled work at showing the tension existing in every moment by rattling bolts in close up with uncanny metallic sounds protesting the extra weight.  The drone shots that highlight the mind bending fear of such a radical location.   Honestly!  It seemed like such a labor of love of the filmmakers.  They immediately saw how much could be done with the location.\r\n\r\n  The story felt like a vehicle for the film which was this awesome gigantic testament to the fear of heights.  The movie poster sold this one for me because I was thinking, well, even if it isn't that good, the idea itself is good enough to be fascinating.  Consider the main character of the movie: the tower itself.  It said nothing the entire time, but it was the star of every scene.   Such as it was, the story was like kind of this extra fluff that you had to deal with, but what a cool film.  \r\n\r\nThere was an amazing number of times I was 'triggered' by how silly and unrealistic the climbing aspects were, and how insanely reckless it became.  However, I don't believe that anyone thinks this a film to be studying climbing from.  It isn't even showing climbing's artistic nature which is the film's biggest pitfall.  I loved how the arc centered around conquering your fears through this metaphorical path of climbing and I'm sure a lot of climbers embraced that, and were reminded of it, but it was a crime to leave out why the characters are pursuing this passion.", "**Fall is 47 Meters Down but with heights instead of depths - 47 Meters Up.**\r\n\r\nFall keeps your stomach in your throat with its dizzying heights and anxiety-inducing peril.

Grace Curry and Virginia Gardner\u2019s despair seemed authentic through their convincing performances. Panic and distress filled every shot as the camera soaked in the unbelievable heights and endless landscapes.

Understood that you erect a 2000ft television relay tower back in the day, but when that industry moves to satellite delivery, why on Earth would anyone just leave this gradually rusting structure standing - only for it to come crashing down one day when the metal fatigue has won out? Hmmm! Anyway, luckily for us the planner's ineptitude allowed for \"Becky\" (Grace Caroline Currey) and her friend \"Hunter\" (Virginia Gardner) to go climb it. It's quite a big deal for the former woman - she had been free-climbing almost one year earlier with her friend and her husband \"Dan\" (Mason Gooding) when disaster struck and she has spent much of the intervening period married to Jack Daniels. Scorning any sensible planning - food, gloves etc. up they go - there is a ladder - and are soon at the top surveying the immensity of the view. Time to go down, the ladder gives way. The two are lucky to have the platform right at the top to take refuge on, but their bag - water and drone contained within - falls 50 feet and balances precariously on a redundant satellite dish below. What's to do? The plot really does take a quite cynical turn when they fire a flare to attract the attention of some men in a nearby camper van, only for the guys to spot them and then proceed to steal their car! Otherwise, this is really just a remarkable feat of photography that certainly had my palms sweating. Director Scott Mann and the cinematographer (MacGregor) do manage to effectively draw us into the two friend's predicament and if you are even vaguely acrophobic, then this film can be a really tough watch at times. Sadly, though, in the search for characterisation we discover that even at altitude, there is a place for a rather tiresome melodrama. Thereafter it is quite difficult to warm to either of the women who are being harried by some hungry buzzards as they perch! The ending is not good. To be fair, it isn't straightforward either, it has a few quirks to keep us on our toes - but they are not terribly realistic quirks. Enjoy is not the correct word for this film - I cannot say I was too relaxed for much of my time in the cinema tonight, but if this is to be seen at all, then it does need that big screen. On television it will lose much of it's photographic impact and that really is all this film is worth watching for - the acting and repetitive \"Are you OK?\" dialogue leaves much to be desired.", "**might contain spoilers**\r\n\r\nWhat a great murder mystery film. As an amateur climber, I too was initially put off by the amount of unprofessional climbing techniques. However, if they were truly climbing/solo enthusiasts, how could they not get injured way before they take on any big challenges? (And from a filmmaking perspective, with climbing being such a popular sports, surly it is not hard to get some random joe from the gym to tell the film crew that those techniques are horrible! also there are other suspicious common-sense defying points later\u2026) The answer of course, what we watched is just simply a **recounting of Becky\u2019s version of what transpired!!!** Then all the inaccuracies makes perfect sense as that\u2019s how you get the authorities to believe why the \u201caccidents\u201d happened in the first place \u2014 sheer negligence and amateur skills!\r\n\r\nI believe what happened was that Becky found out that she was cheated on, then plotted to get rid of the asshat by either screwing with the cam placements and/or - as filmed but with a malignant intent - to get rid of the rope too liberally. And no one else knows exactly how good the cam placements are or whether they were tempered with - Hunter is way above them busy down-climbing!\r\n\r\nThen, this explains perfectly her year-long depression as even if not fully planned out, her imo premeditated actions naturally put herself in even deeper sense of guilt.\r\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the forever unknowable fact that whether the tower trips is truly initiated by Hunter. Possibly Becky saw Hunter is living a guilt-free life and had another urge for murder and proposed to feed Hunter this great youtube/instagram clickbait trip to convince her to come along! Although the film depicts that Hunter is very heartwarming at times, it\u2019s entirely plausible that Hunter **is** in fact the care-free personality that she demonstrates in **all her videos online!** (which might makes her more murderable in Becky\u2019s eye). So Becky could be using a very high-IQ way of framing her victims as compassionate sweethearts.\r\n\r\nFinally, the biggest telltale sign that the final accident is premeditated (and possibly intended by the filmcrew/writer) is that when Becky lastly went for Hunter\u2019s body to drop down the phone, she **instinctively \u2014 rightfully so for a climber** clipped the carabiner to the lowest stable point which is the as yet unbroken ladder!!!(and the film gave this a real good close-up) Why on earth wouldn\u2019t Hunter do that when she went down to retrieve the bag???!!! This is not just bad climbing, this defies common sense! We were all screaming how stupid it was of Hunter to do what she did in the bag sequence and now we know, **these are all extremely likely fabrications recounted by Becky at the end of the accident!**\r\n\r\nLastly, some keen chinese filmgoers also noted the \u201cmistake\u201d on the poster where in fact **the ladders are failing while Becky\u2019s at the top and Hunter is still climbing!** Maybe this is a hint from the production team ;)\r\n\r\n**welp anyways it\u2019s just a theory :p I probably watched too many asian sope-operas**", "I can\u2019t help having a soft spot for a movie that name-drops several pro wrestlers as a means to convey a nice bit of subtle foreshadowing, and plays Warrants \u00abCherry Pie\u00bb on its soundtrack like every five minutes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s very difficult to empathize with the characters in this film; anyone who climbs a rusty, super creaky 2,000 foot TV tower (a choice so inane that under normal circumstances it\u2019s known as the Fallacy of the Climbing Villain) in the middle of bumfuck nowhere just for shits and giggles deserves whatever\u2019s coming to them. \r\n\r\nThe rationale, such as it is, behind the protagonists\u2019 actions is that life is \u00abtoo short\u00bb and \u00abyou gotta do something that makes you feel alive.\u00bb Methinks they\u2019re confusing joie de vivre with having a fucking death wish. According to these people\u2019s logic, Bobby De Niro and Chris Walken were really sucking the marrow out of life in those Russian roulette scenes from The Deer Hunter.  \r\n\r\nNow, that climbing artificial structures (known as buildering as well as several other names) is a reckless (not to mention illegal) thing to do doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that those who do it take it lightly. I\u2019m sure a lot of planning and prepping and getting in shape mentally and physically (even the relatively simple act of climbing a ladder becomes a Herculean labor when the ladder is twice as tall as the Eiffel Tower) precedes the actual deed.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t see any of that here; not even a training montage. For Hunter (Virginia Gardner) and Becky (Grace Caroline Currey) it\u2019s an overnight decision; sure, Hunter says she\u2019s has \u00abplanned\u00bb it, and she\u2019s some sort of daredevil You Tuber, but Becky is an out-of-practice rock climber who has ostensibly become a drunken slob in the year since her husband\u2019s Disney Villain Death. \r\n\r\nAll of the above notwithstanding, the film certainly makes the most of its chosen setting. The landscape around the top of the tower (consisting of a \u00abpizza-size platform\u00bb) betrays a green screen quality to it, but this is a rare occasion in which this actually works in the movie\u2019s favor; at such dizzying heights, wouldn\u2019t the world and everything in it look surreal? Or, to put it more bluntly, wouldn\u2019t your perception get all screwed up? \r\n\r\nMoreover, the stunts don\u2019t flat-out take your breath away, but they do kind of borrow it for a little while, which is better than nothing; also, there\u2019s a certain measure of suspense regarding whether or not help is on the way \u2014 and while this is the only movie that I can think of where the audience is left literally waiting for the other shoe to drop, this aspect of the plot actually involves a pretty neat shot of, well, a shoe dropping.", "**_Fall_** is a survival thriller that succeeds, at least for those of us with the fear of heights, to get an uneasy feeling with the aerial shots.

Its premise automatically brings high levels of adrenaline, suspense, and tension - especially for acrophobes - and Scott Mann achieves the ideal mix of realism and absurdity.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't go overboard to the point of causing countless \"eye rolls\", nor is it too generic and inconsequential, adding a rather impactful narrative twist near the third act. Grace Caroline Currey shines alongside an also competent Virginia Gardner, both having enough time to lead a character-driven story focused mainly on a single location.\r\n\r\nToo bad the frustratingly abrupt ending prevents the movie from reaching the next level...\"\r\n\r\nRating: B", "Going into Fall, I did not have super high hopes, and unfortunately it met my expectations. This movie attempts to be something far greater than it ever needed to be, resulting in a super bloated experience that just feels completely unfocused. The nearly two-hour runtime is entirely too long for a plot that is on the surface, fairly bare bones. But the screenplay attempts to deliver multiple subplots that are supposed to develop our characters, but all it did was take away from the tension that it was building. For every scene where I was gripping my chair waiting to see what will happen next, there is a scene where the two characters talk about their feelings for far too long. Furthermore, there are story elements that are either too convenient or exist solely as obstacles for the sake of obstacles which detract from the overall believability.\r\n\r\nI do think Grace Caroline Currey is going to have a fantastic future in this industry, but her performance alongside Virginia Gardner left a lot to be desired. Currey did her best to save a pretty horrendous script, but it just was not enough. Despite this, the movie was directed fairly well, with great shots of the tower and of the action that was ensuing. The cinematography was fantastic, with beautiful skyboxes and sharp silhouettes of our protagonists that I particularly enjoyed.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this film would have been much better if it had stuck to being a cheesy thriller with a bare bones plot. All the extra filler really weighed down the overall experience.\r\n\r\nScore: 35% \ud83d\udca9\r\nVerdict: Bad"], [], [], ["OK, hands up - I'm a fan of Rupert Graves. Ever since his \"Scudder\" in \"Maurice\" (1987) he has been able to do little wrong. Here, he is the likeable dosser \"Alan\" who accidentally witnesses a mob-style hit in London. The killers know someone saw them and so he must keep one step ahead as they close in. Luckily for him, the crime has attracted the attention of journalist \"Billie\" (Annabella Sciorra) but can she help keep him alive as he faces pursuit from bent copper \"Matheson\" (Michael Gambon) and his paymaster \"Cavani\" (Franco Nero)? As British crime efforts go, this is OK - a decent cast present a reasonably paced drama with just about enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. Sadly, though, the dialogue is straight out an episode of \"The Sweeney\"; Gambon is nowhere near his best and Nero features just a bit too sparingly to make much of an impact. The illuminated London skyline offers some added menace, and though the ending is really rather poor, director Scott Michell still takes a little time to try to develop the lead characters.

Well Leslie Howard engenders exactly that feeling as he plays the hapless, lovestruck \"Philip\" who has fallen in love with the nasty, scheming \"Mildred\" - Bette Davis (with a rather dodgy English agent). The chemistry between the two of them is great. She treats him appallingly, yet like a doting puppy he comes back for more each time. John Cromwell keeps this going deftly; we see the characterisations from W. Somerset Maugham's novel unfold before us and I felt genuinely invested.", "Early on in Of Human Bondage Philip Carey (Leslie Howard) is told \u201cYou will never be anything but mediocre.\u201d Soon after, Mildred Rogers is described as \u201canemic \u2026 ill-natured and contemptible.\u201d Neither will ever do anything to disprove these assessments. Carey especially will never be able to overcome his weakness; he was literally born with a clubfoot, but his real problem is that he never develops a figurative spine. We leave the film convinced that, had Mildred not died, Carey would have kept taking her back in at the expense of far worthier women \u2013 worthier than Mildred, yes, but worthier than him as well.\r\n\r\nNow, as mediocre and contemptible as Carey and Mildred are \u2013 and they take mediocrity and contempt to heights, or rather lows, that arguably have yet to be matched almost a century later \u2013, there is a sort of astronomical fascination in watching them follow their preordained trajectories; they\u2019re like heavenly bodies fixed in their orbits, she a star going supernova and he a barren planet becoming engulfed in the ensuing blast.\r\n\r\nBondage is a mixed bag to say the least for Howard, even if Philip Carey isn\u2019t \u2013 though not by much either \u2013 the most thankless role in his career; five years later he would go on to play the equally insipid Ashley Wilkes in Gone with the Wind, opposite two other legends in the same league as Davis. \r\n\r\nI will say a couple of things for the Carey character, though; number one, he\u2019s fun to watch, not because of what Howard does with it (which is, wisely as it turns out, next to nothing), but because of what goes on in his febrile mind \u2013 i.e., his obsession with Mildred, whom he sees everywhere when awake and dreams about when asleep, and which the film manifests through some very neat optical effects (my favorite is a classroom skeleton that takes on Mildred\u2019s likeness, in what may be construed as a bit of reverse foreshadowing). And number two, Howard\u2019s pale shadow of a man makes Davis look even better than she already does \u2013 which is a lot \u2013, not that she really needs the help. \r\n\r\nBeautiful though she was, Davis always had a gift for the grotesque (which reached its zenith in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?), and with Mildred she has no trouble conveying, through her faux ing\u00e9nue fa\u00e7ade, the character\u2019s inner moral corruption and physical decay; of particular note is her climactic The Reason You Suck Speech to Carey (and even then it\u2019s hard to sympathize with him, since most if not all the s--- that she calls him on is pretty much true)."], ["Decent enough 1980s-era espionage action-thriller that pretty much combines Atomic Blonde, Red Sparrow and Besson's La Femme Nikita.

But Anna doesn't even manage to entertain. The screen time is chewed up by developing her undercover identity, her various romances, hurts, betrayals, and very little subterfuge or action. Anna might have been released in theaters, but it was the quality of a direct-to-stream b-movie that had the dreams of a bigger budget film.

She has the looks, the beauty - and the ninja skills, and is soon proving very effective and attracting the attention of the CIA in the form of \"Miller\" (Cillian Murphy). Quickly she, he, and her Soviet mentor are all caught up in a rather predictable game of cat and mouse. This has got really nothing to help it to stand out or to redeem the repetitive nature of the story. Fight, escape, fight, escape... It's all so routine, and frankly dull. Evans and Dame Helen deliver accents that are as thick as last months Tiramisu and though she does enter into the spirit off her character, Luss just doesn't cut through at all as the ambidextrous and glamorous assassin.

It provides for a good role for James Mason as the drunkard solicitor \"Sawyer\" - a bright, intelligent operator who has hits the skids somewhat after his wife abandoned him, and he became oddly estranged from his daughter \"Angela\" (an effective, almost aloof Geradine Chaplin), with whom he shares a home. Otherwise, the rest of the roles are weak, wet even. When her boyfriend \"Jo\" (Paul Bertoya) is accused of a murder, \"Sawyer\" determines to raise his game and defend the young man. To be fair, this is a small tour de force for the star, who does deliver well. The rest of the story borders on the facile. The collective surrounding \"Angela\" - a bunch of wealthy no-hope wasters with Bobby Darin and a very dapper looking Ian Ogilvy, are thoroughly disengaging and but for a suitably grumpy performance from James Hayter as chief magistrate \"Hawkins\" one could reasonably be forgiven for reaching for the fast forward button. The ending, doubtless a superlative piece of deduction from Mason is almost irrelevant - by this point I really couldn't care less about any of the characters and, indeed, may well have reached for a glass myself (it's not yet 10am, so perhaps not!).

Yet I'd never got around to actually watching it. I'd bought it (twice) off the back of it being this enormous cult classic weighed down with critical praise (Wiki tells me that the readers of Total Film magazine voted it the third greatest comedy film of all time in 2000 and the 13th greatest British film of all time in 2004, it was ranked 38th greatest film of all time by Channel 4 in 2001 in their 100 Greatest Films poll, an Observer poll of 60 eminent British filmmakers and critics voted it 2nd best British film of the last 25 years in 2009, it ranked 118 in Empire magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Films of All Time in 2008). Anyways: This film has so far mugged me for a fiver. 2/10, and I'm being generous. What a pile of rubbish! \"Third greatest comedy\"?!? I would never EVER in a thousand years pegged it as a \"comedy\", under any measurable criteria. It wasn't just trying-yet-failing to be funny, I wasn't even aware it was trying to be funny. Literally, the ONLY funny thing about the movie was how anyone on Earth could have thought this was a good film. Basically: It's the late sixties, and two posh, \"luvvy\" actors (the titular \"Withnail\" and \"I\", played capably enough by two posh, \"luvvy\" actors: Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann, respectively), living in absolute filth like a couple of retards - I mean, they don't seem to have any understanding of how to operate, say, the kitchen sink - decide that they need to go for a break in the countryside, at a cottage owned by Withnail's gay uncle. They go, it pisses down ceaselessy, they fail to get on with the natives simply because they're such unlikeable morons, then the gay uncle shows up and spends the rest of the movie creepily and ceaselessly trying to gay off with Paul McGann's unnamed \"I\" character. They go home, they tolerate a drug-dealer and his friend who have broken into and taken up residence in their house, \"I\" gets an acting job offer and takes off. The end. Utter rubbish. In fact, I'm making it sound better than it is. Reading it back, it sounds vaguely like an admittedly particularly poor episode of Bottom played dramatically rather than for laughs, and although there are shades of the Rick/Rich character that Rik Mayall has played his entire career in Richard E. Grant's performance, Withnail & I is NOT even as good as a poor Bottom episode. And I didn't like Bottom either, especially.", "A beautiful, dreary and funny film.  At times subtle and others direct.  Deeply contemplative with majestic scenery and an atmosphere of grey.  Sardonic humour with believable, excellently acted characters and scenarios.  It's the greatest film about friendship and only gets better with each viewing.  The direction is purely cinematic and shows rather than tells. A Masterpiece.", "**It's a good film, but it's very damaged by the abuse of alcohol, drugs and tobacco, and by the weakness of the script, in terms of narrative.**\r\n\r\nI expected a lot more from this movie, I have to confess. It is considered by many to be one of the best British comic films, and there is no doubt that the dialogues and situations were extremely funny, and it is not difficult to laugh at the absurd situations and conversations that are observed here. But it's also no lie that the film is far from being a work of perfection.\r\n\r\nThe script is based on the coexistence between two characters, Withnail and another boy, whose name is never mentioned, and who supposedly tells the story in the first person. They are two aspiring actors, absolutely failed, penniless and sharing expenses and an apartment in Camden during the late 60s, that is, in the midst of the cultural revolution and the golden years of drug use. Tired of the rot in which they live, they decide to go to the country house of a Withnail's uncle, not knowing that the place is inhospitable for the city dwellers.\r\n\r\nThe film has its moments, and this is largely due to a well written set of dialogues and absurd situations. Particularly memorable is the way in which Withnail practically deifies alcohol, not being able to remain sober for a minute, or the way in which he decides to go fishing with a shotgun, or even the journey of the two friends, in a beautiful old Jaguar that is truly a shame to see so mistreated. Unfortunately, the script and story don't go much further than this, and there isn't much material to support the film. On a narrative level, it is decidedly a very weak film. However, I was able to easily deal with it.\r\n\r\nThe film will only be as good as the audience is willing to \u201clet it flow\u201d without thinking too much about it, simply taking advantage of the many comic opportunities created. More than once, I felt that the film would work perfectly as a stage play, even more so than in the cinema. Very difficult to digest, however, is the constant apology for alcohol and drugs. I am sure that this was not the intention of the producers, but the fact that the characters are under the use of these substances for so long can really bother current audiences, who view the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and drugs in cinema less sympathetically. I tend to be quite open about this, but several times, in several scenes, I felt that the film was treading on dangerous ground in this regard.\r\n\r\nThe film has a reduced cast and only three actors deserve a mention. Richard Grant and Paul McGann made their cinematic debut with this film\u2026 and what a debut! Grant, perhaps without ever having imagined it, had the role of his career in this film, as no other work of his was as popular and as remarkable as this one. McGann was also very good, although he is not able to compete much with Grant, who has a much more intense and complex character. The late and late Richard Griffiths also appears here and plays a small role, but one that is very well done.\r\n\r\nThe film is not brilliant on a technical level, but there are some points I would like to highlight, the cinematography being the most relevant of them all. I don't know how this was achieved, but it is very evident that the film was able to emulate the look and characteristics of a film made in the 60s. I believe that the secret was in the light, in choosing the right film and the most suitable camera, as well as a good set of costumes and props. I especially enjoyed seeing Withnail's costume. In his clothes, he looks like a seedy, broke, alcoholic Mr. Darcy. There are also some visually notable scenes, like the roadside scenes, or the scene where the two friends leave Monty's house, and we see the stately demolition of an old Victorian house behind them.", "Just what exactly was it lurking in the sink? Probably best not to know as we meet the dipso \"Withnail\" (Richard E. Grant) and his marginally more respectable pal who'd be the \"Marwood/I\" (Paul McGann). Two \"resting\" actors who haven't tuppence to rub together. A visit to his gay uncle \"Monty\" (Richard Grffiths) provides them with some fine wine and with the key to his remote country cottage where they duly adjourn for an holiday. They don't exactly fit in, indeed having no money, firewood, fuel or much of a clue just antagonises the locals. The bracing country air - and the relentless rain - just isn't for them, and their situation only gets worse when \"Uncle\" comes a calling and takes a bit of a shine to the frankly rather terrified \"Marwood\"! What happens next? The first hour of this is great fun, with Grant and McGann working well together delivering a pithy and ripe script that is peppered with quick-wittedness and dry humour. I'm not sure just how much acting Griffiths was actually doing here, but he steals the scene every time - especially as he closes in on his would-be, hapless, prey in the middle of a thunderstorm! Plaudits also to their mate \"Danny\" (Ralph Brown) - a sort of urban sophisticate who's permanently stoned! The cast is tightly knit and though it does lose steam towards the end, I reckon it's still one of the best examples of comedy reflecting a side of 1980s Britain that steers clear of the obvious Mrs. Thatcher-bashing, but still offers quite a keen assessment of the triumph of expectation over hope!

But a film doesn't become popular or iconic just for that... there are films that are so admittedly bad and strange that, in a way, they become remarkable and enter the so-called popular memory or collective memory. _Barbarella_ is a film inspired by a 60's comic book, and both the original material and the film itself were very influenced by the \u201chippie\u201d culture, the libertarian ideas of May 68 and the Sexual Revolution. It was a time when eroticism became popular and massively sought after and exploited by the arts. Only if we understand this can we understand why this film is the way it is.\r\n\r\nDespite doing justice to the source material, the script tells a story so fanciful and idiotic that only someone from that time could appreciate it: Barbarella is (I really don't want to have to take this stereotype, but it's blatant) a dumb blonde, immensely attractive, who is sent by Planet Earth to another galaxy, in search of a lost scientist and the weapons he had. She comes into contact with various aliens and is almost always seduced or \"convinced\" into having sex. At a certain point, she becomes involved in a rebellion against a queen of a perverse city, where they try to kill her in a machine that causes an \"overdose\" of sexual pleasure. Obviously, this fails, and the movie ends with the blonde astronaut winning.\r\n\r\nI didn't see sex scenes in the film, but the character appears half-naked many times, which then was truly revolutionary \u2013 almost pornographic. For us, the way she is seduced is so clearly misogynistic that in some cases it would be a crime, and it's hard for me to think that the film was so calmly received, but those were other times. If this film were released now, without a doubt, it would be so controversial for its sexist sexuality that I think the feminist movements would boycott it. Also, the dialogues, the situations and the whole concept of the movie are pretty dumb.\r\n\r\nThe film was a French-American production and a good part of the cast is French-speaking, and I would like to highlight, on the positive side, the participation of the great Marcel Marceau, in a small but relevant speaking role. The director was Roger Vadim, and then he was married to the actress and sex symbol Jane Fonda, who, thus, secured the protagonist role. For future memory exist the statements, by the actress and the director, about Fonda's insecurity about herself and the way she didn't feel comfortable with the character and her nudity. Even so, and despite everything, Fonda did what she could with the terrible material she was given. We can still positively highlight the contributions of John Phillip Law and Anita Pallenberg.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film stands out for its futuristic \u201ctrash\u201d scenography, evident, for example, in the protagonist's ship and in the city of Sogo. It can be visually horrible, an attack on good taste or logic, but back then it was something quite avant-garde, as were the costumes, particularly Barbarella's sexy spacesuits (which could almost be used as bathing suits). The rest is pretty bad: the cinematography is boring and dull, the camera work is average, the soundtrack is kitsch.", "I can't help but wonder what Jane Fonda might think if she were to look back on this sexy sci-fi nonsense from 50 years ago. It is not alone in being terrible - there were plenty of drug-induced/enhanced films made in the late 60s so as to render this particular effort indeterminable from many others; but the fact that Fonda took on this role as an intergalactic space cadet on the search for \"Durand Durand\" and his (euphemistic ?) \"Positronic Ray\" is what is astonishing. The script is dreadful, the props buyer obviously didn't have the budget to stretch beyond paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and bubble-wrap and the synthesised music is only marginally more interesting than that you might have heard in a Soviet lift around the same time. John Philip Law was already in his 30's when he agreed to dress in a large nappy and don some huge angelic wings as \"Pygar\" and Anita Pallenberg \"The Great Tyrant\" was pretty much never seen on screen again. It has acquired cult status, but as is usual with most similarly described films - nobody is ever truly sure why...", "Got the new Arrow Video 4K release and decided to give this another watch.

That's a big surprise, considering the downward trajectory of the preceding two. Don't get me wrong, it's close to being a not so good film. However, for me, it just about floats above the required marker. I like it, can't lie.", "**Despite the heavy reviews and the public's disinterest, it's not as bad a movie as they say, and it was able to end the franchise on a positive note.**\r\n\r\nAfter three very interesting films, the \u201cKarate Kid\u201d franchise had to continue, and a fourth film was made, this time with a young girl in place of the apprentice (Ralph Macchio was too old for the character, and he had no interest in calling more his image and career to the universe of martial arts films). It was a risky move, but necessary if they wanted the franchise to continue... but the public didn't buy in, despite the movie itself not being as bad as they say. In fact, I even consider it to be better than its immediate predecessor. With a weak box office result, largely as a result of the public's loss of interest in karate films, the film killed the franchise for a few decades, but I have no doubt that it was able to end it on a positive note.\r\n\r\nThe script is simple, but not without its flaws: Miyagi attends a military ceremony honoring the dead of his military unit, and ends up meeting the daughter of an ex-comrade-in-arms, Julie. She is a withdrawn young woman, with problems and angry due to the death of her parents in an accident. He decides to take her as a karate apprentice, it being obvious that she has a series of problems with other violent teenagers and will have to use martial arts to defend herself, but predictability is an agenda present throughout the film, which is not brings anything substantially new to the franchise. The film basically contains the same ideas and structure as its predecessors. The end of the movie is pretty hard to believe.\r\n\r\nDespite the problems, the film brings back Pat Morita, who has already won us over with the friendliness and good humor of his character, and with an always very committed interpretation. He has always been fundamental to the success of the films in this franchise, and his funny and charismatic presence is even more important here, in a film where he assumes even more presence and protagonism. Hillary Swank is still extremely young in this film and is a long way from the glory days she will live in years to come, but she shows charisma and presence, and a latent talent that needs to be polished. The film also has the participation of Michael Ironside and Michael Cavalieri, in the role of the two main villains, both of which are predictable, flat and underdeveloped, but still worthy of our dislike.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it is a very discreet film, which invests more in discreet effects and in a clear sound and image than in more flashy things. The movie's pacing is slower than its predecessors, and that takes some of the fun out of the movie, makes it more sleepy, but it's not a serious problem. The cinematography and editing are good enough, as are the choice of filming locations, the design of the sets (in particular the monastery) and the costumes. Finally, but just as importantly, the action and fight scenes were good enough and very well choreographed, and while some thought they were too sparse, I thought they were more interesting than the two preceding films in the franchise.", "Well, let's be honest, this one does clean up the problematic white patriarchy exhibited in the three other films, but it still stereotypes Asian people as....\r\n\r\n....I fooled you didn't I? Yeah, I'm not at all one of those people.\r\n\r\nWhatever, no one is going to read this anyway.\r\n\r\nI do, however, feel the need to give this two stars on principle. I mean, I did remember that they made this film when Part III was (possibly) blocked from my memory to save myself the horror of it all... but that I don't think it deserves that.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a kid, actually a Freshman in High School, I kind of had the attitude that no Ralph Macchio meant it wasn't a real Karate Kid film. I'd rather not see it made and I went out of my way not to watch it until I caught it on cable.\r\n\r\nI'd like to think I've matured since, but they are rebooting Blade and...no Snipes. The same attitude applies. I guess I haven't grown.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it's not just the lack of Macchio, it's the addition of Ironside doing his absolutely best impersonation of Michael Ironside and over-acting to the point where I'm actually shocked the rest of the cast made it through without groaning. He's kind of like Nicholas Cage without the charisma isn't he?\r\n\r\nMoving on, Swank does an OK job of selling it physically. I mean, I'm a pretty big guy, I was certainly a big guy in High School, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that she could kick my behind from here to kingdom come. Unfortunately, as much as she does sell the physicality of the role, it doesn't take a trained eye to see she doesn't know the fundamentals of even a basic street brawl.\r\n\r\nShe made up for it later in here career, but it still leaves you with the impression that she never threw a real punch in her life.\r\n\r\nAnd that, combined with Ironside is enough to really make this movie a flop, even if it had Macchio in it... which it doesn't, and I'm still going to be juvenile and insist it can't be a Karate Kid film without him."], [], ["If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI... am... in shock. The Turning had tons of development issues, switching directors (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo was the first choice), cast, producers (Steven Spielberg was once responsible for the project), and who knows what else. It's yet another adaptation of the famous ghost story, Turn of the Screw by Henry James, so it was always going to be a challenging task to bring a horror flick with something unique that the others didn't possess. After so many changes, the film finally decided on Mackenzie Davis as the adult protagonist, and Finn Wolfhard and Brooklynn Prince as the young kids.\r\n\r\nThey replaced everything and everyone, except the people who are behind the main reason why this movie fails so miserably: the screenwriters. With all due respect to the Hayes brothers, but this is the worst kind of a bad film. It doesn't have a single redeemable quality about it. It's a movie about... nothing! It has no message, no purpose, no structure, and last but not least: there's no ending. I'm not joking, The Turning doesn't have an ending. It's like someone abruptly shouts \"roll credits\" way before any sort of payoff is delivered.\r\n\r\nThe whole film is a collection of repetitive, dull scenes that only vary in location. Scareless and predictable jump scare sequences spread throughout the entire runtime with no meaning or objective underneath. Close to ninety minutes of build-up to utterly nothing. This isn't one of those cases where the ending is just ambiguous, and people can interpret it in several ways. As baffling as it might sound, this monotonous, cliche, boring horror movie doesn't possess an ending. I have to repeat it, so you actually believe what I'm writing.\r\n\r\nEven if I simply ignore that last (nonexistent) act, the rest of the film is still awful. As the viewer, knowing more than the main character about what's happening or what's about to unravel is almost always a lousy aspect concerning the horror genre. Not only there's a lack of a scary or eerie environment, but the narrative raises dozens of logical questions that eventually get no answer. The movie actually starts reasonably okay, it got me slightly invested in Davis' character, but it quickly becomes one of the most yawning-inducing experiences I've had this year.\r\n\r\nUsually, I can turn to the acting to help me get through the hardest portions of the film. However, Mackenzie Davis (who I liked a lot in Terminator: Dark Fate) gradually starts to become uninteresting, and Finn Wolfhard delivers the worst performance I've ever seen from him. Brooklynn Prince is good for her age, but she's still a 9-year-old kid, so... you know. Barbara Marten is probably the best as Mrs. Grose, but just like the movie itself, she has no real impact on anything. Technically, the score is weird, and instead of elevating the scary sequences, it turns them into a rock concert. The editing also lacks consistency.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I thought that Fantasy Island was a safe bet for the \"Worst Movie of 2020\" prize, but The Turning just entered the race. As logically absurd as the former might be, at least it has an ending. It's a ridiculous one, but it's, in fact, an ending. The latter not only lacks a payoff to the ninety minutes of build-up, but it has absolutely no redeeming quality. Describing a film in a one-word sentence was never this easy: \"nothing\". It's a movie about nothing! No meaning, no message, no purpose, no logical sense. An extremely boring journey through a mansion with predictable jump scares, an awkward score, and disappointing acting. It's an emotionless story packed with unanswered questions, and no, it's not one of those \"ambiguous narrative\" cases. I definitely don't recommend it, unless you desire that frustration of watching an incomplete film.\r\n\r\nRating: F", "Can a horror movie get by on nothing but atmosphere, on the je ne sais quoi of its unsettling mood? Sure, just take a look at Oz Perkins' 'I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House'. And Lenny Abrahamson's brilliantly underrated 'The Little Stranger' is barely a horror movie at all - it's more of an impeccably crafted chamber drama with a supernatural bent. These films prove that there's room in the world for this sort of old-dark-house story. But, as we see with 'The Turning', making scares stick means more than just building a spook house, dropping a few spiders inside, shoving audiences through the door, and hoping for the best.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-turning-henry-james-haunting-masterpiece-gets-the-conjuring-treatment", "The Turn of the Screw, a book written by Henry James, is considered one of the most influential Gothic horror books ever written, which, in turn, gave rise to one of the most influential classics of cinematic terror: The Innocents (1961). Of course, when hearing rumors of a possible new adaptation of this classic work, a person tends to fear the worst, as it will be difficult to achieve the splendor of the original film. In this way, can Chill be at the level of the original? The answer is a round no, this film only serves to confirm the initial fear caused by the announcement of this new adaptation. \r\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, the film manages to build a Gothic atmosphere, out of a tale from the era, with beautiful cinematography, centered on the house and the estate and its eminent threat to the new tenant. However, atmosphere, a decent performance and a promising start cannot save the film from a confused and uninspired script.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the original work remains (although, for no apparent reason, it happens now during the 90s), a young caretaker is called to work in the decrepit and old Bly mansion, a mansion inhabited by two brothers whose parents died, Miles (who in this version, loses any kind of threat adjacent to her character) and Flora, and by a maid in charge of looking after orphans. After a few days at the mansion, the janitor begins to experience paranormal phenomena.\r\n\r\nHowever, and unlike the original film, this new version of the events is not built with the same type of ambiguity as to the existence of frightening phenomena, it does not use psychological terror in a really effective way, considering itself more intelligent than in the reality is. The film introduces some interesting ideas, but lets them fall into the deepest clich\u00e9s of the genre (like the use of jump scares), and apart from one or the other chilling sequence, the film just doesn't know how to be scary.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems in the film is the use of special effects on ghosts, which remove any kind of frightening effect that simplicity could have offered them, and which make the few ghost appearances ineffective. Given that the appearances are sporadic and the characters relatively uninteresting, the pace at which the film goes also suffers during its duration, as it drags mainly in the middle, where little happens and the disinterest begins to be felt by the cinema.\r\n\r\nI must add that never in cinema did I visualize such a pretentious ending, without any kind of nexus or logic and that invalidates the entire trip that had been completed throughout the film. It was not a deserved ending, it was just an attempt to give rise to the ambiguity felt in the original, it was an ending indicator that my time had been wasted watching this film, which is nothing more than a confusing narrative.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, The Turning is a film that just isn't worth it, and if it weren't for the fact that it had a beautiful cinematography, a well-built atmosphere, some decent interpretations and a clear effort behind the making, it would really be worthy of a star."], [], ["**An apology to the fans of the first film, which is still not very convincing.**\r\n\r\nSometimes, even the most innocent and naive movie lover can understand that a movie is going to be a huge failure. That must have happened with \u201cHighlander II\u201d, since it is almost certainly one of the worst sequels ever made. After deciding to make this film, the producers and director Andrew Morahan were aware of this, and they corrected it by deciding to pretend that this film never existed, returning to the original and building on that foundation. The result wasn't a success, but at least it wasn't an insult either.\r\n\r\nThe script for this film shows us what happened after Connor MacLeod left Scotland, still wounded by the death of his first wife. He goes to Japan, where he seeks out a wise sorcerer named Nakano. It turns out that there was another immortal warrior interested in going against Nakano, to kill him and absorb his magic and power: Kane. The fight ends in the sorcerer's death. In the present day, his cave is discovered, along with bones and remains that point to the Scotsman's presence, which intrigues archaeologists and historians, as Connor, now a respectable antiquary, prepares for the ultimate battle with Kane.\r\n\r\nAll right, the script is really a mess and admits very silly possibilities for the eyes of anyone who understands and studies history. However, it is a much more decent script and much more in keeping with the original film, which can be said to be a positive point. Nevertheless, it doesn't bring anything really new or fresh, except for a few scenes that are set in the Baroque period and Revolutionary France. Even the villain is, at heart, a retelling of the villain from the first film.\r\n\r\nThe cast does what they can, but only Christopher Lambert deserves to be given the thumbs up for a satisfying job. There are a lot of clich\u00e9 situations or scenes where we get the feeling that the characters are not acting intelligently. Mako tries to be very genuine and gives his character a certain authenticity, which was positive, but everything else is forgettable. Mario Van Peebles seems to bet everything he can on his voice, the huskiest and most cavernous he can get, and Deborah Unger is just the pretty face of the moment.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film also sought to recreate the look of the first film. There are some points to highlight, namely the good work of the cinematography and the visual and sound effects, which manage to give the film some of the spectacular effects of the first one, without the freshness and authenticity. I also liked the period scenes in general. While not brilliant, they were a welcome addition that shows us a little bit of the main character's backstory. The soundtrack again bets on heavy rock, but is generally forgettable."], [], [], ["Stitching that burning ring of fire.\r\n\r\nSuture is written and directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel.

Yet what is most striking about the film's heart and soul is that it embraces a number of staple film noir narrative threads. Photographed in spanking monochrome, and featuring an unnerving musical score, this surreal like play works with a cheeky glint in its eye as it challenges the viewer's perception of the unfurling story.\r\n\r\nWrapped around a suggested agony of identity, Suture revels in films and styles of film making it is influenced by. Name checking them all is folly, but as the amnesia angle blends with surgical reconstruction, and the murder plot betrayal sidles up to the voiceover, other potent pics spring instantly to mind. And yet in a piece heavy on identity, Suture, in spite of its reliance on influences, does have its own identity, very much so.\r\n\r\nIt's quite a debut from McGehee and Siegel, one that begs the question of why they didn't go on to greater things? Here they have great camera craft, with close ups, overheads and frame blends in action, while there's some striking imagery and noirville shadow play to take in as mood setting accompaniments.

Needless to say, this isn't news that the authorities wish to be conveyed to the wider world, and so his exploration becomes steadily more perilous. Fortunately, he has a degree of diplomatic status and he does try to be fair with his reporting. On the face of it, the plan had merits - greater space to exploit, centralised harvesting, centralised everything, basically. What went wrong? Well, those aspects of \"Holodomor\" as it became known aren't really explained so well here, so at times the lack of recorded fact leaves the historical elements frustratingly scantily dealt with. Still, the dramatic ones work well with Peter Sarsgaard on good form as is Vanessa Kirby and the clearly rather more objective approach to this tragedy taken by director Angieszka Holland presents us with the template of a catastrophe and let's us reach some conclusions about complicity of and/or the domination of a doctrine for ourselves rather potently. The effects and results are there, but the causes - well maybe that's not so straightforward than propagandists on either side might prefer us to think.

Cue much malarkey as humans and cat try to solve the crime whilst staying one step/paw ahead of the criminals...\r\n\r\nUtterly harmless fluff from the House of the Mouse, That Darn Cat! is basically a live action cartoon. Away from the wonderful cat(s) performance - and the skillful capturing of said cat(s) reactions to situations - there's no great technical genius here.

He is a man with a strong will, and believes that he can change Maggie and give her the life that she deserves.

He doesn't want to sugarcoat anything, he just wants us to realize that these people are real, that they are our neighbours and friends, the people we pass on the street, see in the supermarket. He also wants to show us how wrong the system is (I think), and how little they care for the parents and, ultimately, the children. I mean, sure, if the kids were actually beaten or abused, they would need to be removed right away, but in this movie, there is no evidence to suggest that.

To categorize it, one might say it\u2019s an espionage thriller. But really, that covers merely the basics of what the film is all about. It\u2019s got suspense, adventure, romance, humor, heroics, and a cast that couldn\u2019t be improved upon if you tried!\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Hitchcock\u2019s first American picture was the well-done, if somewhat plodding, Gothic thriller Rebecca. While Rebecca is still an excellent film in its own right, boasting the talents of Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, and others, it isn\u2019t nearly as exciting or action-packed. Foreign Correspondent is the more important of Hitchcock\u2019s films, made at the start of WWII, and a clear call for American entry into the war at that time. Rebecca may have won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1940, but Foreign Correspondent was the more deserving film.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 1939, and Europe is on the brink of war. An American reporter named Johnny Jones is sent to England as foreign correspondent for the New York paper he works for. He takes on the pseudonym Huntley Haverstock and is soon investigating the ostensible assassination of an important diplomat, uncovering a Nazi spy ring in the process.\r\n\r\nHeading the cast are Joel McCrea and Laraine Day, two fine actors who are highly underrated today. The two of them maintain a good chemistry as the film progresses, and the supporting players are equally accomplished. George Sanders, that \u201cdreadful man,\u201d plays a wisecracking freelancer named Scott ffolliott, and gives a remarkable performance. Robert Benchley, as McCrea\u2019s fellow foreign correspondent Stebbins, co-wrote the script, and is said to have written much of his own dialogue. There\u2019s also Edmund Gwenn, cast against type as an affable Cockney hit man, and he makes the most of his short, but nonetheless important, role.\r\n\r\nAnd, in his second film with Hitchcock, we have Herbert Marshall, in a truly great performance. I\u2019ll have to leave it at that \u2014 because given half a chance, I could rattle on about the dear old chap for hours.\r\n\r\nThere are so many superbly crafted sequences in the movie, but I\u2019ll mention just a few here. There\u2019s the \u201cumbrella scene,\u201d where McCrea chases an assassin through a crowd of bystanders, getting lost amid the dozens of umbrellas. The windmill sequence, in which McCrea and his sidekicks find themselves alone in an open field, windmills softly turning with the breeze \u2026 or against the breeze, in the case of one such suspicious grinding mill, is marvelously shot. To add to the sense of urgency and danger, a single plane flies overhead. When McCrea sends Day and Sanders to fetch the police and enters the windmill himself, it\u2019s one of the tensest parts of the film. Thirdly, when two men masquerading as police officers arrive at McCrea\u2019s hotel room with malicious intent, he cleverly outwits them and escapes through the window, finding himself balanced precariously on a ledge far above the streets of London below \u2026 and dressed in his bathrobe. He proceeds to accidentally short circuit two of the letters in the hotel\u2019s neon sign, reducing HOTEL EUROPE to HOT EUROPE, with a flourish that is purely Hitchcockian.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also one brief but precious scene which for the most part probably goes unnoticed by audiences. During the car chase where McCrea meets Sanders, the assassin\u2019s car rips around a corner, almost hitting a poor old man trying to cross the street. He steps back onto the curb just in time, and as he tries to cross again, our heroes go flying by, narrowly missing the man as well. As he tries to cross for a third time, a whole squad of policemen on motorcycles tear down the street, and the man, thwarted yet again, escapes back to the safety of the curb, turns around, and goes back inside his house. To the average viewer, it\u2019s just one fleeting moment in the midst of an exciting, high-speed chase, but to be frank, the sequence had me in stitches; a glorious example of comic relief.\r\n\r\nAfter a rollicking adventure across the continent of Europe, approaching two full delightful hours for the viewer, Foreign Correspondent reaches its climax in the form of a plane crash into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean \u2026 and one of the principal characters gives his life in a touching show of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nSo do yourself a favor, if, like me, you are a lover of great cinema, and enter this Hitchcockian world.

While waiting they meet a British couple going on the same ship, Edward Underdown and Jennifer Jones (who play Harry and Gwendolyn Chelm). \r\n\r\nThe plot is an afterthought though. The film is about eccentric behavior. Philip Morley's character Peterson is a nervous, greedy, bumbling fellow. The two wives develop crushes on each other's husbands. Jennifer Jones as Gwen Chelm is a flighty, happy, imaginative creature of fancy who falls in love with Bogart. \r\nThe sea captain is a drunkard, and the ship is a rust bucket with a failing oil pump. The steward tells the passengers to return to the lounge. \"We're heading to the nearest port, and there seems to be some chance of our making it\" he says smiling. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy relaxed, amusing entertainment, you might like the witty company of this cast of seasoned actors and beautiful actresses."], [], ["There is something oddly static about this self adaptation of P.G.

Aided and abetted by George Burns, his press man (\"George\") and Gracie Allen (\"Gracie\"), his secretary - who offer an efficient if not terrific foil for the slightly obvious gags - he persists in pursuing his love. The dancing, almost all of which is performed en seul by Astaire - illustrates well his skill and the quality of the Gershwin's score, but somehow his solo performances just don't really engage. It's not just that there isn't a Ginger Rogers, it's that there is anyone at all. The briefest of scenes with Fontaine offer a taste of what we might have had (granted, she is not so adept as his more famous partner), but instead this is essentially a solo effort that, for me, demonstrated certain limitations with Astaire's acting prowess. It's an enjoyable film to watch, and there's no denying \"Put Me to the Test\" and \"Nice Work if You Can Get It\" get toes a-tapping, but the dance ensembles scenes are more reminiscent of a choir practice, and the whole thing just lacks pizzazz..."], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["Good movie!", "Thank you very much for not splitting this movie into two parts.

Jonathan Taylor Thomas, meanwhile, plays Tom and he is, probably, the best part of this production. He's cheekiness works well for the role. Elsewhere, Eric Schweig (Injun Joe) makes for a decent bad guy.\r\n\r\nI like the vibe of <em>'Tom and Huck'</em>, I think it could've done without the love story but that doesn't hamper things much. I would say the film goes at a slower pace than I would prefer, it particularly drags ever so slightly towards the end.

Yes, I have never read Twain's books, even though they are available in good translations into my mother tongue. I never felt the desire or curiosity. This film takes advantage of two of its most important characters: Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, two boys full of personality. However, it's the only thing it takes advantage of, creating an entirely new story for them.\r\n\r\nIt may not seem like it, but it is a film with Disney's approval. It is a film aimed at a teenage audience, with some maturity, and therefore has some violence and already addresses normal themes among teenagers, such as dating. The story created for the film is good enough for the effect it is, and for the film in question, but it is clear that the studio did not waste a lot of time or spend a lot of money on this production. On a technical level, the film meets the minimum requirements, but does not deliver anything beyond that.\r\n\r\nOverall, the film is good enough to entertain us, but it is unlikely to leave a lasting memory in anyone's mind. It is absolutely forgettable, so much so that, nowadays, no one remembers it. Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Brad Renfro are the duo of young actors who lead the cast, and they are really the only ones to deserve a certain type of prominence for the work they have developed.

When the man seems to die in an accident he is resuscitated by a revolutionary doctor (Alfred Molina). Yet coming back from the afterlife has a peculiar effect as he starts to have visions of a local serial killer (Jeremy Sisto).\r\n\r\n\"Hideaway\" (1995) is a psychological crime thriller with mystery/horror elements based on Dean R. Koontz\u2019 1992 novel. Dean hated the end results and wanted his name removed from the credits, but the gist of his story is intact (I guess the devil is in the details, as they say).  True, the movie changes Regina from a cool orphan into a typical spoiled teenager and omits elaboration on how Vassago (Sisto) becomes what he is, but so what? You can only fit so much of a book into 1 hour and 45 minutes; besides, enough detail is there if you read in between the lines.\r\n\r\nThe movie reminds me of a meshing of the future \u201cKiss the Girls\u201d (1997) and \u201cBless the Child\u201d (2000). It shares the tone and general locations of \u201cDisturbing Behavior\u201d (1998) with the story being influenced by flicks like \u201cBody Parts\u201d (1991) and \u201cEyes of Laura Mars\u201d (1978). Obviously if you favor these kinds of flicks you\u2019ll probably like this one despite complaints by Koontz and fans of the book.\r\n\r\nThe storytelling is a little confusing in certain ways (for instance, if the killer dies in the opening sequence, how can he be alive & murdering people?). Yet everything is explained by the last act. Meanwhile the colorful CGI depicting the afterlife is quaint (being done in 1994) and reminiscent of the dubious effects in \u201cBless the Child,\u201d but that\u2019s okay because the afterlife should appear amorphous anyway.\r\n\r\nSilverstone was about 18 during shooting and quite fetching, but she\u2019s not the focus; Goldblum and Sisto are. Speaking of Sisto, he looks & acts like Jim Morrison would if he was a psycho serial murderer. Meanwhile Lahti was 44 at the time and looks great.\r\n\r\nThe ending at the titular hideaway (in a defunct amusement park) is thoroughly comic booky, but the flick has effective atmosphere and delivers the goods if you can roll with it rather than against it.    \r\n\r\nThe film was shot in Britannia Beach, British Columbia, which is 20 miles north of Vancouver.

Haas is his best friend, the new guy working the street. His father is a doctor, but kicked him out for being gay. Most of the film concerns John's efforts to collect money he owes a drug dealer. His shoes are stolen in the opening moments of the film, and we find out that was where he stashed his cash. This opening also sets up a failed surprise ending that is really forced. The film's sparse plot meanders through John's encounters, some with other men named John, hence the film's title, until the end. Haas and Arquette are ready to leave for Branson, Missouri on a bus but Arquette wants to do \"one last date.\" You can probably see where that is going.\r\n\r\nThe film has enough quirky characters to make a \"Northern Exposure\" fan drool.

Elliott Gould plays a rich client of Arquette's. Arquette's drug dealing nemesis cannot add and subtract. All of these actors have little quirks and tics that I think the film maker wanted us to find endearing. You only have sympathy for Haas, so I felt the film wasted too much time showing us all the other scenes. Arquette is five years too old for this role, and except for Haas, everyone goes through the motions of a story that liberally borrows from \"Midnight Cowboy.\" The film wants to make a moral point, but try to have fun doing it at the same time, and this does not work. Silver's direction is better than his script, and you have to give him credit for coming up with one of the most eclectic soundtracks I have ever heard, but eventually \"Johns\" fails both Haas, and us.

That being said, this film is terrible. Burton spent so much effort and time worrying about making this film Gothic and off pace, stuffing his favorite actors into the film even though half of their parts were pointless, he forgot he was making a film.

He\u2019s obviously a fish-out-of-water in 1972, but acclimates pretty quickly. Eva Green is perfect as the ee-vil witch and Carter is enjoyable as usual. I don\u2019t get the hubbub over Moretz, but she\u2019s a\u2019right (and holds a surprise for the last act). Alice Cooper is featured in a glorified cameo.

Fuller headed for Brazil to make a preliminary study and settled in a village of the indigenous Karaja tribe. He scouted locations, shot some footage of local nature and customs, and discovered some elements that he might work into the screenplay. In the end, however, the whole project came to naught when insurance companies refused to provide coverage for a shoot in what was then a remote and potentially dangerous part of the world.\r\n\r\nIn Mika Kaurism\u00e4ki's 1992 documentary, TIGRERO: A Film that was Never Made, Sam Fuller returns to the same village he based himself in four decades before. American indie filmmaker Jim Jarmusch tags along as the interlocutor to which Fuller recounts the whole Hollywood story and comments on how rural Brazil has changed since his first visit. Jarmusch is also interested in the culture of the Karaja, taking photographs of the village (some of which are included as extras in the DVD release) and narrating in voiceover some of their traditions and practices. The downside of this is that the duo talk about the Karaja according to the noble savage stereotype, depicting them as an idyllic people without a care in the world, and the film never confronts the challenges they might have faced now as modernity arrives, or forty years ago when life was no bed of roses either.\r\n\r\nThe film has an inauspicious beginning, where Jarmusch asks Fuller in Rio de Janeiro why he's there, and it's obvious that this whole (very stilted) dialogue is scripted. Once they subsequently reach the Karaja village, their chats seem more real. The first thing they do in the village is project the footage that Fuller he had shot forty years before to the locals. The Karaja are amazed to see their long-dead relatives and friends. As one Karaja explains the visceral impact that this film footage had on him, Fuller tells him \u201cThat\u2019s called emotion,\u201d the same cinematic creed he professed in his cameo role in Godard's Pierrot Le Fou.\r\n\r\nFuller is a funny character. He was already around 80, a wizened old man that seems only about half the height of Jarmusch, but he\u2019s full of energy and enthusiasm for this adventure. He appears almost invariably with a cigar in his mouth and a baseball cap and talks in this really old-timey New York Jewish accent. I honestly found him hard to understand at points, it's like watching someone speaking Elizabethan English step out into the world of 1992.\r\n\r\nTIGRERO doesn't seem a major achievement in documentary filmmaking, and after one viewing I don't feel in a hurry to ever see it again.

The Invitation takes the successes of Ready or Not and blends them with the Dracula story putting a fresh new take on a familiar story. The film benefits from this new approach and introduces new characters and ideas. But that is where the good runs out. The first hour of the runtime forces a romance between the heroine and a painfully suspicious and uncomfortable forward rich guy. Unfortunately, the story gets so caught up in trying to fool the audience into thinking it is a simple romance movie, so it could shock with the vampire twist that it didn't leave time to make the conclusion feel rewarding or earned. Once the monsters finally revealed themselves, The Invitation sprinted to the end, with the inexperienced heroine easily besting Dracula and his minions; corrupt families and monsters had survived and thrived for hundreds of years. The victory sadly does not convince or satisfy. If The Invitation had spent less time on the failed love story and more time developing the vampire story, this could have been a good movie.", "_The Invitation_ started off so well, but eventually morphed into a generic film that I could have predicted from a mile away. The set up to the movie was decent, but the second act was when I really thought this movie nailed it. I really enjoyed the somewhat sadistic back and forth between the two leads. On one hand, you see a woman ready to give herself over to the thought of love for the first time. While on the other hand, the audience knows this chance at love is built on a lie. Despite this fact, I found the chemistry incredibly strong between the two leads. I was smiling as their love story progressed, even though I knew it was not going to end well. Nathalie Emmanuel and Thomas Doherty do such an excellent job in this film. I loved their chemistry and Dohery does such a great Jekyll and Hyde with the unearthly vampire masked by the charismatic lord. Super entertaining watching them do great work here.\r\n\r\nThe creepy disturbing nature of the trailers was not overly present here, almost all of the unsettling imagery was used for the trailers and leaves the rest of the movie feeling pretty generic. This is even more evident when the movie turns into a vampire action flick reminiscent of the Twilight movies. At this moment, I was completely ripped out of the movie and was ready for it to end. This drastic change in tone really did not fit well here for me.

After this Sterling Hayden starrer he signed off from Hollywood for good, as a legacy it's difficult to say if it's a fitting point of reference to Lewis and his talents, or entirely apt for his career? It's an often quirky, even bizarre, picture that manages through its surreal like tendencies to detract from its formulaic Western plot. \r\n\r\nSet in Prairie City, Texas, the tale revolves around George Hanson (Hayden), a Swedish whaler who after 19 years away, returns to Prairie to find his father has been murdered. As he delves deeper with a staunch undaunted determination, he finds that the law is corrupt and a horrible land baron called McNeil (Sebastian Cabot), aided by gunslinger for hire Johnny Crale (Ned Young), is behind his fathers death. It appears there is oil in the land and McNeil is using force to buy up the land at ridiculously cheap prices. But if he thought George was going to be forgiving? Or going to be easily frightened? Well he and Crale are in for some big shocks. \r\n\r\nShot in stark black and white, Lewis' film throws up the always interesting conflict between homespun virtue and greedy evil. There's compelling villains and some nicely drawn characterisations for the decent citizens of the town, such as those who are on the periphery of the protagonists struggle (note Victor Millan's poor Mexican farmer and Carol Kelly's downbeat girlfriend of Crale). \r\n\r\nWhat of Hayden, though? It's a fascinating performance, where saddled with the task of trying to do a Swedish accent, and wearing a suit a size too short for him, it's difficult to know if he is in tune with the off-kilter nature of the film, or he's just on robotic auto-pilot while Lewis chuckles to himself off camera. Either way Hayden gives us a character to root for with our every breath. Hanson is a bastion of good and well meaning, we ache for him to outdo the lobster eating land baron and the metal clawed outlaw. \r\n\r\nThere's some controversy in the tid-bids here. The script was credited to Ben Perry, but actually was written by Dalton Trumbo who was blacklisted. Hayden, although not blacklisted, appeared before the House of Un-American Activities Committee and simultaneously admitted past communist affiliations and named names. Lewis was not involved in the unsavoury chapter but was a close friend of Ned Young, who was blacklisted for taking the fifth, but whose impact on the film was to not only be in it, but to also be instrumental in getting Lewis to direct it.

No matter how many lives are lost over the years, there will always be another group of adventurers ready to take on the mountain and the elements that come with her.\r\n\r\nThe ill fated 1996 trek up Everest gets a worthy cinematic treatment here. Sure it suffers from some of the pitfalls of the disaster movie genre, such as weak characterisations and fake sequences, but emotional investment is high and ready to be grasped by those so inclined. The drama on the mountain is gripping, and thankfully this is matched by the frantic concurrent story strands involving the family and friends waiting at base camp and the family homes. Cinematography is often breathtaking, the acting performances as solid as one of Everest' rock faces, but it's the story that sells itself. A tale well worth reading about, and the cynical among us should do well to remember this fact. 8/10", "> One of the most realistically approached adventure movie based on the real.\r\n\r\nI was completely surprised with the movie. Because I was expecting 'Vertical Limit' kind of movie. Like, you know, there's no heroic adventure with the incredible stunt sequences in it. But it was very real and more real. Usually while adapting the true events for the screen, unnecessary overdose stunts created to commercialise the product. But in this it was too much closer to the real world adventure, like a documentary film.\r\n\r\nIt was a man versus the mother nature and nothing else. The human villains were not included or the romance and other subplots. It was a multi starrer movie. Lots of big names played only a small role and magnified the expectation for the movie. But like I said expecting awesomeness will lead you to a great disappointment. One must approach this movie with a clear mind for a good result, because I felt the film very honest, and being honest is always a bit boring.\r\n\r\nThe film was emotionally very strong. No character developments, not individually, but the entire film was focused on one particular expedition taken by a couple of trekking teams that goes wrong after they got hit by a storm. This is Jason Clarke's one of the best films in a lead role, as well as for the director of 'Contraband'. I definitely regret missing it out in digital 3D. It is a good watch, absolutely refreshing from the mainstream commercial films.\r\n\r\n7/10", "I have read dozens of books about mountaineering expeditions, and several about this particular disastrous climbing season, including Jon Krakuer\u2019s bestseller. Overall I think they did a good job depicting the events in this movie, which makes sense, as they used the expertise of Guy Cotter, a climbing and business partner of Rob Hall, one of the expedition leaders in the forefront of this tragedy.\r\n\r\nThey do an adequate job of putting the grandeur of the mountain on display, while still focusing on the human interactions and personal physical challenges of the characters. The plot runs fairly true to events and the dialogue is well-written. They made changes, of course, such as details of the helicopter rescue scene, but stayed true to the important stuff.\r\n\r\nI think I agree with the above-mentioned Guy Cotter, who stated in an interview that he only wished they had depicted in more depth the motivations of climbers to risk their lives climbing up in the \u201cDeath Zone.\u201d For some climbers of Everest, their reasons are mundane: to be able to gain respect by saying they did it, or to \u201cinspire\u201d others to be all they can be, or even to make money and win some measure of fame. \r\n\r\nBut the true mountaineers are driven by  something deeper, close to what they see as their self identity.  They can\u2019t not climb. There is exhilaration in challenging their physical limits and in appreciation of the rare beauty found at high altitudes. If it was easy they might not do so much of it, being in an odd way addicted to the pain, cold and danger. WHen they are on the mountains they dream of home; when they are home they dream of the mountains. It\u2019s reminds me of aging boxing champions who keep on fighting when they should retire. Oh, they want the money, obviously, but even well-off champions may fight on and endure pain and suffering inside the ring for the cheers of the crowd and the additional acclaim it may bring them.", "Based on true events, this rather beautifully shot film tells the story of Kiwi Rob Hall (an adequate Jason Clarke) who ran an exclusive adventure agency that took well-heeled climbers up Mount Everest. In 1996 he decided to team up with accomplished but rather enigmatic mountaineer Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal). What now ensues are a rather join-the-dot series of predicable escapades as the mountain decides that it's had enough of these messy and polluting human gadflies on it's slopes, and so it fights back - impressively and decisively. That leads us to the problem with this - the characterisations are seriously undercooked. I didn't really feel that I knew any of them, nor did I actually find - especially with Gyllenhaal - that I cared whether they survived or not. That might be a testament to their acting skills - some creating an aura of complacency and arrogance that well deserved their just desserts, but for the most part the script and the story were just all a bit flat. The cinematography is astonishing though, with actuality of the Nepalese base camps and of the rather benign looking mountain itself. It features quite a notable supporting cast, but again they offer little to beef up the sense of personality here or give us any real sense of the danger, teamwork and camaraderie that must have prevailed in real life. It is watchable for the imagery, and it also serves to remind up that mankind is pretty insignificant when the planet decides to stir itself against us, but as a piece of drama it's all just too lacklustre."], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], ["Lone bandit evades police clutches.\r\n\r\nThis is a true story...\r\n\r\nIt's known to the Police Department of one of our largest cities as the most difficult homicide case in its experience. Principally because of the diabolical cleverness, intelligence and cunning of a completely unknown killer.....The record is set down here factually-as it happened. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.\r\n\r\nCracking little noir picture this one. Richard Baseheart is Davis Morgan, a cold and calculated thief and murderer. He is not only unknown to the police, but also to the Los Angeles underworld. Something which made him a terrifying ghost on the streets. Based on the real life case of cop-killer come thief Erwin Walker, who in 1946 struck terror into the heart of LA, He Walked By Night zips along at a frenetic pace but maintains all the darkness requisites of the Film Noir genre. Directed by Alfred Walker (aided by one uncredited Anthony Mann) and also starring Jack Webb (who used the piece as inspiration for the popular \"Dragnet\" TV series), the picture has excellent use of shadows and a brilliant finale down in the Los Angeles drainage system. Where the sound of guns and running feet is just ferocious. \r\n\r\nBaseheart is suitably chilling as a man coming unhinged by the day, whilst a home surgery sequence shows Baseheart to have had no small amount of ability. It's notable with Morgan's character that it's people he just doesn't like, there's a very telling scene with his dog that is sweet but at the same time saying so much about the man himself. This film reminded me very much of Edward Dmytryk's similarly fine 1952 film, The Sniper. So much so I'd say that as a double bill they be perfect for each other. With added plot worth in the form of early police forensics (check out the photo fit technique) and a largely unknown support cast adding a raw reality to proceedings, He Walked By Night comes highly recommended to fans of the Noir and Crime genres. 8/10", "This is actually quite a decent little murder mystery featuring the usually pretty uncharismatic Richard Basehart as a petty thief who kills a cop. The police chief allocates two detectives - Scott Brady and James Cardwell - with the seemingly impossible task of tracking down the criminal for a crime that nobody saw/heard etc... They start off by trawling the usual suspects and gradually begin to piece it together and to see the light. It's tensely directed with lots of help from Leonid Raab's score; some suitably eerie lighting and Crane Wilbur's adaptation of his own story is a bit more complex giving the investigator's characters a little more substance than usual.

Initially all goes well, they all bond nicely and he settles in as one of the family.

The daughter, Joyce (Laura Sadler), meantime, is fully aware of her mother's peccadilloes and threatening to tell her father, insists that she becomes part of their games. Not the sex part, no, but she essentially treats him like an indulgent new father - and one with whom she becomes increasingly infatuated. Needless to say, this situation cannot continue but it's only when he tries to end things that he discovers that his older paramour is quite prepared to make his life a criminal misery with some heinous allegations should he try to escape this web of deceit - before a picnic brings things to a tragic and definitive head! Walters and Graves are both fine here, but they don't gel especially well together and that's quite crucial to the addictive nature of this story. The sex scenes are almost comedic at times and the ease with which this menage-\u00e0-trois seems to thrive rather robs the film of much of a sense of jeopardy, or even that they might be doing something wrong and immoral.

Not only has New York changed for the worse, being run by incompetent pretenders to his crown, but the police force are also after his head - dead or alive!\r\n\r\nFirst time viewers to this picture should not go into it expecting some Scarface type gangster movie, I made that mistake almost 17 years ago and came out the cinema totally cheesed off! Revisiting the film now has opened up a whole new ream of delights that when put together have created a simmering and brutal piece of work. What director Abel Ferrara has managed to do here is portray a fable of how a leopard never changes its spots - even though it wants too. Frank White is here a victim of his own past doings, with his reputation on the wane and the authorities with long and unforgiving memories.\r\n\r\nWhat hits the most (outside of some brilliant acting) is Abel Ferrara's bleak yet gorgeous vision of a sin city Big Apple, the characters are all one step away from a death, something that we the audience hope comes swift and nasty, all of which is cloaked in this plink plink lighted vision of the underworld. Ferrara chooses to pace his picture to give us a sense of pervading doom, it's quite a knack and means the viewers have to hang on in there to get to the wonderful, and dare I say it, bleakly appropriate conclusion.\r\n\r\nChristopher Walken is Frank White and gives one of his best career performances, all scary eyes and dialogue spurting precision, he pours out grit and emotion to garner sympathy where he perhaps really shouldn't be getting it. Larry Fishburne, David Caruso, Victor Argo, Wesley Snipes, Janet Julian and Steve Buscemi fill out the cast list, with Fishburne and his manic Jimmy Jump character practically walking off with the movie. So all in all it's a visual delight and a story that is very good on the ears, with the violence perfectly harsh to flesh out the grim nature of this pot boiling crime picture.\r\n\r\nSo, those in need of a pick me up should probably steer well clear then. 8/10", "Incredibly acted and beautifully stylized.

One night event. The whole film was shot within the three weeks. Minimised dialogues, maximised actions. This film has such a good record those.

Particularly, for a thriller like this, they usually scare the viewers with sudden and loud sounds. This film had those, but minimised. You can't blame for isolated settings too, because such crimes can be easily committed on those backdrops. It's all about Kate Siegel. Her best film, according to me. Nice direction, from one of the latest horror flick maker. But this is not a horror film. It is a terror, a thriller.

It's ominous and foreboding, setting the tone for what is to follow. Pic is deliberately paced, beautifully so, with the opening nonlinear approach and scattergun shifts in time adding a sort of psychological maelstrom to the impending narrative darkness.\r\n\r\nYet to suggest it as a perpetually bleak picture is doing it a small disservice, for Kitano (himself working from a damaged psyche that occurred in real life) has this adroit eye for poetic beauty and human tenderness that marries up with bursts of violence and emotionally shattering passages of play. And it works brilliantly, with stabs of humour also filtering in via the outer frames. \r\n\r\nNishi the character is a force of nature and a walking - brooding - contradiction, a man pained behind his sunglasses, his expressionless visage amazingly still saying so much. When he explodes the impact is doubly strong, mainly because dialogue is so sparse, but the interwoven visuals - very much a Kitano speciality - strike an almighty chord for the story. To which we edge towards the finale, which unsurprisingly brings beauty and infinite sadness.\r\n\r\nUnfussy camera work, sabre sharp editing (Kitano & Yoshinori Oota), elegiacal musical arrangements, art, kites and Kitano's intense performance, this rounds out as film making greatness.

It illustrates the vulnerability of even the most robust of human beings when touched by tragedy and despair - and when that person is a cunning and capable killer, these risks for all become ever more exacerbated. There's not a great deal of dialogue here, it's mostly Kitano reacting to and dealing with the scenarios he faces trying to sustain that sense of stability and to deal with his crescendo of guilt and it's quite enthralling at times to watch.

Hathaway works from a screenplay collectively written by Charles Brackett, Walter Reisch and Richard L. Breen. It stars Joseph Cotton, Marilyn Monroe, Jean Peters, Max Showalter (as Casey Adams), Denis O'Dea and Richard Allan. Music is by Sol Kaplan and cinematography by Joseph MacDonald.\r\n\r\nPlot wise it's very simple, the core essence that of an unfaithful wife scheming against her husband - thus garnering peril ire from the jealously unstable man -  but simplicity of plot does not stop this from reaching craftily high peaks. Hathaway and MacDonald breathtakingly weave the splendid location into the unfolding story, something that simultaneously brings out the sensual beauty of the two lovely leading ladies, with the sense of danger still always as a constant factor. The framing of man made structures such as staircases and the bell tower are readily given a noir vibe, again enhancing a story pungent with human fallibilities and dripping wet metaphors.\r\n\r\nNow that the film is readily available in restored home formats, one gets to see the sublime work of MacDonald. The Technicolour photography has a lurid broody sheen to it, thus enhancing the disquiet mood pulsing away in the story and that of Monroe's sensuality within it. Peters (a true classic beauty), in what is the toughest part, doesn't let her character become secondary to Monroe's (even more impressive given Monroe's fine work and Hathaway's lingering usage of her), so much so that when the edge of the seat finale arrives we the audience are fully immersed in it. While Cotten as the tortured husband to Monroe's adulterous wife nails the duality of the character for maximum returns.\r\n\r\nNature's ferocious marvel and the raw power of sex and its destructive powers comes crashing together in this early 50s Hitchcockian like diamond. 8/10"], [], [], ["This film captures you from start to finish, like the music!

It's a little too contrived for its own good, with the odd character serving to the plot as god knows what? Seriously, what is Baker doing here? While the weak ending doesn't pay off on the suspense and mystery that had previously been well orchestrated by Dmytryk. On the plus side is the shadowy black and white photography by MacDonald, giving the film an edge, and the use of real New York locations lend the film some serio worth.\r\n\r\nMatthau slips in and steals the film from an efficient Peck, and Kennedy and McCarthy score well as muscle and shifty respectively.
