If the State Department determined Israel had broken humanitarian law, then it would have been even harder to justify continued U.S. military assistance to Israel.

NYU Nurse Is Fired After Calling the Gaza War a ‘Genocide’ in Speech,1047,1716999404.0,90,0.98,1d3g34f,InternationalNews,"###NYU Langone Health gave the nurse, Hesen Jabr, an award for her work. She said hospital officials then fired her because she made pro-Palestinian remarks in an acceptance speech.

Earlier this month, NYU Langone Health bestowed an award on a labor and delivery nurse for providing compassionate care to mothers who had lost babies. But shortly after, the nurse said, the hospital fired her over the speech she gave when she accepted the award. 

In her speech, [according to a video she posted on social media](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7dEqylofUU/), Ms. Jabr drew a connection between her work with grieving mothers in New York and the war in Gaza.

“It pains me to see the women from my country going through unimaginable losses themselves during the current genocide in Gaza,” said Ms. Jabr, who is Palestinian-American. “This award is deeply personal to me for those reasons.”

She added, “Even though I can’t hold their hands and comfort them as they grieve their unborn children and the children they have lost during this genocide, I hope to keep making them proud as I keep representing them here at NYU.”

US House passes controversial bill that expands definition of anti-Semitism,923,1714614746.0,253,0.96,1ci3sav,InternationalNews,"May 1 2024

The United States House of Representatives has overwhelmingly passed a bill that would expand the federal definition of anti-Semitism, despite opposition from civil liberties groups.

The bill passed the House on Wednesday by a margin of 320 to 91, and it is largely seen as a reaction to the ongoing antiwar protests unfolding on US university campuses. It now goes to the Senate for consideration.

If the bill were to become law, it would codify a definition of anti-Semitism created by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

That is a federal anti-discrimination law that bars discrimination based on shared ancestry, ethnic characteristics or national origin. Adding IHRA’s definition to the law would allow the federal Department of Education to restrict funding and other resources to campuses perceived as tolerating anti-Semitism.

What is the definition?
IHRA’s working definition of anti-Semitism is “a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities”.

According to the IHRA, that definition also encompasses the “targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity”.

The group also includes certain examples in its definition to illustrate anti-Semitism. Saying, for instance, that “the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor” would be deemed anti-Semitic under its terms. The definition also bars any comparison between “contemporary Israeli policy” and “that of the Nazis”.

However, IHRA does specify that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as anti-Semitic”.

Is the Amazon Rainforest still on fire?,15,1588774371.0,2,0.9,gekr84,GlobalClimateChange,"In the midst of the pandemic, I suddenly felt the urge to look for any updates on the fires happening in the Amazon but to my dismay, I only found articles from 2019. I can’t seem to find any coverage on this anywhere.

Of course, maybe it’s the pandemic but I’m just worried if it’s actually the suppression of media coverage similar to August 2019. But here’s what I could find:

During the Amazon Country Summit on August 28, 2019, it was announced that the countries sharing the Amazon rainforest, excluding Venezuela, will hold a summit in Colombia on September 6, 2019, to discuss the ongoing Amazon fire situation. Which led to the involved countries signing a pact to coordinate monitoring of the Amazon forest and disaster response, and a better information network to coordinate their responses.

(Paraphrased &amp; summarised from the [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Amazon_rainforest_wildfires))

However, no further news other than when Brazilian President, Jail Bolsonaro [scaled back on efforts to fight illegal logging, mining and farming,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/americas/brazil-amazon-deforestation.html) which have led to widespread destruction of the Amazon Rainforest (again)

I Googled “Amazon Wildfire 2020” and set the search settings to show me articles from this year and only found 6 of them.

•[(1)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.mongabay.com/2020/02/upset-about-amazon-fires-last-year-focus-on-deforestation-this-year-commentary/amp/) •[(2)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/01/10/world/amazon-rainforest-wildfires-climate-change-study/index.html) •[(3)](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/jessica-carey-webb/amazon-still-fire) •[(4)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1ZE2HL) •[(5)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/news/world/1224783/amazon-rainforest-fire-latest-news-has-the-amazon-rainforest-fire-stopped/amp) •[(6)](https://news.gsu.edu/2020/02/20/forest-fire-an-update-on-the-amazon-wildfires/)

I know we’re in a pandemic right now with this outbreak getting worse but I’m concerned for the lack of media coverage on this topic especially considering how President Jair Bolsonaro backed out from his conservation efforts and went ahead with continuing the deforestation of the Amazon.

Thanks for reading all.

Both agencies put 2019 in second place below 2016, when a strong El Niño took place.

In early 2015, NASA posted [this](https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2224/) article about the ten hottest years on record at the time, and briefly reviewed a world event from that year. The purpose of this is to get people to see the hottest years not just as numbers but to associate them with events. This helps people understand just how recent these years are- anyone out of high school can easily remember them.

I want to do the same thing now, so here are the ten hottest years on record according to an average of NASA and NOAA data, with an event associated. I'm pretty sure the original NASA article only used its own data and it's been updated, so some years on that page may be flipped around here. The events for 2010, 2009, and 2005 were taken directly from that page. (And I've also posted this on a few other forums.)

&#x200B;

**1. 2016 - Louisiana flooding**

 In August of the hottest year ever recorded, catastrophic floods devastated southern Louisiana and submerged thousands of buildings. Governor Edwards declared a state of emergency and called the flooding historic and unprecedented. Many scientists believe climate change will make these events in Louisiana more common in the future. 

**2. 2019 - Australian bush fires**

 In late 2019, the 2019-20 bush fire season began in Australia, and it is the worst bush fire season in Australia since at least 1974. 2019 was also the hottest and driest year on record in Australia, and there is a drying trend in Australia around the regions of the bush fires. Dryer and hotter conditions are more favorable for bush fires, and climate change will likely make these events more common in the future. 

**3. 2017 - Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria**

 2017 had an extremely active and dangerous hurricane season in the Atlantic. Harvey was the costliest hurricane on record and produced catastrophic floods in Texas. Irma caused a lot of destruction in the Caribbean as well as Maria, which left parts of Puerto Rico without electricity for months. It is currently unclear if climate change is changing, or will change, hurricane frequencies or intensities. 

**3. 2015 - Paris Climate Conference**

 In December 2015, 196 countries from around the world met in Paris to set a plan to keep global temperatures below the famous 2C limit relative to pre-industrial temperatures. An agreement was made and ratified, but there are no enforcement mechanisms, and a few world leaders of carbon-intensive countries since then have said they want to exit the agreement. 

**5. 2018 - Eruption of Anak Krakatoa volcano**

 The Anak Krakatoa volcano between the Java and Sumatra islands in Indonesia erupted on 22 December 2018 which then triggered a deadly tsunami, killing about 400 people and injuring 14,000 others. It is so far the deadliest volcano eruption of the 21st century. 

**6. 2014 - Ebola outbreak**

 In 2014, there was an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Liberia which spread to neighboring countries, and the World Health Organization declared an emergency on 8 August. The outbreak lasted until mid-2016 and infected roughly 30,000 people, of which about 40% died. 

**7. 2010 - BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico**

 The Gulf of Mexico oil spill began on April 20, 2010. It lasted 87 days and spewed about 260 million gallons of crude oil into the ocean, making it the worst marine oil spill in history. Eleven people and countless marine animals were killed. 

**8. 2013 - Snowden leaks of Global Surveillance**

 In June 2013, CIA employee Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified documents from the NSA, revealing extensive global surveillance of hundreds of millions of people, looking through things such as phone calls and internet history. To avoid prosecution by the U.S. government for leaking classified information, Snowden fled to Russia, where he resides today. 

**8. 2005 - Hurricane Katrina**

 Hurricane Katrina formed in the Bahamas on August 23, 2005 and made landfall on August 29, causing flooding and severe destruction along the Gulf Coast. New Orleans, Louisiana, was especially hit hard when levee failure caused over 80 percent of the city to become inundated. 

**10. 2009 - Copenhagen Climate Conference** 

 The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference was held in Copenhagen December 7-18, 2009.

First off,  I am not  sure many Americans would be too concerned with.  Especially if this is  50+ years away.  That is not a judgement of Americans, but there are so  many challenges right now that are arguably larger in size that they  can directly map themselves to.

Second, I really feel this  article is counterproductive on some level.  After all, we were just  told two weeks ago that we only have 12 years to save humanity.  With  some articles literally calling for the end of humanity by 2050.  So,  how do these numbers track to those, and if they don't why are we  surprised when those we are trying to engage are less than engaging.

Given  this is our daily truth, and we are trying to engage as many people as  possible, I'd really enjoy hearing from the group about how and what we  need to do better if our goal really is to better engage and catalyze  change.",True

The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats. 

This is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s administration.

The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from cancer.
Architect of the legal fight for women’s rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation’s highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.

Megathread: Federal Judge Rules President Trump Must Turn Over Eight Years Of Personal And Corporate Tax Returns,73111,1570454872.0,14357,0.89,dejfnt,politics,"A federal judge on Monday rejected a bold argument from President Trump that sitting presidents are immune from criminal investigations, allowing the Manhattan district attorney’s office to subpoena eight years of the president’s personal and corporate tax returns.

Lawyers for Mr. Trump were expected to appeal the ruling from Judge Victor Marrero of Manhattan federal court. The president’s could not immediately be reached for comment.

In a 75-page ruling, Judge Marrero said called president’s argument ""repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values."" Presidents, their families and businesses are not above the law, the judge ruled.

In response, the President's lawyers filed an emergency notice of appeal to the 2nd circuit. 


## UPDATE:

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has granted Donald Trump a temporary administrative stay pending expedited review by a panel of the Court.

"Susan Collins has failed the people of Maine and this country. She has voted to confirm Trump’s judicial nominees, approve tax cuts for the rich, and has repeatedly chosen to put party before people. I am running to send her packing. I’m Betsy Sweet, and I am running for U.S. Senate in Maine. AMA.",71854,1577979683.0,2378,0.81,eizr6l,politics,"Thank you so much for your thoughtful questions! As usual, I would always rather stay and spend my time connecting with you here, however, my campaign manager is telling me it's time to do other things. Please check out my website and social media pages, I look forward to talking with you there!

I am a life-long activist, political organizer, small business owner and mother living in Hallowell, Maine. I am a progressive Democrat running for U.S. Senate, seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Susan Collins. 

Mainers and all Americans deserve leaders who will put people before party and profit. I am not taking a dime of corporate or dark money during this campaign. I will be beholden to you. 

I support a Green New Deal, Medicare for All and eliminating student debt. 

As the granddaughter of a lobsterman, the daughter of a middle school math teacher and a foodservice manager, and a single mom of three, I know the challenges of working-class Mainers firsthand.

I also have more professional experience than any other candidate in this Democratic primary. 

I helped create the first Clean Elections System in the country right here in Maine because I saw the corrupting influence of money in politics and policymaking and decided to do something about it. I ran as a Clean Elections candidate for governor in 2018 -- the only Democratic candidate in the race to do so. I have pledged to refuse all corporate PAC and dirty money in this race, and I fuel my campaign with small-dollar donations and a growing grassroots network of everyday Mainers. 

My nearly 40 years of advocacy accomplishments include:

* Writing and helping pass the first Family Medical Leave Act in the country

* Creating the first Clean Elections system in the country

* Working on every Maine State Budget for 37 years

* Serving as executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby

* Serving as program coordinator for the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom

* Serving as Commissioner for Women under Governors Brennan and McKernan

* Co-founding the Maine Center for Economic Policy and the Dirigo Alliance
Founding and running my own small advocacy business, Moose Ridge Associates.

* Co-founding the Civil Rights Team Project, an anti-bullying program currently taught in 400 schools across the state. 

* I am also a trainer of sexual harassment prevention for businesses, agencies and schools. 

I am proud to have the endorsements of Justice Democrats, Brand New Congress, Democracy For America, Progressive Democrats for America, Women for Justice - Northeast, Blue America and Forward Thinking Democracy.

Megathread: FBI Searches Former President Donald Trump's Florida Home,70155,1660003796.0,24912,0.89,wjoj1w,politics,"Former President Donald J. Trump said on Monday that the F.B.I. had searched his Palm Beach, Fla., home and had broken open a safe — an account that, if accurate, would be a dramatic escalation in the various investigations into the former president. The search, according to two people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, after he left the White House. Those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents. The discovery of classified information at Mar-a-Lago was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it had found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

Megathread: President Donald Trump Removes Watchdog Overseeing Rollout of $2 Trillion Coronavirus Bill,69255,1586282034.0,8437,0.9,fwp42m,politics,"President Trump on Monday replaced the Pentagon's acting Inspector General Glenn Fine, who had been selected to chair the panel overseeing the rollout of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed last month, Politico first reported.

 A group of independent federal watchdogs selected Fine to lead the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, but Fine's removal from his Pentagon job prevents him from being able to serve in that position — since the law only allows sitting inspectors general to fill the role.

The court in a brief order rejected a request made by U.S. Congressman Mike Kelly, a Trump ally, and other Pennsylvania Republicans who filed a lawsuit after the Nov. 3 election arguing that the state’s 2019 expansion of mail-in voting was illegal under state law.

A senior Democratic aide said the likely plan is for the House to return on Saturday.

In a letter to lawmakers, Pelosi said the House would vote on legislation to prohibit the Postal Service from implementing any changes to services it had in place on Jan. 1, 2020. Democrats have accused President Donald Trump of trying to hamstring the cash-strapped Postal Service to suppress mail-in voting.

Megathread: President Trump Suggests Delaying 2020 Presidential Election,65982,1596115768.0,17328,0.89,i0m1wk,politics,"President Trump on Thursday suggested delaying November’s presidential election.

The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20 inauguration.

Any such move would require a change of federal law, meaning it would need to go through Democrats in the House of Representatives in addition to the Republican-controlled Senate. (The Congressional Research Service actually weighed in on this topic in March, specifically noting that a president has no legal authority to change the date of the election.)

OMB told GAO that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent ""in a manner that could conflict with the President’s foreign policy."" The law does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons.

Cancer all clear inspires woman to retrain as nurse,364,1717336366.0,4,0.97,1d6dsk3,UpliftingNews,"Article:

Care from hospital staff inspired a business woman to retrain as a nurse five days after she got the all clear from cancer
.
Eve Howard, from Penkridge, Staffordshire, was diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer in October 2018.

The mum-of-two had three surgeries, including having part of her bowel removed, before she was given the all clear on 12 January 2021.

Inspired by the staff at Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital she applied to become a nurse on 17 January and is now two months away from qualifying.

Ms Howard said: “I feel a 100% different person to who I was before my cancer – it’s very transformative.”

The 46-year-old joked that this was despite the fact her tummy “now looks like Google Maps”.

Before her diagnosis and treatment, Ms Howard ran an IT and marketing firm, with Virgin among her clients.

She was diagnosed when an 8cm (3.1in)-long tumour was found in her bowel along with two tumours in her liver.

She had surgery in August 2019 to remove 20cm (7.1in) of her bowel and had a stoma fitted.
Ms Howard then had liver surgery in November 2019 at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital before a stoma bag reversal at New Cross in 2020.

She said her experience of the care she received during her treatment inspired her to retrain.

“Honestly, from that moment forward, I couldn’t think of another career that I wanted to do,” she added.

Ms Howard is now applying for permanent roles at The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust and is determined to work at New Cross.

As well as it being where she had the majority of her treatment, it was also where her late dad was treated for prostate cancer and where her children were born.

Moose the black labrador eats cowboy boot,0,1717129635.0,6,0.09,1d4n6iq,UpliftingNews,"From the article:

Tamworth-based vet Ciara Richardson discovered her furry friend had taken a liking to her housemate's cowboy boots last weekend.

""We went outside and found that the boot had been redesigned by Moose; we quickly figured that she'd eaten it all,"" she said. 

Luckily for four-year-old Moose, Dr Richardson knew what changes to look for and stayed calm and kept a close eye on her health.

""It went pretty downhill a few days after she ate the boot; she stopped eating, started vomiting and was quite flat.

""That's when she took the trip into work with me and we found it all in her belly.

""With labradors, they'll eat anything. Moose has been quite the victim historically, she eats anything ... everything is deemed edible with that dog.""

Dr Richardson said the surgery was successful, although the boot could not be saved. 

""The leather was in there for quite awhile and you could definitely tell that from the smell,"" she said.

""There was a fair few spots along her intestines where the leather was stuck, so I ended up making one incision into her stomach and one further down her guts.

""Of course it had long strings attached from the embroidery of the boot as well so I had to fish those out.""

Dr Richardson said Moose was making a full recovery.

""We laughed about it, it was a pretty interesting redesign of my housemate Ruby's boot,"" she said.

""She tried to wear it and it was an interesting fashion statement.""

Gaza war: Jabalia residents describe 'horrifying' destruction,79,1717457225.0,1,0.99,1d7iswj,InternationalNews,"Palestinians who have returned to Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza in recent days have expressed shock at the level of destruction following a three-week Israeli military operation there against Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups.

“Even the sand beneath our feet is scorched; it's unbearable to walk on,” he told BBC Arabic. “The streets are strewn with rubble and demolished buildings. Words fail to describe the devastation.”

The man - who asked not to be named - also said he had seen injured and dead people “lying on the ground” and that essential services and goods were not available.

“There is no electricity or water. There are no clinics or medicines,” he added. “Wells have been destroyed, shops and supermarkets demolished, and there is a shortage of food.”

The town of Jabalia and its decades-old urban refugee camp - the largest in Gaza, with more than 110,000 registered residents - witnessed weeks of devastating bombardment and fighting after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October. 

On 12 May, the IDF said troops were going back into Jabalia for an operation ""based on intelligence information regarding attempts by Hamas to reassemble its terrorist infrastructure and operatives in the area"". Over the next three weeks, battles raged as tanks and troops advanced into the refugee camp under the cover of intense air and artillery strikes.

A spokesman for Gaza said on Friday that its rescue teams had found dozens of bodies across Jabalia camp mostly women and children - including 30 members of one family.

On Sunday, the director of a hospital in the neighbouring town of Beit Lahia said 120 bodies had been recovered from Jabalia and the surrounding area, and that many more were believed to be buried under rubble.

The head of the municipal emergency committee declared Jabalia town, Jabalia camp, Beit Lahia and nearby Beit Hanoun as “disaster zones” estimating that 50,000 housing units had been destroyed.

Unrwa, meanwhile said it had received “horrific reports” from Jabalia camp. They included displaced people, including children, reportedly being killed and injured while sheltering in an Unrwa-run school that was besieged by Israeli tanks. There were also reports of Unrwa offices being destroyed by air strikes and bulldozed by Israeli forces.

One of the returnees said that he and his seven-year-old son had seen “the bodies of martyrs scattered everywhere in the streets”.

“East Jabalia has been subjected to an unprecedented devastation. There is no doubt that the goal of the occupation [Israel] in displacing people and destroying their homes and shops is to force them to leave this country”",False

The Israeli army says it investigates itself. Where do those investigations stand?,106,1717344993.0,7,0.97,1d6gv4y,InternationalNews,"Throughout its grinding seven-month war against Hamas, Israel has pledged to investigate a series of deadly events in which its military forces are suspected of wrongdoing. The commitment comes in the face of mounting claims — from [human rights groups](https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-airstrike-hamas-war-palestinians-344bd8da0254e83eedd7245a593823d0) and the [International Criminal Court ‘s](https://apnews.com/article/icc-israel-hamas-gaza-warrants-court-c0509ed7daf21f9cc78ec17b8e627327) chief prosecutor — that the country’s leaders are committing war crimes in Hamas-ruled Gaza.

In one of the highest-profile cases, an attack on a World Central Kitchen convoy that [killed five foreign aid workers](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-aid-workers-killed-2d08786a9839dfc402632c7ca745acca), the Israeli army promptly published its findings, acknowledged misconduct by its forces and [dismissed two soldiers](https://apnews.com/article/israel-world-central-kitchen-gaza-aid-workers-69b6176362dafc8e4e2754b2342faa1d). But other investigations remain open, and admissions of guilt are rare.

Israel’s Military Advocate General, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said this week that the military is investigating about 70 cases of alleged wrongdoing. She gave few details. The military refused to disclose the full list of investigations and told The Associated Press it could only respond to queries about specific probes.

A look at some of the investigations that have been publicly announced:

* **This Tuesday - A [deadly strike](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-05-28-2024-21ea44e3b514d3f3f2bd26a33f157e48) on a tent camp sheltering displaced families in the southern Gaza city of Rafah which killed at least 45 people and caused widespread destruction:** The military’s chief spokesman said the Israeli munitions used that day in efforts to eliminate two Hamas militants were too small to be the source of a fire that broke out.

* **February - Israeli troops [fired on a crowd](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-02-29-2024-f9b5a62a80d8b83eac4946d3c85af58b) of Palestinians waiting for aid in Gaza City. At least 104 people were killed and 760 were wounded:** Army officials initially said it was stampede of huge crowds trying to grab supplies but later they changed their story. The investigation found that troops opened fire at some who approached them and posed a threat to them and that a tank also fired warning shots to disperse “suspects.” 

* **October - [An explosion](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hospital-explosion-3d255725997c4e2757372b3ee2fc8859) in the courtyard of the Al-Ahli hospital set off an inferno that burned men, women and children alive:** An [AP investigation](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-hospital-rocket-gaza-e0fa550faa4678f024797b72132452e3), along with U.S. and French intelligence assessments, concluded a misfired rocket likely caused the explosion.

* **January - Palestinian man [was fatally shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ey0Lf7Fb2A&list=PLnwt1fUa-EVhHEHY16Za6nORjkefQpR8_&index=15) while walking with four others:** The army said it conducted an in-depth investigation and found the tank did not fire at the men.

* **March 22 - Bombing of five Palestinians near Khan Younis:** Four men walking along a dirt road before a strike hits them, killing all four instantly. Another man tries to run away before he is hit and killed. The military said the investigation had been turned over to the independent fact-finding group.

* **April - Gaza surgeon Adnan al-Bursh died in an Israeli prison after he was rounded up in an arrest raid on Al Awda hospital:** Those who saw Bursh in detention reported that he looked depleted and bore signs of violence. Israeli police will conduct an autopsy of Bursh’s body. It’s unclear when the autopsy will be conducted.",False

Israel maintains a shadowy hospital in the desert for Gaza detainees. Critics allege mistreatment,58,1717300178.0,1,0.95,1d64l4x,InternationalNews,"Patients lying shackled and blindfolded on more than a dozen beds inside a white tent in the desert. Surgeries performed without adequate painkillers. Doctors who remain anonymous. 

These are some of the conditions at Israel’s only hospital dedicated to treating Palestinians detained by the military in the Gaza Strip, three people who have worked there told The Associated Press, confirming similar accounts from human rights groups.

While Israel says it detains only suspected militants, many patients have turned out to be non-combatants taken during raids, held without trial and eventually returned to war-torn Gaza.

Eight months into the Israel-Hamas war, accusations of inhumane treatment at the Sde Teiman military field hospital are on the rise, and the Israeli government is under growing pressure to shut it down. Rights groups and other critics say what began as a temporary place to hold and treat militants after Oct. 7 has morphed into a harsh detention center with too little accountability.

Israel has detained some 4,000 Palestinians since Oct. 7, according to official figures, though roughly 1,500 were released after the military determined they were not affiliated with Hamas. Israeli human rights groups say the majority of detainees have at some point passed through Sde Teiman, the country’s largest detention center. 

A soldier who worked at the hospital recounted an elderly man who underwent surgery on his leg without pain medication. “He was screaming and shaking,” said the soldier.

Between medical treatments, the soldier said patients were housed in the detention center, where they were exposed to squalid conditions and their wounds often developed infections. There was a separate area where older people slept on thin mattresses under floodlights, and a putrid smell hung in the air, he said.

Most patients are diapered and not allowed to use the bathroom, shackled around their arms and legs and blindfolded. “Their eyes are covered all the time. I don’t know what the security reason for this is,”",False

"Israel could have used smaller weapons against Hamas to avoid deaths in Gaza tent fire, experts say",52,1717124129.0,5,0.93,1d4ljvb,InternationalNews,"Defense experts who have reviewed debris images from [an Israeli airstrike that ignited a deadly fire in a camp](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-05-26-2024-eb25eb70d2c7b9e6bcd0497060eccbca) for displaced Palestinians questioned why Israel did not use smaller, more precise weapons when so many civilians were nearby. They said the bombs used were likely U.S.-made.

The strikes, targeting Hamas operatives, killed as many as 45 people sheltering in a temporary displacement camp near the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Sunday and have [drawn international condemnation.](https://apnews.com/article/biden-rafah-israel-gaza-hamas-20ab56f356e75273b24ad6361a6a0e0d)

Israel is investigating the attack but says the Hamas targets were 1.7 kilometers (1 mile) away from a declared humanitarian zone and that its review before the strike determined no expected harm to civilians.

But displaced civilians were scattered throughout the area, and Israel had not ordered evacuations. So even if the tents that burned were not inside the marked humanitarian zone, the civilians there thought it was safe.

Even the smallest jet-launched munition may be too big when civilians are near because of how they explode and can send fragments far, defense experts said.

Images posted on social media from the tent camp on Monday and verified by The Associated Press showed a CAGE code, a unique identifier assigned to U.S. government suppliers, on pieces of the exploded weapons.

Based on those images and satellite photos of the debris field, two defense experts said the bombs used were likely U.S.-made 250-pound (113-kilogram) GBU-39 small-diameter bombs.

Though they’re smaller than many other weapons the U.S. has provided to Israel, these bombs can still create a wide swath of damage. The entire 250-pound shell and components are designed to spew fragments that can travel as far as 2,000 feet (600 meters).

“You essentially have two bombs they use that the fragments can travel 600 meters in a densely packed area. So that just doesn’t check out if they’re trying to limit casualties,” said Trevor Ball, a former Army explosive ordnance demolition technician.

The debris field in Gaza is indicative of the bombs possibly being set to detonate before impact, which would ensure their intended targets were killed but also risk unintended deaths, Ball and Cancian said.",False

What the I.C.J. Ruling Actually Means for Israel’s Offensive in Rafah • There is a substantial consensus among legal experts that Israel cannot continue its current Rafah offensive without violating the court’s order.,35,1717077763.0,5,1.0,1d44sk3,InternationalNews,"[The court’s ruling](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/24/us/israelruling.html) was unusually forceful: the judge said Israel “must halt” its military offensive in Rafah “immediately.” Many observers had not expected the court to issue such a direct order because it has no jurisdiction to impose similar requirements on Hamas, Israel’s opponent in the war.

The court’s use of punctuation was definitely going to provoke debate:

> The State of Israel shall, in conformity with its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and in view of the worsening conditions of life faced by civilians in the Rafah Governorate:

> Immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.

For several days some legal scholars have been arguing about whether the clause that begins “which may inflict” might put conditions on the order to “immediately halt.”

There is a substantial consensus among legal experts that Israel cannot continue its current offensive in Rafah without violating the court’s order. Five leading legal scholars I contacted said the order was clear on that point, and more said [the same](https://x.com/letter_of_mark/status/1794011854659821780) in [interviews](https://x.com/DAWNmenaorg/status/1794141109196575057) and [social media](https://twitter.com/Heidi__Matthews/status/1794059869164597366) [posts](https://twitter.com/kevinjonheller/status/1794087611264356473) online.

An earlier paragraph of the order offered vital context, these experts pointed out, and clearly explained the urgency of the court’s intervention:

> “On the basis of the information before it, the Court is not convinced that the evacuation efforts and related measures that Israel affirms to have undertaken to enhance the security of civilians in the Gaza Strip, and in particular those recently displaced from the Rafah Governorate, are sufficient to alleviate the immense risk to which the Palestinian population is exposed as a result of the military offensive in Rafah.”

NYU Nurse Is Fired After Calling the Gaza War a ‘Genocide’ in Speech,1050,1716999404.0,90,0.98,1d3g34f,InternationalNews,"###NYU Langone Health gave the nurse, Hesen Jabr, an award for her work. She said hospital officials then fired her because she made pro-Palestinian remarks in an acceptance speech.

Earlier this month, NYU Langone Health bestowed an award on a labor and delivery nurse for providing compassionate care to mothers who had lost babies. But shortly after, the nurse said, the hospital fired her over the speech she gave when she accepted the award. 

In her speech, [according to a video she posted on social media](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7dEqylofUU/), Ms. Jabr drew a connection between her work with grieving mothers in New York and the war in Gaza.

“It pains me to see the women from my country going through unimaginable losses themselves during the current genocide in Gaza,” said Ms. Jabr, who is Palestinian-American. “This award is deeply personal to me for those reasons.”

She added, “Even though I can’t hold their hands and comfort them as they grieve their unborn children and the children they have lost during this genocide, I hope to keep making them proud as I keep representing them here at NYU.”

"Access to Aid in Gaza Was Dire. Now, It’s Worse.",42,1716856275.0,1,1.0,1d26pgh,InternationalNews,"###The flow of aid into Gaza has shrunk so much in May that humanitarian officials say their operations are at risk of shutting down, and that the [threat of widespread starvation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/world/middleeast/rafah-gaza-aid-hunger.html) is more acute than ever.

The entry of aid trucks through Gaza’s southern crossings, where most aid has arrived since the war began, has nearly ground to a halt since Israel expanded its fighting in the southern city of Rafah. In northern Gaza, new entry points have enabled small amounts of critical aid to reach those who have been most at risk of famine for months. But that aid is insufficient to support the Gazan population, and most cannot reach the central and southern areas, where a majority of people are newly displaced by the war.

Israel’s strict controls on aid and the challenge of distributing it within the enclave had already created [catastrophic levels of hunger.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/world/middleeast/gaza-famine-report-starvation.html)

In early May, Israel expanded its military operation in southern Gaza after a Hamas rocket attack killed four soldiers near a crossing at Kerem Shalom. Israel closed that crossing as well as the Rafah crossing, where a majority of aid had been coming in. [Nearly 300 aid trucks had crossed there](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTVkYmEwNmMtZWYxNy00ODhlLWI2ZjctNjIzMzQ5OGQxNzY5IiwidCI6IjI2MmY2YTQxLTIwZTktNDE0MC04ZDNlLWZkZjVlZWNiNDE1NyIsImMiOjl9&pageName=ReportSection3306863add46319dc574) in a single day just before the incursion.

Israel reopened Kerem Shalom on May 8, but aid workers from multiple organizations have said the vital entry point remains functionally closed, with a daily average of just eight aid trucks entering. 

The crossing area is still an active military zone and that safety and logistical challenges can hold up aid that arrives at the crossing and prevent it from being immediately collected and distributed.

Before the Rafah operation, most people were sheltering in the areas where a majority of the aid was coming in. But now, new entry points in the north — the U.S. pier, and a new crossing called [Erez West](https://twitter.com/cogatonline/status/1789686967589843327) — are [beset with problems](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/politics/pentagon-gaza-pier-aid.html). They bring in too little aid to sustain everyone and are located far from the largest clusters of people.

UNRWA announced on May 21 that it had [suspended distribution in Rafah](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/politics/pentagon-gaza-pier-aid.html#:~:text=The%20U.N.%20agency%20for%20Palestinian,and%20Kerem%20Shalom%20border%20crossings.), citing security issues, supply shortages and an inability to access its warehouse.

For instance, on May 18, the World Food Program reported that [11 of 16 trucks were looted](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/20/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas-rafah?smid=url-share#one-of-the-first-aid-shipments-to-arrive-at-a-us-built-pier-was-looted) after leaving the U.S. pier.

"EU foreign chief says Israel must respect UN court, control settler violence in the West Bank",101,1716779890.0,4,0.99,1d1i7jf,InternationalNews,"The European Union’s foreign policy chief insisted Sunday that Israel must abide by the U.N. top court’s rulings and end its offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah and, at the same time, questioned the possible involvement of authorities in the settler violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.

On a day that visiting Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa basked in the attention after two EU nations and Norway pledged to recognize a Palestinian state, Josep Borrell further pressured Israel to take immediate actions to make sure that tax income meant for the Palestinian authorities is no longer stopped.

The demands came at the end of the week that saw the international community put increasing pressure on Israel to fundamentally change the course of the war it wages on Hamas in the Gaza Strip through international court action and diplomatic maneuvering.

Borrell insisted Israel had driven the Palestinians to the edge of a catastrophe because “the situation in Gaza is beyond words. The occupied West Bank is on the brink, risking an explosion any time.” 

While most of the global attention is centered on Gaza, Borrell said that “we should not forget what’s happening in the West Bank,” where the seat of the Palestinian Authority is based.

“There we see an intensified spiral of violence. Indiscriminate and punishing attacks by extremist settlers, more and more targeting humanitarian aid heading to Gaza. And they are heavily armed. And the question is, who is arming them? And who is not preventing this attack from happening,” Borrell said. ",False

Visual analysis: the growth of Gaza’s wartime trash mountains • Heaps of waste become vast symbol of breakdown of governance in strip,48,1716741774.0,1,0.93,1d15ffy,InternationalNews,"As Israel’s war with militant group Hamas ravages the besieged Gaza strip, many basic services have collapsed. Trash collection is among them, meaning that as Gazans have fled Israeli bombings from one part of the strip to another, growing mountains of waste have followed.

The heaps have grown so large that their vast, chaotic shapes are visible in satellite images taken from hundreds of kilometres above the Earth.

Before the war began in October, Gaza’s sewage processing and trash collection were already severely hampered by the Israeli blockade that started in 2007 after Hamas took control of the enclave. Trash pick-ups were haphazard: some rubbish was collected by employees paid by Hamas’s West Bank rival, the Palestinian Authority, while others worked for international aid groups.

Nearly all of that dysfunctional tapestry of services has been disrupted by the war, leaving waste as an unavoidable visual symbol of how completely the conflict has devastated even the meagre infrastructure that existed in Gaza.

More than 140 solid waste dump sites are sprawled across the narrow 41km-long Gaza Strip, according to satellite analysis of Planet Labs imagery by the Financial Times, Dutch NGO PAX and Marilena Zigka of Princeton University.

Since the latest incursion began, some collection has taken place: earlier this year about 10,000 tonnes of waste was collected from around Rafah and Khan Younis, in an initiative carried out by the UN supporting a local organisation. But this is a tiny fraction of what is needed.

UNRWA said Israel continues to deny its garbage collection services access to landfills in Israel. The Israeli military directed queries on the subject to COGAT, an arm of the ministry of defence responsible for civilian issues in occupied Palestinian territories, which did not respond.

Skin infections, Hepatitis A and diarrhoea, all especially devastating for the young, are on the increase. A Johns Hopkins study earlier this year warned that if these diseases turned into an epidemic, as many as 11,000 Palestinians could die of easily preventable infectious diseases before the peak of summer.

Gazans, often including children, who pick through garbage for useful, edible or saleable items, face particular health risks, including from medical waste that is often mixed in with general rubbish, said Zwijnenburg.

Soil and water are also becoming contaminated.

####Israeli activists battle over Gaza-bound aid convoys

Months after some Israelis started to protest against aid lorries entering Gaza at the main Kerem Shalom crossing, the battle has moved to other key junctions, where rival groups of activists do their best to block or protect aid convoys.

In recent weeks, social media has been flooded with images of aid lorries being blocked and ransacked.

Right-wing activists, including Jewish settlers living in the occupied West Bank, have uploaded dozens of videos of crowds, including some very young children, hurling food onto the ground and stamping on boxes of aid.

Many argue that Gazans should receive nothing while Israeli hostages remain in captivity, and that providing aid to Gaza merely serves to prolong the war.

In one video, a group of jubilant protesters dance and celebrate on top of a looted lorry.

In another, one of the stranded lorries is ablaze.

Other videos show Israeli vigilantes stopping lorries in Jerusalem and demanding that drivers show papers proving they are not transporting aid to Gaza. Their faces are uncovered and they appear to be acting with complete impunity.

In the West Bank, at least two drivers who were not carrying goods bound for Gaza were dragged from their cabs and beaten.

Egypt said the two sides agreed to transfer aid trucks and fuel through Kerem Shalom ""temporarily"" until an agreement to reopen the Rafah crossing is reached.

"How does this end? With Hamas holding firm and fighting back in Gaza, Israel faces only bad options",44,1716487848.0,7,0.88,1cyzhgd,InternationalNews,"Diminished but not deterred, Hamas is still putting up a fight after seven brutal months of war with Israel, regrouping in some of the hardest-hit areas in northern Gaza and resuming rocket attacks into nearby Israeli communities.

Israel initially made tactical advances against Hamas after a devastating aerial bombardment paved the way for its ground troops. But those early gains have given way to a grinding struggle against an adaptable insurgency — and a growing feeling among many Israelis that their military faces only bad options, drawing comparisons with U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Here’s a look at four ways this war might end.

* FULL-SCALE MILITARY OCCUPATION: After dismantling Hamas. Israel would need to remain in control to prevent Hamas from regrouping. Far-right members of Netanyahu’s governing coalition have called for permanent occupation, “voluntary emigration” of large numbers of Palestinians to anywhere that will have them, and rebuilding of Jewish settlements in Gaza.
* A LIGHTER OCCUPATION, AIDED BY ‘UNICORNS’: Israel will maintain security control over Gaza but delegate civilian administration to local Palestinians unaffiliated with Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. Arab and other countries assist with governance and rebuilding. But so far, none have shown interest.
* A GRAND BARGAIN: Arab states have coalesced around a U.S. proposal under which a reformed Palestinian Authority would govern Gaza with the assistance of Arab and Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia, which would normalize relations with Israel in return for a U.S. defense pact and help in building a civilian nuclear program. But U.S. and Saudi officials say that hinges on Israel committing to a credible path to eventual Palestinian statehood. Israel has ruled it out.
* A DEAL WITH HAMAS: Hamas has proposed a very different grand bargain — one that, ironically enough, might be more palatable to Israelis. A phased agreement in which it would release all of the hostages in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners — including senior militants — as well as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, a lengthy cease-fire and reconstruction.",False

Donald Trump foreign policy advisers met Israeli PM Netanyahu,29,1716238076.0,8,0.89,1cwq0gh,InternationalNews,"Three former U.S. foreign policy officials in Donald Trump's administration met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other public figures in Israel on Monday, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

The delegation was comprised of Robert O'Brien, who served as Trump's fourth and final national security adviser, as well as former Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates John Rakolta and former Ambassador to Switzerland Ed McMullen, said the person, who requested anonymity as the trip's itinerary was not public.

Among the main goals of the trip was to obtain a better understanding of Israel's complex domestic political situation, said the person familiar with the visit. 

Trump has occasionally criticized Israel over its operation in Gaza, and he has faulted Netanyahu for failing to prevent the Oct. 7 attack. But Trump, the Republican candidate for president, consistently portrays himself as a more reliable ally to Israel than Democratic President Joe Biden, his rival in the Nov. 5 election.

During Trump's 2017-2021 White House term, the U.S. moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a long-held conservative goal that delighted Israelis and infuriated Palestinians.

Rakolta, the former ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, played a major role in the Abraham Accords, agreements signed during the Trump years, which normalized bilateral relations between Israel and both Bahrain and the UAE.

O'Brien has emerged as one of Trump's top foreign policy advisers, and he will likely play a significant role in a second Trump term should he return to office, according to several people with knowledge of their relationship.

The Biden administration, while initially steadfast in its support, has expressed misgivings with elements of Israel's war strategy in recent months. This month Biden paused shipments of thousands of bombs to Israel in response to Israel's decision to expand its assault on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza.

That pause prompted Trump to accuse Biden of abandoning an ally.",False

It will be present,” the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, Martin Griffiths, told AFP on the sidelines of meetings with Qatari officials in Doha.

“And I think our worry, as citizens of the international community, is that the consequence is going to be really, really hard. Hard, difficult, and apocalyptic.”

Griffith said 50 trucks of aid a day could reach the hardest-hit people north of Gaza through the reopened Erez crossing on the northern frontier. However, he added, the battles near the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings in Gaza’s south meant the vital routes were effectively blocked.

“So aid getting in through land routes to the south and for Rafah, and the people dislodged by Rafah is almost nil,” Griffiths added. “And we all said that very clearly, that a Rafah operation is a disaster in humanitarian terms, a disaster for the people already displaced to Rafah. This is now their fourth or fifth displacement,” he said.",False

Israel pushes further into parts of north Gaza; new cracks in Netanyahu coalition,35,1716132311.0,1,0.98,1cvqrnf,InternationalNews,"Israeli troops and tanks pushed on Saturday into parts of a congested northern Gaza Strip district that they had previously skirted in the more than seven-month-old war, killing and wounding dozens of Palestinians, medics and residents said.

Israel's forces also took over some ground in Rafah, a southern city by the Egyptian border that is packed with displaced people and where the launch this month of a long-threatened incursion to crush hold-outs of Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas has alarmed Cairo and Washington.

Israel has conducted renewed military sweeps this month of parts of northern Gaza where it had declared the end of major operations in January. At the time, it also predicted its forces would return to prevent a regrouping by the Palestinian Islamist group that rules Gaza.

Exposing further cracks in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, Benny Gantz, a centrist member of the war cabinet, threatened to resign if the right-wing leader does not agree by June 8 to a day-after plan that would include how Gaza might be ruled after the war with Hamas.

Gantz said his proposal would include creating a temporary U.S.-European-Arab-Palestinian system of civil administration for Gaza while Israel retains security control.

Though Gantz is Netanyahu's most formidable rival in opinion polls, were he to leave the government that would not be enough to bring about its collapse, as remaining parties would still give the premier a comfortable parliamentary majority.",False

Protesters Agreed to Leave. This Is What Some Colleges Promised in Return. • Several universities struck agreements with pro-Palestinian demonstrators to end disruptive encampments on their campuses. But some of those agreements are already under fire.,35,1716046676.0,1,0.97,1cv00h8,InternationalNews,"At the University of California, Berkeley, student activists got their president to agree to support a cease-fire in Gaza. At Rutgers University, they won a promise of scholarships for 10 Palestinian students displaced by the war. Brown University pledged that its board of trustees would vote on divesting from Israel.

As protests over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza have roiled college campuses across the country, dozens of universities have moved to shut down encampments and arrest demonstrators. But more than a dozen institutions have struck agreements with protesters over the past few weeks that effectively conceded to some of their demands.
None of them offer outright pledges to end the billions of dollars that college endowments have invested in companies that are said to support Israel’s occupation, a key demand of most of the protesters; some offer little more than amnesty for students suspended as a result of the protests or vague pledges to widen the curriculum in Palestinian studies.

But already, the agreements have come under criticism both from other student activists, who say that not enough concessions were extracted, and from conservatives and Jewish advocacy groups, who complain that they are rewarding students who disrupted campuses and violated university policies.

In 5 months, the subreddit went from a subscribership in mid-teens, with single digit upvotes and zero comments per submission, to a subreddit that regularly makes the top 10 of /r/All and occasionally top 3-5, outperforming subreddits with much larger number of subscribers.",156,1715817094.0,32,0.98,1cszh90,InternationalNews,"What a ride! 

The subreddit was abandoned for a while. When we came on board to revive the subreddit, it had some subscribers in the mid-teens, but from testing out new submissions, it seemed that we were pretty much starting from zero. 

Following the reddit guide for growth, it really seemed like for a while it was going nowhere. 

It was around when we were getting 4-6 comments per submission, that the subreddit was modestly self growing. Eventually it got to 20 comments per submission. 

Then one day in the mod mail we got an automated message from a reddit admin bot that they have noticed increased activity and gave me a list of suggestions for tools. I said 'huh?' and there was a few submissions with hundreds of comments. It's like it happened overnight. 

Eventually we got overwhelmed by the reports and weren't able to keep up. I found the needamod subreddit and started recruiting, the new people made this subreddit what it is today, implementing industrial strength tools and policies used by subreddits in the millions of subscribers. 

About a month ago I saw that we cracked the top 10 in /r/all. Now, it's not uncommon to see a submission make it that far, and occasionally we crack the top 3-5, outperforming subreddits with much larger subscriber bases. I think it's due to an engaged and interested subscriber base. 

Thanks to each and everyone who made this subreddit happen.

As it stands, politicians and financial institutions have the biggest leverage in deciding the fate of the climate, so working in solar panels wouldn't do much help for example. I am young, driven, and reasonably smart. I have family in the EU, UK, and USA, so I can move around. If you had to give me 20-year plan which would save the climate, what would you tell me to do? I'm thinking something Greta Thunberg or Boyan Slat, somebody needs to be the face of change and I will step up to it if no one else does.

I can’t seem to find any coverage on this anywhere.

Of course, maybe it’s the pandemic but I’m just worried if it’s actually the suppression of media coverage similar to August 2019. But here’s what I could find:

During the Amazon Country Summit on August 28, 2019, it was announced that the countries sharing the Amazon rainforest, excluding Venezuela, will hold a summit in Colombia on September 6, 2019, to discuss the ongoing Amazon fire situation. Which led to the involved countries signing a pact to coordinate monitoring of the Amazon forest and disaster response, and a better information network to coordinate their responses.

(Paraphrased &amp; summarised from the [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Amazon_rainforest_wildfires))

However, no further news other than when Brazilian President, Jail Bolsonaro [scaled back on efforts to fight illegal logging, mining and farming,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/americas/brazil-amazon-deforestation.html) which have led to widespread destruction of the Amazon Rainforest (again)

I Googled “Amazon Wildfire 2020” and set the search settings to show me articles from this year and only found 6 of them.

I know we’re in a pandemic right now with this outbreak getting worse but I’m concerned for the lack of media coverage on this topic especially considering how President Jair Bolsonaro backed out from his conservation efforts and went ahead with continuing the deforestation of the Amazon.

Both agencies put 2019 in second place below 2016, when a strong El Niño took place.

In early 2015, NASA posted [this](https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2224/) article about the ten hottest years on record at the time, and briefly reviewed a world event from that year. The purpose of this is to get people to see the hottest years not just as numbers but to associate them with events. This helps people understand just how recent these years are- anyone out of high school can easily remember them.

I want to do the same thing now, so here are the ten hottest years on record according to an average of NASA and NOAA data, with an event associated. I'm pretty sure the original NASA article only used its own data and it's been updated, so some years on that page may be flipped around here. The events for 2010, 2009, and 2005 were taken directly from that page. (And I've also posted this on a few other forums.)

&#x200B;

**1. 2016 - Louisiana flooding**

 In August of the hottest year ever recorded, catastrophic floods devastated southern Louisiana and submerged thousands of buildings. Governor Edwards declared a state of emergency and called the flooding historic and unprecedented. Many scientists believe climate change will make these events in Louisiana more common in the future. 

**2. 2019 - Australian bush fires**

 In late 2019, the 2019-20 bush fire season began in Australia, and it is the worst bush fire season in Australia since at least 1974. 2019 was also the hottest and driest year on record in Australia, and there is a drying trend in Australia around the regions of the bush fires. Dryer and hotter conditions are more favorable for bush fires, and climate change will likely make these events more common in the future. 

**3. 2017 - Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria**

 2017 had an extremely active and dangerous hurricane season in the Atlantic. Harvey was the costliest hurricane on record and produced catastrophic floods in Texas. Irma caused a lot of destruction in the Caribbean as well as Maria, which left parts of Puerto Rico without electricity for months. It is currently unclear if climate change is changing, or will change, hurricane frequencies or intensities. 

**3. 2015 - Paris Climate Conference**

 In December 2015, 196 countries from around the world met in Paris to set a plan to keep global temperatures below the famous 2C limit relative to pre-industrial temperatures. An agreement was made and ratified, but there are no enforcement mechanisms, and a few world leaders of carbon-intensive countries since then have said they want to exit the agreement. 

**5. 2018 - Eruption of Anak Krakatoa volcano**

 The Anak Krakatoa volcano between the Java and Sumatra islands in Indonesia erupted on 22 December 2018 which then triggered a deadly tsunami, killing about 400 people and injuring 14,000 others. It is so far the deadliest volcano eruption of the 21st century. 

**6. 2014 - Ebola outbreak**

 In 2014, there was an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Liberia which spread to neighboring countries, and the World Health Organization declared an emergency on 8 August. The outbreak lasted until mid-2016 and infected roughly 30,000 people, of which about 40% died. 

**7. 2010 - BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico**

 The Gulf of Mexico oil spill began on April 20, 2010. It lasted 87 days and spewed about 260 million gallons of crude oil into the ocean, making it the worst marine oil spill in history. Eleven people and countless marine animals were killed. 

**8. 2013 - Snowden leaks of Global Surveillance**

 In June 2013, CIA employee Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified documents from the NSA, revealing extensive global surveillance of hundreds of millions of people, looking through things such as phone calls and internet history. To avoid prosecution by the U.S. government for leaking classified information, Snowden fled to Russia, where he resides today. 

**8. 2005 - Hurricane Katrina**

 Hurricane Katrina formed in the Bahamas on August 23, 2005 and made landfall on August 29, causing flooding and severe destruction along the Gulf Coast. New Orleans, Louisiana, was especially hit hard when levee failure caused over 80 percent of the city to become inundated. 

**10. 2009 - Copenhagen Climate Conference** 

 The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference was held in Copenhagen December 7-18, 2009. The goal of the conference was to negotiate a deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and hold the temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius, but participating nations failed to reach an agreement.",True

First off,  I am not  sure many Americans would be too concerned with.  Especially if this is  50+ years away.  That is not a judgement of Americans, but there are so  many challenges right now that are arguably larger in size that they  can directly map themselves to.

Second, I really feel this  article is counterproductive on some level.  After all, we were just  told two weeks ago that we only have 12 years to save humanity.  With  some articles literally calling for the end of humanity by 2050.  So,  how do these numbers track to those, and if they don't why are we  surprised when those we are trying to engage are less than engaging.

Given  this is our daily truth, and we are trying to engage as many people as  possible, I'd really enjoy hearing from the group about how and what we  need to do better if our goal really is to better engage and catalyze  change.",True

Ask me anything.",71,1716999496.0,70,0.79,1d3g4e6,politics,"Hi Reddit. I’m a reporter with Bloomberg Government in Washington, D.C., covering the 2024 congressional elections, redistricting, and money in politics. I’ve been with Bloomberg for more than 10 years, and before that I worked as a political reporter at CQ. I write the “Giroux’s Gem” feature for BGOV’s Congress Tracker newsletter. 

What would you like to ask me about the 2024 congressional elections? What are the prospects for Democrats to win control of the House and for Republicans to win a majority of seats in the Senate?

Could both chambers flip in opposite partisan directions? What are some states and districts worth watching in the primaries and general election? Which members of Congress are in danger of losing re-election?  How will redistricting influence the elections?

Edit: Thank you so much for all of the excellent questions! I love interacting like this. I may respond here and there if there are additional compelling questions so don't hesitate to ask.
